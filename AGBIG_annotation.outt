no God bless you Mr President! You the best!!!
yes Thank you President Trump
no God bless President Donald Trump
no 
yes How sad. Bless you.
no Kim Miller oh you must be ok with killing babies too
no Dante Noel   A liberal loon not supporting this "POLICY!"  Perhaps you should have studied something that would have given you a career and at the same time taught you how to properly construct a sentence!   Perhaps you could move to the Hague and sit on the UN's International Court of Justice!!! You know, the Court that caters to dictatorships and terrorist regimes, while degrading and finding fault with  democracies, especially Israel and the United States!!!  I'm sure you'd fit right in!!!!
no Antonio Acquarelli end running Congress is true overreach.  Take off your MAGAt hat and give your brain some oxygen.
yes Tragically they don't seem to care one bit.
yes I was working for an employer who had hired illegal immigrants and didn't notify the staff that had been working there. One of the younger a_ _ holes invited me out to his place for a beverage, the boss's son even said he'd be there so I thought nothing of it (we both were young and he wasn't bad looking) so I kindly accepted the offer (2nd mistake) 1st was even talking to him in the 1st place. We planned a time and he gave me the address, now keep in mind I was currently residing in a smaller town where at this younger age it didn't seem to be an issue to go to someone's place.  Upon arriving I had to go through a cattle gate, house was out in the country, upon arriving to the house, there were more guys out there than I had originally thought there would be. I then decided that MAYBE this just wasn't a good idea and I was trying to leave in my car, never had gotten outside of it. I found out that there were a couple of men outside and they had chain locked the gate closed and I NOT wanting to destruct property, demanded they open the gate. No one would open the gate, one other guy had made his way into my car and forced me over and drove me back to the house where there were 7 maybe 8 illegal immigrants and a 50+ yr old Male who MIGHT have been a U.S. resident. They dragged me into the home where they forced themselves on me, forced liquor down my throat and then proceeded to take me into a bedroom where I continued to fight them off of me, one by one they all took turns, they all were all over me and it then became a group thing, I fought and fought what seemed like hours, once everyone had their fun, I managed to crawl myself into the bathroom, near the bedroom I was in and in there the 50 yr old man put me into the shower, by know the liquor had kicked in and I was pretty much a lump on a log. So I was finished off in a shower with this horrible 50+ yr old and left alone once all were done having there fun. I yelled and screamed I kicked and clawed I threw punches I even tried to bite, by the time I came too I was naked in a cold shower and even though I was still pretty well lit, I was able to get just enough on to get myself out of the house and my keys and get in my car where I was able to then escape any future sexual assaults. I wasn't even sure if I was going to be held longer or released. I tried to file charges, but after that night all men were on the run including the older man himself. So nothing had ever come of it other than me getting counseling. BELIEVE WE HAVE TO BUILD THIS WALL TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN.  I would NEVER wish a gang bang on even my worst enemy. I have gone through counseling and I have over come my situation. I have a daughter now, and I fear that she NEVER EVER endures such a HORRIBLE HORROR.  This happened about 12 years ago, but it has only gotten worse  since then with the population of illegals.  Let's protect our future!
no Absolutely
no my president!
no Dam Melissa Lamphere, they get butthurt soooooo quick. How dare you talk about the GREAT ALMIGHTY DICTATOR!!!!!
yes Steve Martin Your an idiot and probably want socialism  ....
no We The People witnessed this week the One'n'Only Mr. Fake News manufacture a Fake Crisis that he tries to sell to us with nothing but Lies and Fake News Alternative Facts!!!
yes It will do nothing for drugs, those come through ports of entry not across a random stretch of the boarder. But again believe the propaganda you are being fed.
no If you believed in protecting people, youd be pursuing fact-based security measures and not a silly medieval wall in a time when Ladder technology is plentiful and cheap. https://www.homedepot.com/p/Werner-32-ft-Fiberglass-Extension-Ladder-with-300-lb-Load-Capacity-Type-IA-Duty-Rating-D6232-2/100664518Werner 32 ft.

yes To clarify. My "like" is for preventing more of this.
yes Families in Illinois werent protected yesterday!!! Apparently THEY  werent your priority...
yes Yeah a wall doesn't fix tunnels or airplanes must I keep going ?
no Those guarded walled in people say no this man knows why
no we do...we enforce those laws everyday
yes Kim Miller The reason why you have a problem right now is because you got a whole lot of bad people into your country that use those weapons in a bad way.  When you try to steal the power from an American what he do? He take his gun and go get back whats him.  Some law give you some power that you don't seem to appreciate
yes Trump morons...
no Thank You Mr President for Wanting to Keep Us Safe I know the Democrats Dont care because They will lose Illegal Votes but I know You Care Thank You.
yes Protection means we the people have the right to our weapons!
yes (Some died.  Ban immigrants and build a wall)
no Plus....prevent pandemic
no We need protection.....from Congress. Thank you President Trump. Don't sign the bad deal. Shut down the Gov. if you have to. Do an extension.
no How tragic.
yes Stuart Schnapp you are a dumbass German
no Thats a tragic case but if we want to stop illegal immigrantion wouldnt it be smarter to have an effective solution utilizing surveillance (like drones with thermal imaging) instead of a wall that will take forever to build and which the experts say will not be effective?
no Kris Landers we are not saying citizenship status is the reason it happened. That's not the argument. The argument is, that will proper enforcement, this person would of never been in the country, and this tragedy would of been prevented. I hope that brings clarity.
no And I had my vehicle cracked into in a parking space, causing substantial damage, by an Asian immigrant who had decided he could squeeze into it in back of me for some bizarre reason.  He spoke no English, had no idea of American rules of the road, had no insurance, and was driving a car not registered to him. Where do we put the wall to keep those like him away?
no An America killed my best friend where should we build a wall to keep out?
no Seems like a lot of stories of illegals killing or other crimes against American citizens. Why dont we have a march of all the victims and family of victims from illegal aliens. I bet it would be quite large.   That needs to be organized.
no Democrats care about the flag (keep it holy) guns (keep'em close by) God (use his name often) and acquiring money by any means. Oh yea I meant republicans
no Build that fucking wall!!!!!!!!!
no Nancy Hissa provide proof
no A USA citizen , who is white supremacist killed the daughter of another parent, but you didn't call him  a white supremacist,  how ironic.
yes Dave Thompson what are you even babbling about?
yes An illegal grown man punched my 3 yr old granddaughter in the face.  A different illegals 9 year old daughter sexually assaulted my same granddaughter when she was 5. So I am strongly supporting this wall!
yes Only if Mexico pays for it.
no How many children have been killed by Americans?
yes It is sad that Democrats have no feeling for American loss of life..  Just seem to intensely care for Latinos trying to get across the border.
yes Bill Johnson MAKE AMERICA WHITE AGAIN.... Thats what you people want.  Scared its getting too brown you
yes James Ellis great response, keyboard warrior.
no Charlesetta Brown who told you that?Ask some people living near the border!
yes Soo sorry for your loss, I agree, we need to protect our borders...,
no So very sorry for your loss. Build the wall
yes Sorry about your daughter but I'm agree with you
yes Protect Americans
yes Peter Stock Your understanding is very limited Peter, your one of the pagans of the world and a FB troll. And thanks for proving my comment how we as Trump supporters have also dodge the poisonous darts from people like you with your insults. We have battled demons like you for decades. But thanks for reading it. Hopefully some seeds will grow from it.
yes God bless you !
no The enemy is within our own country and in government - President Trump they hate you because you are putting the American citizens first, then them second. The Dems and RInos are use to being put first and the citizens get something. Thank you for standing up for the American citizens and American values.
yes And the other 99% of Americans killed were killed by legal American citizens.  So let's focus on the 1%.  That really makes sense.  SMH
yes Linda Durbin he should use the money for education because your grammar is atrocious.
yes Daniel Alexander Allen are you mentally defective? We have sovereign countries for a reason. Illegal alien means you are not supposed to be here and don't just get to waltz your way in here.
yes Those who oppose a wall are obviously hoping to support illegal activities. Search your soul. The cost is a non-issue and pennies in the dollar compared to the outrageous waste of our government.
yes Nancy Harris are you also complaining about the billions of taxpayer dollars sent to Jordan to build THEIR wall?
no Thank you Mr President. Keep up the hard work and God bless you and protect you. If you need me, call me
yes Build the Wall and build a wall around the liberals and California...
no CONS AND CRIMINALS ! Don't forget what we are dealing with
yes Any intelligent American agrees with the wall.
yes Statistically, you are more likely to be killed by an American than an illegal immigrant. That's a fact.
no 200 a day? I call BS on that. The numbers of illegals crossing are way down from a decade ago according to the immigration and security services. This is BS
no Deborah Bartlett, how is this funny?
yes How does one have a criminal past but not be deported if they did not have legal documents to stay here? This is more then just a wall. The justice system sucks and needs fixing.
no Calls a national emergency. Leaves to go play golf for two days.
no Apple Rivera Liar!
yes Lee N Kristen Wilcox instead of lashing out why don't you answer the question
yes Just saw what Apple said , DOH
yes We could protect ourselves if our government would adhere to the constitution! Whats up with 50 state ccw you talked about????
yes Temicka Brown no your democrat plantation doesn't care about you, try and keep up.
yes God blesses you Mr. President
yes Thanks  We Agree!. So sadly and Sorry for Your Lost!. MAy God Keeps Blessings you and Keeps You Stronger!. Than you can Helping other It yo Los They Love One Next!. Amen
yes ...and democrats support these illegals!  Makes me sick!!!
no Blame all these murders on the people who voted for democrats.
no Imagine if there was not a wall! What would happen? Probably, and Im just speculating here, that illegals would simply walk across and enter our country and disappear. Illegal and undocumented, and unable to find work, they would either simply exist off tax payer dollars, straining our system, or commit crimes to get money. All the while  our vets and homeless continue to suffer, living on the streets and in makeshift shelters. And sanctuary cities and states increase your taxes to provide illegals with free benefits - food, housing, medical and education while ignoring our citizens first! This is wrong. If they seriously want to better Their lives, do so legally and obey our laws. Is this what we want America to become? Is this why some support santuary cities and states?   Consider this last point. All countries across this planet use some type of a physical border, barrier or even a simple sign post to let you know that you are entering their country. They do this for many obvious reasons, one of which is to inform you that you have crossed into their sovereignty and that you must obey the laws of their land.  Same here when you think about the continental US, between states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii). Each state has boundary lines established - sign posts and in some cases check points to let you know that you are entering theyre state and that different state laws are in effect, that different state taxes may be in effect et cetera. If borders do not matter, then why would states need them, or why should their be any localized laws  of any kind in place? The reasons are obvious and our country needs a border.
no Ban guns.
yes Carl Ostendarp where are you 300 or more a day
yes HAVE YOU ACTUALLY SEEN THE NEW  WALL PARTS BUILT?
no WWG1WGA! BUILD THAT WALL! praying for all of our protection.
no Build the wall!!
yes Respectable Mr. President Jii. Thank you Mr. President for working so hard for us American Citizens. MAGA
yes Hal Eric Mitlitsky you're a moron! If it stops just one, that might be the one that would have killed your daughter or son. Stop listening to CNN
no what about all the mass shootings you have in America? Pretty sure thats not related to immigrants!!
no I would suggest that you deal with the ones you have at home first then.
yes Blanca Gonzalez very sorry ma'am! God Bless you and yours.
no Nothing against building the wall but arent they coming through underground tunnels???
yes All these mass shootings are being done American people what are you going to do about them?
no Thousands of Mexicans die with weapons that you pass through the border, please build the wall
yes Chris Halliday maybe you need to look at and speak to different people.
no Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep. Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! --Luke 6:25-26
no Danny Jones-thank you for your faith and support for President Trump and our country. Hope things will get better for your country.
no Anna Sophia Wheland Don't hold your breath. I'm still waiting for someone to explain to me why the lax gun laws cause gun violence in areas with strict gun laws, yet the problem doesn't happen in the places with the lax gun laws.
yes So sorry for your tragic loss.  Yes Pres Trump is doing the right thing.  It is unbelievable what the democratic party is doing to this country.  As long as we have Trump we have a chance to save this country.  Thank God for putting him in the White House.  It breaks my heart to think what our country will be like when my grandchildren are grown.  All grandparents need to contact their congressmen and let them know we're tired of their games and they need to do their job, support our President and protect this country.  Good vs evil.  Which side are you on?
no God Bless Trump and all his efforts to keep us safe
no Learie Jordan The opiate problem in this country was caused by our own drug companies, it's the reason for the demand for heroin. I have no problem with people owning guns, it's the perversion of the laws by the NRA lobby that prevent common sense guns laws that would help keep guns out of the hands of people that should not own them. This emergency declared by the idiot in chief is a manufactured lie. Someone show me that statistics that say that illegal immigrants kill more people than assholes with guns, over 300 mass shootings already this year. WTF! Moe-rons!
no We have criminals on the daily that are citizens including every shooter lately who happens to be a white nazi supremacist that also happens to be extreme supporters of Trump but every once in a while an immigrant commits a crime, big or small, and that's all that matters. Not the REAL crime problem of actual citizens. By no means am I supporting a killer but using it as a political boost is ridiculous.
no SO SORRY for your loss . Apparently the Dems , starting from the top , are and NEVER were for the American citizen. Their behavior is COMPLETELY ABHORRENT!
yes Eva Graham you just might want to edjamcate yourself deary
yes Democrats = Idiots
yes Didn't do much for the concert goers in Las Vegas, the students in Parkland, the people at the club in Thousand Oaks.  But you know what will save Americans?  Safe roads, better infrastructure, better technology, and a REAL President.
yes Just ask the NASCAR Driver's in Daytona this Weekend !!! Walls Definitely Work !!!
no Am so sorry for their losses. Will you please also speak up about all the innocent lives lost due to gun violence?
yes #Trump2020
no What about the natives born terrorists who kill our children and families on a daily basis?
no Pls Like Janam Tv  fB Page  American Support channel  subscribe Janam Tv youtube
no Great Britain.  Enough said.
yes Sorry excuse for a president.  Resign or be impeached!
yes Build the wall . We really need it for all of our protection. Get it done Mr President.
yes Thank you president Trump!
no #LovePOTUSTrump #Trump2020 #SiliconValley4Trump2020
no Finish the super Collider. Unlock the secrets of the universe for only 4 billion dollars. Or,.. build a big steel wall...  https://interestingengineering.com/usas-super-collider-lies-abandoned-texas-desert
yes Too bad we cant trade all these families loved ones who are killed by illegals with family members of these democratic fucks. Hopefully these democratic fuckers lose their family members to illegals. Then maybe theyll see why we need security. But I bet that AOC cunt could have her whole family raped, tortured, and killed by illegals and she would still be like being them all in!!!
yes That would be 1,886 less if they had been in their own country.
yes So much blood on the Democrats hands.  They are getting away with murder over and over and over and over,  when will it stop.
yes Nathan Berg well the thing is you can not prove it. And what your saying is a hyperbole.
yes Why cant we protect the border with thoughts and prayers? Its what we use to protect our schools...
yes So we are going to build a SOCIALIST wall?  Paid for by the people against their will?
no We  need the wall
yes why is this under 'opinion" ?
no Amen
no Fernando Haberfeld ridculo!!!!!
no Alberto Weisz   Let him open Pandora's Box. Remember, once you open Pandora's Box you can't close it.  Donald Trump. Go ahead and declare a National Emergency. One of two things will happen. Either you will lose in court. Or, the next Democratic president will declare a National Emergency for climate change, gun control, DACA, Health Care reform and middle-class tax cuts. Just to start with. 
yes Come to sweden and build a wall aswell please....
yes Walls work that's why there is no drugs and weapons in prison
yes I thought the same thing. Trump is disgusting. His supporters are sycophantic dogs.
yes Thats one up for polosi an Schumer
yes Look at the stats on how many Americans were killed by guns. It's far higher than illegal immigrants but you won't touch gun control because they fund your campaign. It's always about the money with you.
no DonaldTrumpUsaPresident.com .... made in China
no Juanita Craner but mumbers show immigration is low
no Linda Dee Montes you gun clinging morons. If you are a responsible gun owner, whats the panic?
no Danny Jones AMEN
yes #FakeTrumpEmergency  #FinishTheImpeachment #Collusion  #Obstruction
yes Was he a drug dealer or gang member?
yes He came through a tunnel and he was selling fentanyl that flew in from China.
no Trump has such a wonderful agenda to return us back to somewhat normal in resemblance of yesteryear.  Its sad he has such idiots slowing him down.  It must be frustrating.
yes Justice for Dominic Durden, Jamiel "Jas" Shaw II, Joshua Wilkerson, Ronil Singh, Sandra Duran, Kathryn Steinle, Nisa Mickens, Kayla Cuevas and all who were killed by illegal immigrant criminals. #EndSanctuaryCities #Buildthewall
no https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2132377443519082&set=p.2132377443519082&type=3&theater
yes Danny Jones  How is EU membership destroying your culture Danny? Twat
yes Yes, we ask that every time there's a mass shooting committed by a legal U.S. citizen who purchased their gun legally right here in the U.S.  smh...
yes We are praying for all those who have lost loved ones.
yes Carl am German. You are wasting your time,make most Americans understand. This is why the US is so messed up. The most crimes are coming from. AMERICAN CITIZENS.
no Build the wall!!!
yes Trump 2020. He cares about America
yes Patty Bertocchini La Puma that is one officer who would be alive if that illegal immigrant wasn't in this country to begin with
yes Build that wall!Pelosi, schummer,waters kamala,shame on them all!!!
no You mentioned that they use underground tunnel, right? Is building wall making sense?
yes Anthony Clark flint Michigan is being repaired daily. They are literally replacing every inch of piping in the city.  It is most certainly not a 1 day or 1 year project.  It is underway.
yes What about 12,000 miles of coastline anyone can boat through?
yes BabyLuis Hollywood   Mental illness.
yes A white person killed 57 ppl in Vegas , a African American kill 5 ppl in a work place yesterday , a white person killed how many students in Florida?!?!YUP BUILD THAT WALL 
yes I'm so sorry for your loss.
no Not all immigrants are committing crime Mr Honourable President arrest criminals and let the children women and men get assistance or build them a city were there can work on the American system and economy
no Illegal European immigrants killed almost all real Americans some hundred years ago. Do you all forget where you come from. That happen in a country where it is more important to learn how to shoot, then national history as a school subject.
yes If teleportation. Is to be exsplan will transmute demure save the body or. if body anadamy of a female falopeintubes can incubate life preservation geneticly Revitalize - + organisms by molecule
yes You mean the wall that we need because we have people coming over here illegally and breaking laws. Yeah sounds like a national security issue to me. Btw the Constitution also states to protect the American people which a wall does. Understand?
no Another American killed my friend. Is her death any less important than an illegal killing another American?
yes Dakota Puccio its comedy gold when you idiots lump 4 or 5 terms together that are all different, thinking youve pinpointed a group of people. 
yes Gregory Baxter More people die from illegal and prescription drugs and medical mistakes than guns in this country. You people really need to get off gun BS cause guess what Guns arent going any where. They are in our Constitution. Illegal immigration is NOT.
no President Trump is looking out for OUR SECURITY & WALLS DO WORK ! Thank you President Trump
yes Justin Fields,  Which part of making America great do you hate?
no Some people dont want to hear the truth...bet on Beto as one of them...
yes hOLLYWOOD=jEWIISH RUN COMMIE AGENDA
no it's like you guys are in a competition to be the most bigoted
yes Thank you President Trump!!
no Build the wall!  We are not trying to keep people from leaving our country, therefore we are not dealing with a Berlin Wall like situation. This needs to be finished!
yes Illegal immigration is at a 10 year low and there is no extra money going towards vets.
no WE need the Wall !!!
yes Build the wall Mr President
no Heart breaking.
yes Brown immigrants, legal or not, are not inherently dangerous. In fact, immigrants are statistically less likely to commit violent crimes than American-born citizens.   This rhetoric is dangerous & divisive.
no It is the only way to stop it
yes IDIOT! You don't have the house votes or even a legit cause to unseat her never mind impeach her.
no dEmOCrAt CoMMuNisTs!@?#!?
yes If the wall saves 1 life it will have paid for itself.
yes It's about time we impeach the people that are fight President Trump on our border security.  They must have forgotten that their duty is to the American people,  not the rights of illegals
no It's a dangerous world we live in...must keep up our guard...just as we have seen lobbyist pay off Congress and Senators...who's to say that "terrorists-monies" can't be funneled into this country to pay-off local-government officials and police...all along cloaked as just a mere..."friendly-donation"...to be the fuel that supports covert-domestic "sleeper-cells"..."scary-situation"...could or maybe taking place quietly right on our very door-steps??? Always expect the worst case scenarios...
yes WHAT ABOUT THE ONE THAT ARE HERE ?
yes Ah, stupid? trump is guilty of sedition; Pelosi is guilty of representing the majority of Americans in opposing the wall.
yes Laws against drunk driving are already in place and are enforced.  Immigration laws have become relaxed and people try to protect those who come here illegally.  Big difference in how the 2 are addressed.  Did my friend deserve to die when he was walking down the sidewalk and was struck by a female illegal immigrant and thrown 50 feet through the air and spending the next 2 weeks in the hospital before he died. The driver was sober and had no insurance and because of her status as an illegal the state's DA decided not to press charges she lives a happy life in Rockford illinois while an American family weeps.  So how will you defend something like this.  Even more so when the person that killed my friend had no legal right to even be in the country that my friend fought and served for.
yes Idiot
yes Marc Blair but you know what else doesn't work either?
no Dumb ass
no If these two had a baby together the whole thing would just be a long ass forehead
yes Sure it is. Look at the correlation of violent crimes and stricter gun laws in the US.  Then look at how many people overdose. After that, how many people die from the effects of smoking? And, how many innocent bystanders are killed as a result from driving under the influence?
no What about the Americans killed by Americans?
no Keith Webber Jr. he didnt get 8 lol
no Katie Ander I do read and you did not counter one thing I said.  You just come in with a condescending attitude.   Trump went bankrupt with so many of his companies? Yes, he has had 6 companies declare bankruptcy, pretty good considering he has over 100.   Maybe you should try doing a little research into actual data instead of looking for journalists to spoon feed you.
yes Kevin Peevey that's not how any of this works
no Just came to read the illegal killed my family member comments.
yes God Bless You Sir!!
yes WALLS KEPT MY MARRAGE ALIVE FOR ALMOST 22 YRS.
no Love this President!!!
yes great leader
yes No offense to anyone who loses a family member tragically..but 380 million people live in the country. Far more people are killed by white American citizen drunk drivers and crazy white Americans shooting up schools. Is there a 'wall' to make them feel like something is being done to make sure it doesn't happen again?
no It is disgraceful that you are using these families and their grief to further your own political gain.
no Curtis Rice Sir, youre so clever, youve blown my mind...
yes Jess Castrejn I think the point is that had he not been in the country (was here illegally) he wouldnt have killed her
yes Those laughing at this terrible story are truly sick people.
no Thank you. Im so saddened by these loss these families has experienced. Youre doing whats right Mr President.  Youre on the right side of history and thats American Patriotism
no Sorry for your loss
yes President Trump
no Hal Eric Mitlitsky if there ever will be another democratic president. All the reasons you just mentioned are reasons why there shouldn't ever be one again.
no Democrats hate President Trump more than they want to keep Americans safe. Build the wall now.
yes Denise Pinto Chenier maybe you should lose a child to one, might change your mind...
no You're disgusting for not having normal compassion for a man who lost a child. Hatefulness is the new normal for liberals it appears.
yes Build the wall. Trump cares about America and legal citizenship.
no Heard this man on Fox and Friends Sunday. Very articulate and passionate. Great spokesperson. So sorry for his loss
yes Dave Callender well if we can cancel out the law of people coming in legally these we can get rid of every law and be a lawless country ! Fine by me but will you be ok with it Santa Claus when a criminal is at your door ? Im guessing no you smart ass
yes Of course walls work, even a retard knows that! Democrats know that, too, but they just wanna oppose President's agenda every chance they get, even if it affects the country negatively and even if Americans have to die in the process! Really sad and pathetic band of traitors!
yes Emily Neal The only way to prevent the government from becoming  too powerful is our guns. TYRANNY. Protection
yes *too
no Thank you President Trump for the wall!!
no Thank you for keeping Americans safety first Mr. President
yes LMAO LMAO, Americans killed 68, 783 last year with guns... illegal immigrants killed 34 thats homiides and motor accidents included...sorry for there lost.... but this argument is a omplete joke
no Mr. President, if El Chapo" Guzmn pay for his freedom to building the wall, it will safe USA lots of money and make safe for our country with no cost to us, please think about it, Thank you for your hard work, 90% of USA citizen appreciated your hard work to make our country safe and please do not listen to the fake news, Thank you again
yes Thank-you our hearts break for your loss
yes And what did the family do.
no IF YOU KILLED AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT THE DEMS WOULD DEMONIZE U
no He agrees!
no Ruben Soriano, arent you happy Trump is golfing this weekend?
yes Dave Callender Oh thats real smart its not that accident dont happen to everyone its that They had no business being here to cause the accident not having insurance because they are illegal youre real smart
no Stephen Edwards then take your front door off where you live and see how long before you have uninvited company.
no Stay strong, build our wall, and secure our borders at all cost. Donald Trump and only Donald Trump in 2020. MAGA.
yes I bet if that was Pelosi standing there with a picture of her kid that was killed by an illegal I will bet my life the wall would be built
yes This year when you get a Tax Bill instead of a Tax Refund just remember, your hard earned money went to some Billionaire who really needed a tax break.
yes President Trump....Please build that wall.
yes Holly s...t. iam Sorry. God Bless you Trump Baby :-). Iam Wish a better world for us.
no Jeanie Railsback ever thought your building skills are less than par.
no It is normal for Human Beings to loath someone like Trump that constantly lies to them like the vast majority of Americans do!!! So why does the Trump Cult so easily accept Trump's constant lying to them??? That is very abnormal! .......though of course Cult's throughout history have always excepted this disgraceful behaviour from their false idol!!!
no You know best President Trump!! You do what you need to do!  Your base is behind you
yes How did Joel Velazquez get to the country? I can't find anything saying how or when he came here.
yes President Trump, if you are for the American people, then veto the spending bill. It has in it to abolish ICEs authority to arrest and get funding from the treasury!! Also, the $1.7 billion is for the Rio Grand if and only if the residents vote for it, just 55 miles only. No one read this bad for Americans bill before they voted on it!! Mitch McConnell lied to you, there are land mines in this bad bill!! Im tired of my money going to illegal aliens, and there is $443 billion dollars for them in it!! If you dont veto this bad bill, how can I vote for you again in good conscience and expect you to be on our side!! Ive lost my healthcare because they have taken my refund for two years, but illegals get free healthcare!! Not right!! Im almost 60 years old, and worked hard for what I have!! President Trump, you promised a wall, but not a bad spending bill!! The democrats are not for the American people, the republicans are not for the American people, but you President Trump are the only person for the American people and myself!! Please keep America safe, veto the bill and Build The Wall!! Thank you President Trump, and God bless you and your family!! God bless America!!!!
yes The news on the left will not report of this. They are full of hate for TRUMP and don't want our country to succeed they care about illegal aliens more than Americans. So sorry for your loss.GOD BLESS YOU !
no Thank you mr. President for putting America and Americans first. We stand with you 100%.
yes Joseph Nowik There is big difference between building a wall on our border and trying to revoke our rights. If you cannot see that you're a moron.
no Kris Landers and who should we blame for this? https://fox17.com/news/local/undocumented-immigrant-snuck-into-lebanon-home-raped-6-year-old-girl
no Emil Drr Really, from germany?!  How is the muslim take over under your glorious merkel going?! Asshat!
no The wall is looking better and better
yes Thank you President Trump for fighting for us. Trump 2020
yes Trump is staying relevant as the wall is the only issue he has to stand on.  Unfortunately people are biting on this.  Child poverty, inequality, high infant death rates, gun crime, corporate greed...These are the burning issues that Trump can neither fix nor wants to address.  Building a wall is easy.
no Lord Jesus is coming back soon
no Good
yes How many illegals are committing all those mass shootings we hear about weekly. Aren't they just mostly citizens with guns.....duhhhhh
yes Sorry for all the loss of lives to our people.  The illegals shouldnt have even been here....  we are just learning how corrupt many of our Congressmen/women and senators are...much of this death and dying is their fault for not upholding the laws of our land already in place..
yes Except, of course, that there is none.
yes Flint Michigan needs $167 million to fix their water problem. Why isn't this a national emergency?
yes God bless our President! We the people support our President! Build the walls!
no Personal tragedy does not equal a national crisis.
yes He has them working at his country clubs
no BUILD THE WALL
yes Apple Rivera So sorry you went through that. Enterprise should take responsibility. Hope they find him but probably not unfortunately.
yes when are people going to see that we need the wall now
yes No they should have stayed in home country.
no William Klier   How about you ask the parkland shooter families how happy they are about a wall but no gun reform
no Does anyone not think that the Democrats are corrupt and making money from groups that profit from the illegal immigrants and drug smuggling coming across the border?
yes You are a joke. You will never get your monument to stupidity.
no A American president killed my country I feel your pain
yes Don't cherry pick
yes Nancy J. Seddon liberals lack common sense. Heck now they have several that support killing full term babies and have anti-semites in their ranks.
yes I won't deny the fact that America has a gun problem, though we can't act like illegal immigration isn't an issue.  While not every immigrant is a threat to society, we cannot deny the fact some of them are, even if they're a minority. Some are even wanted criminals.  Not to mention that if Orange-man were to actually implement stricter firearm control, there would still be a lot of contraband crossing the border because of the lack of immigration control. Not just drugs, but unlicensed weapons as well.  They're basically fuel for the black market which puts unlicensed weapons in the wrong hands. this in itself is valid reason to encourage possession of a firearm to protect one's self against this threat.  I think that fixing (or at least minimizing) the contraband problem is the first step towards implementing a better, more efficient gun control project since the population will feel more secure.  Whether building a wall is the best solution is up for debate. On the surface it looks extreme, but we won't know its efficiency until it's finalized. Until then, people will have a valid argument to defend both the second amendment and the wall. Pierre-Luc Vachon
yes What about all those non illegals that murder like yesterdays shooting...how is a wall going to protect us. National emergency si gun control not trumps promised wall.
no Learie Jordan lol no one made a gun comparison?  keep em coming. This is like skeet shooting.  yeeyee
yes Please Mr. Trump, build the wall as fast & secure as you can. Lives depend on it!
yes So   Sorry
no Judy Mike Hare
yes Wendi DelValle if a white guy wouldve done the same thing, would you be wanting to banish white dudes from the country? Sorry for the loss of your brother.
yes Can use my tax money to help build a wall
no My husband worked the boarder during his 22 years in the military & the horror stories he can tell. Thank you President Trump for protecting our country. We welcome anyone who wants to come LEGALLY!!!
yes A illegal shot my 17 year old niece in the face.  If you think it won't happen to you or one of your loved ones, THINK AGAIN.
yes Thank you President Trump for working so hard for American citizens first! The democrats know walls work they just want to resist anything you want. Keep up the great work!
yes M......f......ers!
yes Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
yes Apple Rivera if this story is even true, which I doubt, because Enterprise would have told you that whoever they rented that truck to is responsible for any loss or damage incurred by that truck.  You did get the licence plate from the truck, didn't you?    And guess what ijit, if you rent a truck from Enterprise, a car from Hertz, etc, and you let anyone drive it that is not on the contract YOU signed, your butt is responsible.
yes Why do liberals in Hollywood have walls around their homes?
no How did that illegal get here?
yes Curtis Rice would not make it back in the country then.....
yes George Brakey when is cult 45 going to wake up and realize we need sensible gun reform?
no The war on drugs..terror..illegal immigration...mental health...better health care...the list is endless...The President  has centries of political bandaids to peal off..what a mess.
yes And even if he gets 8 billion that won't build the wall that's just a start dumb ass he will have to come up with 25-67 billion to build the wall. So have another beer moron. I'm sure the last 3 brain cells are starting to sober up
yes So sorry for your loss and everyones loss because of the invasion of illegals.  Every country on the face of the Earth requires foreigners to visit them legally.  It is insane liberal bullshit that has prevented us from securing the border. Trump has done what no president has done before.  He has taken his job seriously.....
no David Crteur
yes Stand firm, Mr. President! You're doing a great job for ALL Americans! 
yes According to Jim Acosta the person is allegedly an illegal immigrant.
yes Gato Gato dont forget drugs gangs cartel human trafficking. Not just killings
yes Promises made must be kept, allocate 20billiom for the wall and complete it within a year, NO Compromise!
no The only thing he cares about is his EGO! he really dont give a crap about you or your family look at the USA debt he got us in. 22 Trillion.
yes Linda Gurtz Hildreth do you really think her tax records are for real?
yes Kim Lamphier just because I don't think everything you said should happen doesn't mean I support the mass shooters. Do you even understand how dumb that statement sounds?
no Steven J. Champlin once the wall is built, the crime rate and illegal crossings and human/drug trafficking will diminish. Won't eliminate it but will diminish.
yes I could see dad tearing them a new one trying to cross
no Build the wall.
yes LET S BUILT
yes The Wall is a figment and an fixation of Trump's sick twisted narcissistic mind! Mr. President!! Get help!!
yes That statistic is for LEGAL immigrants, my wife being one  100 US citizens are the victims of violent crime at the hands of illegals every day  If one of your loved ones was a victim, perhaps you would reconsider your position
yes I bet all them study's where by lying Democrats
yes Theresa Boyd these statistics are absolutely shocking, yet people don't think there is a crisis? It's unbelievable that people hate the President more than they care about the safety of pur citizens. These are the FACTS that can't be refuted. Thank you for sharing this. It reaffirms what I already knew. Build the Wall!
yes Merriam Webster , Wall 1a : a high thick masonry structure forming a long rampart or an enclosure chiefly for defense often used in plural
yes Charlesetta Brown r u crazy one crime ? Open yoyr eyes . There is crime by the hour from these illegals. Not to mention these drugs are kids are getting from them. You people need to wake up
yes Sharon Fantana here's a simple one for you take your front door off take your back door off you'll be safe.
yes Don't sign that Bill! It expands our already broken immigration system!
no I so agree with the wall. I am tired of the demos saying that he American people don't want the wall. how dare they speak for the majority of the people who are all in for the wall. demos don't  answer for me. build the wall. trump 2020
yes It only matters to regressives if it personally affects them. Then they say everyobe else lacks empathy
yes Hopefully VietNam too
no 0 build the wall that's all there is to it
yes the lawmakers who are opposed to the wall don't give a damn about American families
yes Killed one of my cousins friend right in front t of him sorry fir your loss!
yes Keith Webber Jr. Trump used them as a prop.  Where were Parkland parents?
no Rose Mary O  nope they generally end up dead which is nice but if not the get life not one of the last 20 shootings did any of them get to plead insanity they either got life with no parole or were dead at the scene
yes Deborah Bartlett  yes.... Mexico is a level 2 same as Germany, Italy, and Antarctica.   However, Mexico has more murders than all the other countries in the world combined!  Its more danger than a level 2!
yes The Wall Has To Get Done Protect The American People Stand With Our Great President Trump God Bless All
no MANDATORY E-VERIFY!!!!! MANDATORY E-VERIFY !!!!!!!!!!!!  https://www.facebook.com/DMLNewsApp/videos/344302992850242/
no Ok just to educate you, and show you that danny the blue nose doesn't know what he is talking about. The uk has a budget of 18 billion gbp for the EU, we get 5 billion gbp back as an immediate rebate and another 4 billion gbp to spend on public services therefore the net contribution is about 9 billion gbp. Replied back soon enough for you twat
no Curtis Rice thats not how statistics work
no Kimberly Ortiz yes with Lego Stones in Oval Office.
no Ed Ward duh does the word undocumented mean anything to you?
no Wooow  if we all thought The same as the world would  be
no Thank you a 1000 times. And the rest of my life, thank you Donal Trump.
yes Build That Wall Mr President !!!! Time to take border secruity to a next level of wall protection..
yes I wish the POTUS would share on national fake news the previous dem president's speeches which call for border protection and immigration reform. I know Clinton made a speech on this during one of his state of the union addresses.
no 4000+ Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants (that we know about)!
no So sad! What a beautiful young lady!
yes Let me guess,demo.
yes Jack Burton you are a moron.
no Remember the Democrats talking point. It's only a few Americans that get killed ,and that is OK
yes My cousin was hit by illegal, no insurance, half blind and unable to work for months. Only her insurance pay for about $30,000 and end paying all bills until now... to make it worst she is suffering  a visual damage for life.
no Stephen Mattison how on earth can you compare a job in a steel factory with a job ... were you need to commit mass murder..  Propaganda? The only person I see is a leader of the free world. Nothing more, nothing less Beyond understanding.
yes Nearly 40,000 people had died from guns last year  just saying Who are you going to go after in this big  one
no R.I.P....()....
yes Can moms of children murdered by guns be called "Angel Moms", or is this just a soundbite for the wall you aren't getting? Did you copyright the soundbite?  lol
yes Lynn Limauro Floyd sorry for your loss, but there are white kids shooting up your schools and killing a lot of innocent children the whites have been killing and raping since you set foot on American soil. No one did anything to you.  Building a wall will not protect you from danger.  Zimmerman killed a young boy and got away with murder.  Who feels sorry for his parents. They received no justice. The Native Americans were massacred and given smallpox and had their land taken away.  What about them.  As soon as you white people loose someone to any race but your own you want to act uo, save it.  You are no better than anybody else.
no Make America Safe Again!!  This President cares about America and it's people!!
yes lol Mexico isnt paying  Americans tax money is paying for the wall
yes We need Wall President Trump
yes President Trump please build the wall. Stop the alien invasion & secure America.
yes So now he supports 45? Last year he told 45 to stop using his daughter as excuse to be a shitty person. SMH all you ignorant asses kiss my round black ass. What do we build for all the white boys shooting up schools and bars? More privileged institutions to continue to protect their futures? Keep Amerikkka great.
no Michael Thompson you mean places that are surrounded by states with extremely lax gun laws ?
no Kris Landers This is so you here idiot! https://youtu.be/wDYNVH0U3cs
no Sorry. The deaths of Americans is not important enough for the Demonuts to agree to a wall.
no I feel more radars and imigration agents will be better then a stupid wall. Since he seems to want Hispanics out.
yes Albert J Destefanis I prefer to think of it more as sewer than a swamp. Sewage goes out a Democrat and after going through the sewage treatment plant comes back a Republican.
no Decline or not it's still a problem and it would help continue the decline allowing for focus to be driven elsewhere to further decline illegal immigration.
yes Sharon Et Trina Bratley  American drunk drivers get let off too !
yes Thank you Mr. President, sent here by God to serve as our president, for diverting money into a wall and completely ignoring the global crisis of climate change, so when millions are displaced by rising sea levels, the wall will protect us!
yes Build the wall!!!!!!!
no Build that wall
no Yes we must!
yes And no one has killed an illegal immigrant in the US
yes Kim Miller fucktard
no Well that and he endorsed Hillary for President !!    MAGA
yes If it ain't guns they will use bombs go educate yourself. These gun laws don't work for criminals dumb ass
yes Gregory Baxter look whos calling who a moron, you cant even spell.
no Build the wall
yes 100% supporting him
no A us citizen killed my father.should we ban them?
yes I guess it would be to much to ask Baby Killers to have sympathy for angel families and people who have died from drugs that have come across the border, sad....
yes Jeanie Railsback and the democrats want to expand government health care to the whole country. SMH
no Christine, Thank God, atlas the so called the oldest democracy have realised to protect its own people, after committing genocide, grab land and resources of native American tribes. Hopefully, your great President will protect native American sincerely now unlike scolding Elizabeth Warren!
yes Justin Fields you are an idiot!
yes What about the many who saved
no Jeremy Harbolt  https://www.facebook.com/dave.reiser.9/videos/10213329614251019/
yes Lisa Mann No all the surveillance won't be as effective. And no they won't find a way to get over or under with the right wall. Ex.. Isreal has a wall that is 99.9% effective. We need that.
no Marianne Duboy but he wont talk about the fact thats hundreds of americans are killing thousands of americans every year because there is no gun control. aaaah those americans
yes Build that wall President Trump! #TRUMP2020
yes #FINISHtheWALL  #TRUMP2020 #AMERICA1st
yes And what about all the Americans that kill each other? How about putting that percentage out there?
yes "Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open." Well said.
yes Lots of parents children die from gun violence. So lets eliminate all the guns!   Oh wait let me guess bad guys will still get guns? Just like bad guys will go through tunnels into our country or come here on expired visas?   But yes lets jack up our taxes for something that wont work.
yes Terry G. Taylor That would be a great step in the right direction.  Also,  fine employers that hire illegal aliens knowingly.
yes They are attacking the followers of Juan Guido in Venezuela the regimen of Maduro https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10217092818249013&id=1125415212
yes Renieri Ortiz , and that is proof that we need to defend our country.  Look what our ancestors did to the Indians
no Jeanie Railsback, I lost my husband too, and he also died here at home. He was a Veteran from Vietnam era and evidently the VA got his records mixed up with someone that served in Afghanistan. He didn't believe me when I told him that I didn't think that the VA Hospital was really trying to help him until about a month or so before he passed away. We didn't have insurance either because we couldn't afford it and be able to live day to day.    To many foreign doctors working there with their own agendas. I don't believe that they have the lives of our Veterans and their families as top priority for surviving.    The Democrats always thought that the WALL should be built until Trump promised to see that one actually would be built. I think that a feasiblity study should have been done as to what the WALL should be built out of etcetera and how to use technology to help with patrolling and monitoring the border before doing a slapdash project.
yes This is bullshit how many American have killed Mexicans
yes A wall wont help.
yes THIS GUY IS A BUM AND EVERYONE WHO SUPPORTS HIM
yes https://youtu.be/HomWHn-gN38
no Americans want the wall.
yes Mark Desautels Jr. Because only Congress appropriates funds. Trump is taking funds for other designations and plans to use those moneys for his wall. Understand?
no Very sad! We need the wall built!!!!
yes So sorry this got to stop!!!!!  Just one getting killed by illegal is to many ? I feel for you.... Trump 2020
yes And what about the mass shooting yesterday is that ok
no I love that you put the SAFETY and the SECURITY of our nation first. Unlike many elected officials in Congress. When do we start outlawing the funding by Soros for all these hate groups?
yes Charlesetta Brown one ? Ummm...ya may wanna check your facts
yes John N Karen Morris I think you can call about Jess Castrejn and Sofiane Hamouda lol
no Make America Great! Trump 2020! Build the wall!
yes Keep fighting we are counting on you!
yes If one death justifies 25b spend.....what do the 39 000 annual gun related deaths justify?
no He is the swamp
no And you are living in the stolen land, hey maybe you should start a new movement in the country, and help give it back, by leaving!!!
no Thank you Mr President for working so hard for us American citizens!
no picture says it all
yes A yt male killed my son
yes A wall won't bring your relative back. It will just waste your tax dollars.
no Can I just get my tax money back that you stole let the family deal with their own problem they arent worried about who killed my family member
yes Joseph Nowik , unfortunately that wont happen in the future. The use of a National Emergency to eliminate the 2nd amendment wont happen. Only a fool would try. Global warming seems to be an American thing. The major contributor countrys havent done a thing to deal with it. Healthcare isnt a right. Simply put if a person wants insurance they can buy it. Wether or not they can afford to use it is a different issue.
yes How about we get rid of the welfare magnet?
yes Distractions   #LockHimUp
yes So sorry for your loss
yes Screw the liberal obstructionist anti-American communist slime, Bunch of terrorists !
no I'm reporting John n Karen Morris on suspicion of being in the US illegally. Is that one or two of you?
yes Austin Baker hes using the death to push for his border wall which he INCLUDES in the headline.   EXCEPT a wall will do nothing for illegal immigration. They overstay their visas or come in with forged documents. The ACTUAL drugs and crime come through vehicles through legal ports of entry.   Hes not asking you to pay for immigration suppression but an entire waste of money thats more symbolic of America than it is an effective tools
yes What's going to keep us safe from US Citizens who are felons and shouldn't own guns in the first place but the background check failed?
no Amen build the wall ,it's a more safe way for Americans
no Thank you for putting our lives and safety first!  We have worked hard for our freedom! Dont let our country be destroyed by evil and hate  MAGA - God bless our President Trump! Thank you - totally support the wall
no Best president ever! #maga
yes Just as I do not understand the level of stupidity in people that think it is necessary.
no Fools Abound!
yes So sad that people just don't care others build the wall
yes Robert Dahlquist wrong. Obama did not separate children. This is a trump manufactured catastrophe because trump's not processing asylum seekers humanely.
yes How about we let the parents decide the punishment I would vote for that along with zero benefits Ive been self employed all my life been thru some hard times was told sorry but your not entitled to benefits so you stop the damn freebies Ill bet that would pretty much stop the flow of illegals if me as a citizen of this country cant receive  any assistance than a non citizen sure as hell shouldnt
yes The fucking wall should have been done by now, the last several president were lame and didn't do much for our country. President Donald J. Trump will finish the wall in spite of all the obstruction from these deadbeat liberals. And he didn't say he started it you idiot, open your eyes and ears. The wall was started many years ago and each president has promised to do something but they just take the money run. If you don't listen to what is going on and research for yourself don't criticize anyone else.
no Trump has been accused of raping teen-age daughters, so what should be done with him?
yes FOUR AND OUT!
yes Scott Hunter He could have done the political correct! Put the gun to his head?
yes So sorry about your daughter,  had the politicians been doing their job in securing our country, that criminal would not have been able to do this. We share your sorrow and grief. I have 3 daughters and one lives in California and I am always concerned and worried.  I certainly hope that President Trump is successful in getting it done for the sake of everyone who is a law abiding citizen. We wholeheartedly and strongly support the wall to stop the criminality, the illegal crossings and the madness.
yes Alberto Weisz are you stupid ,its winter it will be too cold.
yes Danny Jones. Yes sir. I dont like say it. Now all Europe countries are invasion by millions of millions migrants every year. 99% are Muslim. Welfare. Medical. Housing. School. You taxpayers pay for them because Europe socialism give freebies to destroy culture. Look at German. French. Paris. Italy. Sweden. Spain. So many Europe countries are destroying by millions of millions migrants each year in Europe.
yes His wife is a tranny named Michael LaVaughn Robinson & Barry knew it cuz He's gay
yes An American citizen murdered over 20 elementary school children.
yes BUILD THE WALL!
no Orange man bad!!!
yes Yes yes yes yes a thousand times yes!!!!!! We have your back!!!
no As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
yes Jess Castrejn has that not been addressed? Their are laws against drinking and driving already.
yes This is so important!  I have five grandchildren, their safety and the safety of this country are critical, it must happen!
yes Donna Hemenway the hell up stupid
no The wall is one thing he is working on not the only one. We needed this wall long before now for a lot of reasons.
no GET 9/11 REINVESTIGATED NOW!!!! ISrael is not your friend. Backstabbers! ZIonism=whabbism same tribe.
no Renee Ladd Magee No it is because the vast majority of the American people recognise that Trump is America's number one Enemy of the State and number one threat to National Security. Trump is the Real True Enemy Of The People and everybody knows it except the Trump Cult!!!
no Eva Graham That is laughable Eva. Trump needs impeaching.
no They are spending $192 MILLION for a facility for illegals.  This is outrages.  Send them home!
yes Stop the underground roads/tunnels that are secretly invading out country. Caterpillar equipment is building the underground. Stop it!!!
yes dems voted for money to other countries , for their walls; so they must think those walls would work(and they are) but walls for our country are immoral and wont work??? LYing democrats
yes then those countries need to address the fact huh?
no http://myupsc.com/important-study-notes-for-competitive-exams/
no 150B bullets against a group that can't figure out which bathroom to go too. I give up...
yes One killed my Uncle too the insanity needs to stop
yes Brian Roy
no That's so sad ...sorry for your loss . This should have  NEVER HAPPENED
yes ............I  HAVE   NOT  KNOW  THE  LONG  DETAIL  ABOUT  THAT..................
yes I like you man
no Truth.... https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jan/23/roughly-80-of-all-voters-say-us-needs-secure-borde/?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=facebook&utm_source=socialnetwork
yes Make a deal with President Trump! I'm sure the United States can make the deal help the United Kingdom too. That's a great thing about being friends.
yes If illegal immigrants are so dangerous why does he employ them at all his Trump properties?! The man lies to your face (every single day) and you love him, that would make you a sucker... 
yes No emergency, for sure. But it turns out the BIGGEST legal weakness in Trumps defense is that NONE of the federal laws his so-called emergency declaration triggers actually authorizes constructing even one mile of his wall! Guess he didnt get around to reading the statutes!
yes What a horrible shame! And the taxpayers are saddled with paying for ALL the illegals living expenses! When is this going to end?!
yes he shouldn't have signed that deal
no Janice Beecher I dont care what they voted against. They contribute to the insecurity of our borders every time they vote against the wall or any other security measures. Politicians should be held accountable for their stupidity and selfishness
no If it was your family member that died, you may feel differently about it.
yes Yes build the Wall.   My condolences
yes He is totally right, we need a border wall just like many other countries
yes A guy came from Indiana to Sebring, Florida and shot and killed five woman.  We should build a wall to keep people from Indiana out of Florida
yes Am so sorry for your loss.......
yes And white American men have killed a MUCH larger number of Americans, but you don't see any mention of guns being a national emergency,  or nazis or white supremacists...
no Resign
yes Good Weekend
yes Where are all the school shooting, church shooting, movie theater shooting, Vegas shooting, sandy hook shooting, and the rest of the shooting victims sitting at your rallies, your press conferences- or is it because Nazis are still good people in your opinion?
no Bill you r nuts this is the WORST president ever liar, unfaithful, gross, vulgar, crazy, giving our country to Russia 4 money friend to communist leaders, ignorant etc,. Etc. Etc. I hope he keeps eating hambuegers ans fries 4 a good ealth
yes Are Pelosi, Schumer others in Congress so cold hearted that they can't feel this pain of lives shattered?
yes Yes, and there are many, many sad stories just like his.  It has to stop!
no Not one comment about those foreheads...
yes whats that got to do with legal or illegal immigration?
no Arent you on vacation... AGAIN? WORK ON THE WEIGHT TUBBY. Your waistline is getting as big as your lies

yes Maida Broadbent Williams Go get some new batteries for your vibrator.
yes Thank you for fighting for us every day!
yes Build the wall from sea to sea.
yes Thank you so much Mr.President.  I apologize for the liberal morons that are so very horrible to you even after you do everything in your power to protect them and their families.  There is something seriously wrong with them.  But they do not represent the hard working self sufficient families in this country and the rest of us are ecstatic that there is FINALLY a leader that "gets it"
no Build the American security wall !!  Trump 2020
yes Felicia Peden Hill    Youre misinformed because youre watching Fake News CNN.
no I support the wall
yes Donna Davis you laugh at a parents loss?
yes The Rio Grande river is too long for a fence on rancher lands. There ARE some walls around cities on the river...so make them stronger.
no George E Simpkins Jr actually there were 323 mass shootings since trumps presidency.
no Pamela Evans Wahler  I totally agree!  Dems were on board under Obama....Whats changed....They just dont want another Campaign promise fulfilled by Trump.
no Build it now
no Ron O'Hearn youre back, thank goodness! Hail Trump, am I right?
yes Absolutely....
yes GO TRUMP !!
no Lloyd Blackband London England
yes Robert you're smart.
yes Thats true.
yes What happened to our tax returns?
yes Thank you for sticking your neck out to keep us safe!  Keep up the great work!
yes Thats his business
yes Finish the wall Mr President
yes Srinivas Ch if Trump will win all he doing ,and com back in 2020 what will you say then ? Will you need to study this history closer and what ever he say he will do he have done many and will do much more Trust God !
no Jrg Sudharson Vimala they ill take care of their issues....y u guys want to intrude in some one's country....can u open ur doors for  unknown humans???
yes Sue Carol
yes Javoris JV Dubose I have to disagree with you I'm not sure what you're doing wrong is everybody in New York is getting a higher refund and last year. So you better find a new accountant even with New York high tax rate we are winning. Maybe you don't pay taxes I don't know why you post this
no The wall is being built. keep going
yes BUILD THAT WALL MR. PRESIDENT
no Thank you for protecting Americans!
yes Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin 10) Combating Opioids  ~Chaired meeting the 73rd General Session of the United Nations discussing the worldwide drug problem with international leaders.  ~Initiative to Stop Opioid Abuse and Reduce Drug Supply and Demand, introducing new measures to keep dangerous drugs out of our communities.  ~$6 billion in new funding to fight the opioid epidemic.  ~DEA conducted a surge in April 2018 that arrested 28 medical professions and revoked 147 registrations for prescribing too many opioids.  ~Brought the Prescribed to Death memorial to Presidents Park near the White House, helping raise awareness about the human toll of the opioid crisis.  ~Helped reduce high-dose opioid prescriptions by 16 percent in 2017.  ~Opioid Summit on the administration-wide efforts to combat the opioid crisis.  ~Launched a national public awareness campaign about the dangers of opioid addiction.  ~Created a Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis which recommended a number of pathways to tackle the opioid crisis.  ~Led two National Prescription Drug Take Back Days in 2017 and 2018, collecting a record number of expired and unneeded prescription drugs each time.  ~$485 million targeted grants in FY 2017 to help areas hit hardest by the opioid crisis.  ~Signed INTERDICT Act, strengthening efforts to detect and intercept synthetic opioids before they reach our communities.  ~DOJ secured its first-ever indictments against Chinese fentanyl manufacturers.

no John N Karen Morris they need to add another # for deaf folks to contact them via cellphone
yes And that millionaire could of got anything he wanted
yes Yes they do!!! Build that wall Mr. President
yes And a wall would have stopped him.... right.
yes Please build the wall ASAP! https://www.facebook.com/72447968144/posts/10156780417403145/
no Proof is, drugs are easily being carried over our boarder, and that same route they use for human trafficking. Whoever wants more proof than what has been provided are the naive ones who overlook the problem because they just plainly hate  President Trump and want an open boarder society.
no Jeanne Lumadue excellent comparison
yes Worked the border for 4 years, got shot at and could not fire back. The taxpayers paid the national guard a fortune to do absolutely nothing but be a pair of eyes. Border patrol gets sniped at quite often and sometimes killed. Is this what we all really want? If you dont want the wall go down there and see for yourself what it's like. You ever heard of the creative use of a chainsaw to cut a live human apart? You tube it. They arent all bad but which ones are? You willing to take that chance? I sure as hell am not. I see both sides of the argument but we should not take chances with the valuable human beings that we are trying to protect.
yes Michael Thompson Let's compare.  I'll let you look up the number of people actually dead from far right shootings/stabbings in teh US vs from undocumented shootings/stabbings in the US just during trump's term to date.  I know you wouldn;t believe the facts if I looked them up for you; but I can give you a hint: the far right victims are higher...
yes Good John.. now call them up and tell them that Mr Trump's BILDERBERG GROUP terrorist organization is  bringing another herd of their slaves to their SOB Grand Masonic lodges..
no Thanks you mr president  chuk de fatte ...u are working very hard for us American  citizens  God bless you
no When are you going to pay the people your stealing land from?
no That's Right!
yes Larry Lubiner next get rid of the ones that over stay visa , hap  to start somewhere
no Silvia Serra Lobo   You need to understand what Danny means by the EU destroying his culture!!!  It's what President Trump and us Trump supporters want to stop from happening here!!!!   FACT CHECK THAT!!!!!
no How can people just not view west coast drug crime and neverending homeless people with drug psychosis as a direct relation with that border
yes Thank you, President Trump!
yes How many American citizens kill each other? Far more than illegals do.
no Build the wall Mr President!
no MaLinda Venatta Pearl Brown Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR
no John Garrison TDS blinds most people of common sense is why! Example,,,who in there right mind would be against border security? Isn't it funny how all these Dems today that say a border barrier or wall is immoral voted for such barriers just a few short years ago but now are against it? Dems don't have a plan to beat Trump's accomplishments  is why there( ALL IN) on not seeing him secure our border! A loss to Trump is a win for them! It's fucking sad too because we the people get hurt in Dems quest for power back going into 2020 elections! Dems are their own worst enemy! They have also brought out the worst in AMERICANS too !
yes Joseph Roy  aaaaaa let see ,a door. Is trumpty  building a door now, a big black  bigly vanity door?  I am  sure Joe  if you wanted to you could break  my door down soooooo I  guess that wouldn't  stop you honey! Again 2019 what is wrong  with modern technology  instead of a bigly trumpty  vanity wall that Mexico isn't  paying for . Answer?
no Protect us President Trump.  No one else seems to care about us.
yes hey scumbag you and your friends can write off your private jets but teachers can't write off a globe for their classroom you're an asshole
yes Gregory Baxter Are you suggesting men aren't killed by the guns in America?
yes BUILD THAT WALL, MR. PRESIDENT!!!
no Build the damn wall.
yes By all means ignore facts showing they commit crimes less often than citizens.  Moron.
yes Good that you don't have 5 billions
no "An illegal immigrant killed someone I love! While 3 people in my community were killed by natural born citizens. But I only care about what directly affects me. So let's focus on the immigrant".  Conservative logic behind the wall. 
yes I have a child. I would support anything that is going to make our society safe for us all. End illegal immigration and build walls. Support Angel moms. MAGA 2020.
no @nancypelosi.  No I dont know if its her just trying it
no What is astounding is how the Democrats ignore your stories and will not go to the wall to listen to the brave men and women who have to defend it.
no Sherry Holcomb fix them all don't put all your eggs in 1 basket
no Notice how he was asking for 21 billion to build the entire wall but only got 1.3 billion from the democrats so he declared a national emergency allocating 8 more billion but everyone is telling him to use El Chapos 14 billion? 14+8+1.3=23.3 billion to build the entire wall. I think trump just got his money to build the wall.
no Robert Dahlquist You did not read the article. Its about how just being an illegal immigrant caused someone to die. Alcohol is mentioned (unknown where it came from), mentioned of out on bail for some assault( once again does not say from where) but does keep saying about immigration status, takes a potshot at cities that do not hand illegal immigrants over to ice (not police job btw).
yes Arturo Rosales ask the Democrats.  Since the large majority of mass shootings arw done by them!!
yes My sincere sympathy goes to the father who lost his daughter by an illegal immigrant and to the angel moms and dads. Our congress men and women need to hear them instead of ignoring them.
no Apowerfulmen,change the world forever
yes Kyle Callender UNFORTUNATELY MEXICAN MEN 1 MAN COMES FOR ASYLUM GETS IT. HE BRINGS ALL ILLEGAL FAMILY ACROSS BORDER THEY GO GET FOOD STAMPS MEDICAID ETC.....THEY DONT BOTHER LEARNING ENGLISH BECAUSE PPL OF EL PASO CATER TO THEM BUT WE AMERICANS GET DISCRIMINATED FOR NOT KNOWING SPANISH.

ILL AGREE TO DISAGREE IM NOT TRYNA ARGUE I STICK TO FACTS N TRUTH.......YOUR HEART IS N RIGHT SPOT BUT AMERICANS 1ST!!!
no Hal Eric Mitlitsky I guess it will all be left up to the Supreme Court.
yes God bless President Trump,  America first
no Rob Egerton  So we are just supposed to add to the problem with doing nothing about the southern border?? Your whatisms don't work here!
yes Oh that really sad
yes President Trump, I am a native Californian.  I want a border wall.  Everyone I know, wants a border wall. Everyone THEY know, wants a border wall.  Legal immigrants WANT A BORDER WALL. #GavinNewsom #NancyPelosi are LYING to you and the AMERICAN/CALIFORNIA PEOPLE, as are many of the politicians in California.  They are making crazy rules and the people are paying the price.  Something must be done and California politicians MUST be taught a lesson.  #DonaldTrump #DonaldJTrump #PresidentTrump #buildthewall #California
no I STAND WITH YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUILD THE WALL!!  You have all these people across the United States protesting against Trump , we need people that are for Trump to STAND UP and  defend our rights.
no Cherry picked outlier data is not a great basis for running a government.
yes FINISH THE WALL WITH ELECTRIC THROUGH IT FOR SURE AND THE BEST DETECTORS  THAT IS MADE IN AMERICA ALL THE MATERIALS SHOULD BE. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THE BESTLEADER NOT ONLY IN AMERICA AND COUNTRIES AROUD THE WORLD ADMIRE YOU SIR AND PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ARE WAKING UP. I WISH ALL AMERICANS WILL DO THE SAME WAY.
no Mueller IS draining the swamp

yes A American kill my  Mother

yes Lee N Kristen Wilcox so no facts just name calling?  Ok good for you
yes Do u know what pee me off is good american people like wendi that has lost a someome and  and people like Nancy Pelosi and some of these other dems won't even give them the time of day to talk to him they just brush him off and say the heck with them
no This country is not going  to look like ours any more.  I took my sister to the emergency room 10:00 p m. one night and most all of the people there were Hispanic.  No one was speaking English.  They brought in food which smelled the emergency room up and talked on their phones some with the speakers on.  More than  likely had no insurance.
no Dont sign the bill!!!!
no yes we must  this stuff has been going on way too long..
no And people still not happy!
no Emil Dorr, there's not going to be a wall. Also there is nothing wrong with Ron Gagnon IQ. I understood him.
no So sad , something must be done! Build  that  wall.
no How stupid have we become as a people to not even defend our borders, we deserve whats coming.
yes dumoratts COULD CARE LESS ABOUT DEAD AMERICAN CITIZENS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
no O its getting built dems
yes Trump.
no Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin 6) Deregulation ~ *( tax cuts and deregulation is why the economy is doing so well)   ~Achieved massive deregulation at a rapid pace, completing 22 deregulatory actions to every one regulatory action during his first year in office.  ~Signed legislation to roll back costly and harmful provisions of Dodd-Frank, providing relief to credit unions, and community and regional banks.  ~Federal agencies achieved more than $8 billion in lifetime net regulatory cost savings. Rolled back Obamas burdensome Waters of the U.S. rule.  ~Used the Congressional Review Act to repeal regulations more times than in history.
yes How many white Americans kill white Americans. Oh  forgot  School shooting  That's AMERICA  for you  Glad to live in  CANADA  Where we're all mixed
yes Ya my tax dollars going for a wall thats not going to stop them
yes So what about the families impacted by mass shootings? Or those who lost loved ones because of inability to afford life-saving medications?
yes Trumps days are numbered.
yes The flipping wall will do nothing.
no http://www.ojjpac.org/memorial.asp
yes They might work built around you & yr crime fam. Let's start there and see.... QUIT USING THE TRAGEDY OF SOME FAMILIES WHILE YOU CAUSE TRAGEDY TO OTHER FAMILIES IN YOUR FOOLS GAME - #SOULESSTRUMP
no Tommy Carpenter money .
yes Yes president Trump build that wall. Dont back down.
yes Obviously a big percentage of our Americans WANT the drugs! You really think the drug addicts in American wont find other ways or do worse stuff to get it here! How can anyone think trump is doing right hes WRONG! Weve never had so many bad things happen like we do since hes been president!! #ImpeachTrump use the wall funding for children with cancer or homeless/jobless people. Fucking bullshit!!
no How many voters are in the US? Over 250,000,000. What is mr.Trump claimed approval rating? 52%. If everyone who approves is giving $50, tata, wall is built. Show your real support to mr.trump.
no Donna Conley Why??? Explain it the World. Because World read also your naive Bullshit  Stay in your Trailor Park Drink Beer play with Weapons and be quite
yes So f*** it that makes it okay just that everybody shoot each other let's go come across illegally.
no Melanie Fuller Pearl Brown Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR
no Unfortunately, there are not just a very few deaths caused by illegal aliens and most people only hear about a few.  This site details a lot of them but is by no means complete; there are many that have not been submitted. No....walls do not bring people back but they do provide security and safety.  Just look at the fences people put around their properties, the walls around the gated communities and homes of the elites.  They are there to keep people who do not belong there out.....plain and simple.  Talk to the families who have lost loved ones.  I personally know such a family.  Talk to the people who have been working the borders......they know more than anyone how much we need the wall, but it seems that people who are nowhere close to those borders and dont know what goes on at them, think that they know better.  http://www.ojjpac.org/memorial.asp
no build the wall trump 2020
yes Love it baby build that Wall https://youtu.be/tlfOPvUABnw
no Sad
no For years this can was kicked down the road and nothing was done. Still more nothing done before, during and after the shutdown. Within 24 hours of the emergency, at least one lawsuit and a committee was formed to investigate. Maybe if these morons worked as swiftly and with such vigor to solve the problem compared obstructing Trump we would be far better off.
yes Shameful.exploitation of family pain. Now multiply that pain by the hundreds that have been killed in mass shootings by white males. Guess we should expell all young white males for these terrible crimes. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
no Nearly killed my son w/Meth & Heroin, laced with Fentanyl, being sold to him by local Hondurans, here in CO. as he told me later. MAD as HELL! #stopthedrugs & #buildthewall !
no So what makes you think a damn wall will keep out illegals?
no TRUMP TRAIN ALL ABOARD!CHOO!CHOO!2020AMEN! FINALLY A REAL PRESIDENT!
yes So it is a competition?! One is not as bad as the other?! It matters when some son-of-a-bitch guns you down?! What an asshat! What part of ILLEGAL ALIEN border jumper, who is not supposed to be here to begin with, do you not get?! As in if the illegals were not here they could not kill anyone you mental midget!
yes <3 God bless Angel Moms (& Dads)! <3
yes Sergio Simone  Because a convicted murder, shouldnt be allowed to come in,
yes Jeanie Railsback  sounds like the doctor was the issue! Not the world
no Seven percent of the illegals crossing our southern border end up in our prison's.  We don't need to import more problems !
yes https://wokesloth.com/trump-gets-roasted-for-declaring-national-emergency-and-immediately-going-golfing/stefan/?utm_content=buffer5461c&utm_medium=facebook&utm_source=thegoodlordabove&utm_campaign=bloomjoy
yes Yes he's RIGHT IF WE DON'T GET IT BUILD NOW IT NEVER WILL
no What a sad, sad, little man.  https://www.facebook.com/199870617084581/posts/544281499310156/
no BC Lynch what's taking so long? It's been a couple years I think.
yes Well you no what he's talking the food of the table .and don't you think there's enough homeless people all ready.what about kids how are they going to eat .and he's putting wall.well every one staves.thats wrong.i pray he will never be are present again.no way.
no Five people were gunned down and  murdered by a crazed American  citizen in Aurora, Illinois,  Meanwhile at the border.....
yes its irrelevant whether the murderer was an illegal immigrant or not..
yes And what about the shooting in Illinois, idiot!?
no 65 countries, worldwide have erected border walls / fences AND they are working.
no Emergency  like  this
yes Eva Graham Impeach her?  How does that work with the Democrats controlling the House, moron?
yes What about the far larger amount of legals killing legals? I can go to a bar on any given night and witness a bunch of people driving off over the legal limit. Beyond drunk driving, legal citizens of the U.S. are far more likely to commit crimes statistically. What are we doing for the far lager amount of people hurt by legals?
yes This is how American citizens treat their children in our own country? https://www.abc15.com/national/texas-parents-arrested-after-young-children-found-locked-in-dog-cage-living-in-squalor
yes Apple Rivera  Maddening and unfortunate for you. Build the wall!
no Kimberly Mansfield compare those killed in mass shooting per year to the number killed by illegal aliens every year.     As for money to help people, illegal aliens cost the US $100+ billion every year.
yes Build the wall. Real Americans are behind you and thank you for protecting us!!
yes Must protect lame omelet bar!!!  https://apple.news/AIWuX-87OR7O9vdXaU2Sqsw
yes Take the $14bil seized from El Chapo and build that wall!!! You can then bypass all of the crooked congress that want the drugs here-#winwin Donald J. Trump
no Tommy John most likely he will just create another bill to redo the spending, or take the money from another budget.
no Hal Eric Mitlitsky  you are obviously not keeping up with the news.  No collusion.  Just 2 years of wasted money and time because Dems cant accept Hillarys defeat
no Kevin Marquardt, Nora Arevalo is right they still use tunnels. So whats the point of a wall. And they still drive trucks like you said so again whats the point of a wall?
yes So with the protections you signed after the emergency declaration do negate the wall?  Not seeing it
no And how many Legal  (Americans) have killed the daughters of other Americans ??
no I was almost killed by 5 of them in Texas ! ...oh and yeah they got away with it with no problem at all !
yes It's nice to see the compassion for those who lost loved ones. I too am sorry for your losses. But, a wall will not bring those people back, nor will it protect us from anything. Statists don't lie.  These people guilty of taking lives are no different than anyone else. They just made poor decisions, or chose to be evil. There are many many more people that make bad decisions already here naturally. There are many many more deaths from opioids, starvation, guns than the very few caused by illegal aliens.  I am sorry for you losses. I wish you all peace if you can find it.
no Trump BUILD THE WALL.
yes If criminals use Ports of Entry. Why do they dig so many tunnels along the border?
no Bill Johnson never Mr Tromp he don't care for any one .. only for him .. An I a republican an a vet  ..  toll me Tromp return the money of department of education for veterans
yes Angel Neavin Im sorry to hear that and hope they are ok. When I was 14 years old a car load of illegals had been drinking and they ran into my cousin and her friend (in Texas) who were on a motorcycle. They were killed.
yes I would sue Nancy Pelosi and every person that voted against border security. I would sue the sanctuary cities that put these criminals up for refuge. I do NOT support frivolous lawsuits. However, I do not believe this would be a frivolous lawsuit. I believe it would be a wake up call to those who oppose the safety of the American people.
no Very sad! So sorry for the loss of this mans daughter.
yes We MUST keep our country safe...
no Who killed 5 Americans yesterday!?
no Alexis Lavoie...
yes Dante Noel Your some kind of special.
yes Thank you mr. president for your dedication to kerping us safe. Sorry there are people out there who are so mean about you.
yes Democrats dont want you to be successful because they dont have anything that comes close to what you have dont in two years. MAGA Mr. President
no So sorry for all your losses BUILD THE WALL ALREADY NO ONE ELSE HAS TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF THE DEMOCRATS.GOD BLESS ALL OF THE ANGEL PARENTS AND ANGEL FAMILIES.
no You gotta remember liberals dont care about anyones kids they abort all theirs
yes Hal Eric mitlitski, you are literally too dumb to insult.
yes Terri Reeves there is an enormous amount of scholarly literature on the analysis of REAL data received from border agents and agencies. There is an enormous amount of data available after decades of research, its all there you just have to look. These are based on STATISTICS and not opinion.
no Enough is enough! So sorry for your loss.
yes Well as I understand it the wall is primarily built to stem the rotating flow of 400.000 deportations and illegal entries every year. The berlin wall and the soviet/russian border towards finland required guardtowers,minefields,troops,dogs etc to be efficient.
no YES WE NEED BUILD BORDER WALL NOW
no Eva Graham ; last post 2/18.  Comments are full if these revived, foreign, & newly created Facebook accounts to show support for propaganda and spread discord.
yes Jim Russell cuz it is not an emergency
yes Marjorie Anderson and the answer is?????????? Can YOU answer the question instead of acting like your cool aid master
no Wall? It will not do anything except create more tunneling. Focus on our infrastructure.
yes Formerly deported, but came back to Adams County PA.  https://fox43.com/2019/02/15/mexican-citizen-accused-of-raping-child-in-adams-county/
yes THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES AND IS DESTROYING AMERICA!
no Im so sad to hear this.  Law-of-Destiny convicts government officials for this and many other EASILY preventable deaths.  NO EXCUSE.  Build that wall
yes Sorry to hear... if the wall is already built and we have illegal immigrants inside of the country that is not the biggest problem because it is easy to find here inside the country and easy to deport...
no Yeah... There are millions of people in the country. This is anecdotal
yes Obviously truth
no You idioits actually believe itll work lol
yes 1976 Creation of NEA 2001 9/11 2009 Swine Flu epidemic 2019 $$ for  Wall. Which one isnt an emergency?
yes Your statistic doesn't hold any proof... especially if you live in El Paso, Tx
no Drugs still get into prisons  Prisons have walls
no God bless them.
no Build the WALL
yes https://www.wikihow.com/Survive-in-Federal-Prison
yes Getting rid of you will keep us safer than anything!
yes ****"Simply What I See From These We MUST COMPLETE THE WALL....!!!! :) " ****  ****"May The Triple Gems Bless You All....!!!! :) " ****  ****"Our Jesus Bless You All....!!!! :) " ****
no Larry Lubiner it's already happening... might as well get on this Trump train ole son TRUMP 2020 because you aren't going to have any Democrap presidents for the next 100 years
no Guns don't kill people, Democrats Do
yes Marilyn Carter there you go again. I rest my case.
yes Mr President Donald J. Trump Vice President Mike Pence can you investigate this: California's Cash Crop of Harvested Votes in Midterm & Other Liberal Cra... https://youtu.be/V2_hDCB1b0M
yes John Fahrer vets will get help from the billions we spend every year on handouts to illegals.
no there are people in this world that wont agree unless it happens to them.. that's baffling to me.
no Teresa Pagniano there will still be "junk" brought in.
yes John N Karen Morris  I copied this thank you for posting it! Very good information!
yes We need the wall to help those doing a very good job to protect we the people it would make their job not so difficult.
yes Yes democrats killing babies and illegal killing young American
yes Walls work! I live by the border lets create a safer GREATER AMERICA!!!
yes Reason why President Trump won election. Making America Great Again...Building the wall to keep us safe....Democrats Political Power Issue against Trump...well NancyPelosi  Tear down your security Cameras Fences Walls Doors Windows to your home and see how safe you feel....President Trump has accomplished more than any President in office....Make Certain Nancy Pelosi and her Democrand are on the other side of the wall....
yes South Korean communist fake president Moon Jae - in tries to control the online use of South Koreans. I can not advise Trump if the sns are controlled.  South Korea 's fake President Moon Jae - in must be punished like Hussein of Iraq.
yes What about the thousands who have been brutally murdered by Americans who never should have been allowed a gun in the first place?? Gun reform works.
no Hello Dave how are you
no Carol Starr mental illness? That's an act of terrorism wether you were born in USA or not , your race, religion or w.e. someone who did the same thing the guy in Vegas did is a terrorist.
yes This wall thing is such an emergency that it will immediately be followed by golf.
yes Jackie Lee Collins the majority of the prison population is minority and Hispanic, try again
no Build that wall!  Trump 2020!
yes Ask prisoners if walls work.
no Yay!
yes I with Trump
no Stupid analogy.
yes Larry Lubiner it's already begun. I bet you're one of the same over confident tools that says there was no way Trump would be President to begin with. Keep speaking in your absolute never, we'll keep laughing at your stupidity. Under the declarations he used, they can't stop them in court. So,, coming soon to a border near you, a nice big 50 ft. barrier, complete with sharpened spikes at the top
no There is going to be a second civil war the way we are going.
yes I guess it means nothing to you that when an illegal commits a murder in this country.......YES that is his focus and it should be.............
yes Keep up the good work President Trump. Thank you for donating your paychecks, so I truly can mean it when I say thank you for your service.  PS My fondest memories of NYC involved my visits to the Trump Tower.
yes I never imagined that we would literally have to fight our own government just to keep us safe .this new democrat party is out of control and they need stoped before they kill us all
no PUT UP THE WALL!!!!!!!!!!!!
yes Build that wall,
no Danny Jones with you Danny... #pleasegiveusastrongleaderlikeTrump
yes Dante Noel you are the one that needs help!
yes How about all the other drunk drivers who are American losers? I understand that you are hurting but the Wall is not immigration policy.
yes How about the killings in Illinois yesterday? Would a wall have prevented that? Would a wall have prevented the shootings in Parkland? In Aurora?
yes I submit that things consistently being uncontrollable at the border for so many years proves that the only way to actually gain control over it IS to declare it a national emergency. It's clear just trying to legislate activity hasn't done anything substantial.  If alcohol is negatively impacting your liver and you continue to drink doesn't that call for stronger measures against drinking? So a doctor informs you to stop or you'll die. Yet you continue to imbibe alcohol. At what point does that become considered a health emergency? Or do you just keep hearing that you have to stop or you'll die until that actually becomes the reality. By then it's to late to respond with corrective action. ...in this case America is the "body" and drugs are killing the body. Over the years it's only getting worse. They say they will stop it with legislation but never really stop it. The addict is going to allow themselves to die and the members of the body are sort of not wanting to let that happen. Only the "brains" of the American body aren't acting in unity to get the body off drugs, away from violence and separated from corruption.
yes Fine words.......... Show Us The Proof instead of the headline ?
yes I just don't understand how American people can feel more sympathy for illegals than their own fellow Americans. Pretty sure the left is totally anti everything American :(
yes I refuse to argue with a myopic liberal moron, you will just drag me down and beat me with experience!  Illegal border jumper killers are everywhere, who knows maybe drunk in a car near you!
no I see ulot of peoples on this page talking about drunk driveers I lost my hold family from a druck driver only I live out of 4 peoples.
no sorry for your loss but we need to put the blame where blame is due to the last 5 president's promise it and never did a dam thing so I blame them  [  I THINK MR TRUMP IS SENT FROM GOD HIMSELF ]]
yes Ron O'Hearn no need to save anything for me. I don't live in the world's most  moronic country,  thankfully  ...
yes https://www.npr.org/2019/01/10/683662691/where-does-illegal-immigration-mostly-occur-heres-what-the-data-tell-us
no By the way #WhatCulture?
yes What if.   What if.     That is so stupid.   What if you're momma swallowed
yes While this is a tragic story, I can't help but wonder how many illegals kill Americans vs how many Americans kill Americans. Would be an interesting comparison to start with.
no If you want to keep us safe then have national constitutional carry.
yes We have problems at the border, I don't think anyone denies this. But 'National Emergency'? Billions of dollars going that way, when there are so many other (undeclared) 'National Emergencies' where $$$, time & energy are equally or even more important? (our infrastructure, the opioid crisis, homeless, no healthcare, our vets, etc etc etc) Each side (Democrats or Republicans) tells you only what they want you to hear & believe. Our 'job' as individuals is to listen to both sides, yet believe neither side in entirety & then to do our own research in finding the Truth. We mustn't be Sheep...being blindly led to slaughter by either party.
yes Build That Wall!!
yes Alex Cusma
yes Yes I agree
yes Why this dude head remind me of a thick booty bitch lol
yes 85% of people who come in here illegally overstay their visas. And those people are Canadians. Why don't you build a wall on the northern border, you morons?

no Seriously how many Americans kill people what kind of a stupid reason is that
yes So when is a wall going around trump tower????
yes Did someone say impeach Pelosi???
no After completing the war, we need to work on gun control Mr president
no Joseph Roy  it had to be Fox News . Realistically tho are you stupid to the point where you believe rape will end in the us after all the illegals are gone? Will there still be innocent people getting shot by police, and more innocent people getting shot by crazy Caucasians? That walls not gonna solve all these issues in America, and Im sorry if youre stupid enough to believe something like that.
yes I bet they did it with a gun...
no You want them in this country where men and women have lost their lives to protect it ? Then open your doors and homes and let them in ? No ???? Didn't think so.
no We Love u President Trump 2020
no Agree 100%. Build the wall.

yes SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS  VILE VICIOUS VINDICTIVE EVIL demonRATS  ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HER DEATH LET US NOW DESTROY THEM
no These killers ...They are not illegal immigrants, they are illegal aliens, with no business being here in the USA,.. before I applied to become a citizen... I was a legal immigrant ( 10 year wait)  then I was classified as a resident alien ( 8 year wait) , then finally I took the citizenship exam & became a naturalized citizen. We must allow #45 to complete the border wall.
yes Curtis Rice your a jerk
yes We were hit from behind while on the way to work. The driver of the other car, an older white woman, pulled up beside us and shouted that she was going to pull off to the side of the road. Then she turned off her lights so we couldn't see her license plate, and drove off. Our car was destroyed, and I required medical attention, and she just left us there. Another time an older white woman wrecked our car, and hers, by making a left turn from the right lane without looking. She then, unsuccessfully, tried to convince the police it was our fault. Another older white woman backed into my car in a parkinglot, denting in the front and breaking my headlight. Despite doing this in front of a police officer, she hit the gas and sped off. When they caught her we discovered she didn't have insurance. Once, when driving a work truck on the interstate, an older white man became enraged because I wasn't driving fast enough in the fast lane. I had to be in that lane because my exit was coming up off of it, and I had to slow down to 60 because my truck wouldn't have made the turn otherwise. He sped up, cut in front of me, and slammed on his breaks. Somehow I managed to stop in time. If my truck hadn't been empty, I would have certainly hit him, and we both could have been killed. I have never had an unpleasant encounter of any kind with an immigrant, legal or otherwise. Middle-aged white people are another story.
no says the american from the UAE hahahahaha
no Build the Wall. Keep America Safe. Thank you President Trump!!
yes People lives with no border is safe for new world
no God bless Donald Trump.
no As long as it isn't your family who is dead, right?! As long as it hasn't cost you personally, yet!  It isn't a competition ffs! Illegal border jumpers are not supposed to be here, FULL STOP! Between the ACA and these illegals flooding our ERs and hospitals for FREE, my 36 year old daughter is dead, how are your kiddos?!
no If we still had investigative journalists, it would be pretty easy for them to track this down.. law enforcement still cooperates between American and Mexico.
yes I know we're ALL terrified
no Annette Keller I used to drive for a living, and spent a lot of hours on the road. I'm sure the people who crashed into me had their side of the story, but the police who investigated agreed with my side. If you can tell me how it was my fault a woman ran into the back of me while I was at a red light, I'd be glad to listen. What do I know, maybe turned off her lights and sped off away from the scene because she had to use the bathroom really bad. Innocent people do that all the time.
no #Protection for American families is my highest priority. Walls work and will keep us safe! #DonaldTrumpBestPresidentUSForever
yes So you shut down the government and forced hardship onto over a million Americans when you could've just declared this 'emergency' then?
no Emily Neal Americans will never go for it. They are smart enough to know that only the law abiding will turn in guns, leaving them completely defenseless against criminals.
no Build the Wall!!!!!!
yes please get Donald Jr. off the campaign   trail,,,,,,,OMG
yes Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin 4) American Optimism   ~Small business optimism has hit historic highs.  ~NFIBs small business optimism index broke a 35 year-old record in August.  ~Evwn leftist SurveyMonkey/CNBCs small business confidence survey for Q3 of 2018 matched its all-time high.  ~Manufacturers are more confident than ever. 95 percent of U.S. manufacturers are optimistic about the future, the highest ever.  ~Consumer confidence is at an 18-year high. 12 percent of Americans rate the economy as the most significant problem facing our country, the lowest level on record.  ~Confidence in the economy is near a two-decade high, with 51 percent rating the economy as good or excellent.
yes Places that have the strictest gun control measures have the most gun violence making it harder for law abiding citizens to have guns while criminals continue to get them however they please makes zero sense! It makes people less safer!
yes https://www.facebook.com/TheOther98/photos/a.115969958413991/2503185179692445/?type=3&theater
yes Jeff Sterup  I'm so sick of liberal stupidity.  Crime is a state issue.  This is a federal issue since it has to do with illegal immigration.   Stop voting Democrat, and your state will fair better.  Also, go back to school and educate yourself on state and federal issues.  You must have skipped government classes.
yes Oh I can yes. But if we're an illegal who starts his own business and hires other illegals.... Or if you are a home owner looking for cheap labor because your don't make the most money in the the world. Then you hire a guy of Mexican decent but he speaks good English. Only to find his "work" is shabby at best and that that man is not even legally here....
yes Sounds exactly like, "An armed man killed my daughter. Democrats are right - we need gun control." Both the left and right use horrific incidents to justify their policy proposals. We cannot let anger and emotion drive our political discourse.
yes Yes build the wall
yes Conservatives- DoNt PoLiTiCizE gUn DeAtHs, sTuPiD DeMs  Also Conservatives- Politicize deaths at the hands of illegal immigrants.   UPDATE- You are just as dead if you're killed by an illegal immigrant as you are by a legal citizen. Only difference is, more people are killed by legal citizens every year than illegals lol. BaN uS cItIzEns!!
yes https://m.sandiegoreader.com/news/2011/jan/27/blogs-toni-atkins-developer-dollars/
yes California
yes build the wall for get the dumocrat.
yes Danny Jones we need our own Donald Trump! Hes the greatest President of all time
no or you for defending him?
yes Thank You for All The Hurt You Put Up With Mr President
no Anthony Clark go drink some more Flint water
no If you have open borders you know longer have a border!!!! I agree with Trump 100%.
no Trump is genius
no https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/284
no Israel has a BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL around it and it obviously works. Google "Israel barrier" under Google images.
yes Paul Seldes how many children die daily at the hands of democrats allowing abortion...
yes CliffandKim Ferrell That is RIGHT!  Trump 2020!
no So sorry for youre loss Build the wall
yes Boss congratulations for your presedent day I wish all the best for you and your family
yes You have my condolences sir
yes Adrianna Anders are Democrats taking money from the drug cartels politicians all see motivated by money over the best interest for Americans ,their position has no logic,with More than 70,200 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2017, including illicit drugs and prescription opioidsa 2-fold increase in a decade. ... Drug overdose deaths rose from 16,849 in 1999 to 70,237 in 2017. The bars are overlaid by lines showing the number of deaths by gender from 1999 to 2017 (Source: CDC WONDER).
no Larry Lubiner What a stupid question, totally unrelated to the wall issue.  Did existing strict gun laws? Did Democrats or liberals?  Did the city government, or the state?
yes Only reason Obama was in office is cuz he was voted in illegally & Democrat knows it. He's anti-American & has been raised that way
yes I'm so sorry for your lost!!  I know words aren't enough when you've lost a love one!!
yes Then do Mandatory E-verifying if it is
yes Very sorry and ashamed that this happened. This shouid never happen to an American Citizen. Our Congress especially the Democrats are betraying Americans. Muslims should not be in America or holding any kind of Offices either . Many Red flags from Congress going off that American Citizens must be aware of and have strong awareness that betrayal is happening Big time. We need to fully support President Trump, because Congress is against us.
yes We have four National Emergencies. Climate Change, Fake Elections, Guns and a Lying Traitorous president.
yes sometimes by the wisdom of force
no While these are heartbreaking stories the fact that the driver was in the country illegally has nothing to do with the traffic accident, the driver ran a red light because he was drunk
no Id be happy to respond Debi but you are a coward and blocked me so I dont know what you said.
yes I support securing our border and strongly enforcing immigration laws. An undocumented immigrant does not have the legal right to be in this country, so if they commit a crime and are here illegally,  I consider that a failure of the federal goverment and our immigration system
no Dumb ass Democrats. Baby killers. Enough said.
yes Majestica Arlene that's the most illogical and uninformed spew I've read in days!
yes I support mr trump. It is a need the wall descition is great
no Heart felt prayers to all who have lost loved ones. Yes we NEED a WALL
no Take all the security away from Congress. They forget who they work for. Remind them we the people are their employers. Use their security money to  BUILD DAT WALL!!!
no Melissa Lamphere just how many is a  few bad people?
no MAGA.....remove a democrat from government.
yes Jo Sechi And your point is?
no Emily Neal omg, Google it.  It's common knowledge.   Quit being so damn lazy.  Geeze!
yes My sister had cancer once and we built a wall. Not only did it cure her cancer, but I believe it actually has cured all cancers ever since. True story. Its fake news if you hear otherwise
yes YES, BUILD THE WALL. AMERICA BE SAVE WITH THE WALL.
yes I believe in you, Mr. President.
no Eva Graham   Seriously? You have to stop drinking the Kool-Aid.  Let him open Pandora's Box. Remember, once you open Pandora's Box you can't close it.  Donald Trump. Go ahead and declare a National Emergency. One of two things will happen. Either you will lose in court. Or, the next Democratic president will declare a National Emergency for climate change, gun control, DACA, Health Care reform and middle-class tax cuts. Just to start with. 
yes Estefania Torres Restrepo so how does anyone accurately determine how many people or the amount of drugs have came into the US undetected?  That's right, you can't.  The argument of most/majority and legal ports of entry is just guesswork trying to be passed off as fact. A wall is a deterrent, along with the increased border enhancements.  They go hand in hand in preventing the illegal crossing of the border.  Come in legally, they are more than welcome.  Come in  illegally, no.   Opinions are not facts.
yes Fight the good fight build that wall, Sir
no Did you know there are shovels in Mexico? https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-01-18/nearly-400-migrants-tunnel-under-border-wall-to-enter-united-states-from-mexico
yes Mr. President, Americans cannot only be protected by building wall between America and Mexico. There are other means through which this can be done. Stop putting pressure on public purse
yes FINISH THE WALL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
no And hundreds of other children have been killed by fellow Americans so what is the real crisis here.
yes Piper Tunno the shooters are either dead or in prison.  We have criminal citizens who are punished. We dont need to add illegal criminals from other countries to the ones we already have.
no Neil Wiseman  And who's showing their ignorance, lying about our President.
yes Amen, more killings by illegals, than we have been told.
yes Jeanie Railsback  Al-Bashir is killing the unarmed demonstrators by live bullets Al-Bashir is a dictatorship that oppresses people in satellite channels. The uniform is owned in Sudan. Bashir is holding people in detention camps until death. Join us in the intifada to gain our
yes They are the mulattos from the great abysmal swamp in North Carolina and Virginia that we freed in 1865.  This is their country.
yes Thank you President Trump for keeping us safe!
yes So sorry that happened! It never should have happened!
yes Thank you Mr. President
yes Abel da Silva the band or the state of being?
yes Ron O'Hearn but where's the exaggeration and fear mongering?
no Lynn Limauro Floyd what does the wall have to do with it?
yes What else is there?  They talk about security.  Obama did.  Other Democrats do.  But the sanctuary cities and stupid laws for their protection just make things worse.  They are all talk.  A wall will work.  It wont keep everyone out, of course. But it will keep many out.  And until they show other REAL ideas, I want a wall.  I have been jumped by illegals.  I was very lucky.  Protect AMERICANS, not illegals
yes Why is Trump sharing an article from one of the "fake news" mainstream media?
yes So much good will come from building the wall. Trump 2020.
no Reread my comment, good Lord.
no Build the Wall!
yes CliffandKim Ferrell dont you wonder how many of the trolls on this page are actually illegal themselves??
yes Thank you, President Trump for putting America first.
no Some of you people are painfully dumb.. Go live elsewhere if you don't like what Trump is doing
yes Cindy Sak Nowak so you believe that when the government has shootouts with people that refuse to give up their rights because the illegal firearms owners aren't going to obey the law then everything gets better. You are to damn dumb. You say Chicago laws aren't strict enough yet open carry cities are some of he safest in the country.
no BUILD THE WALL!!!
yes Yet nothing about the 30,000 plus gun deaths caused by American citizens every year. 
yes Crisis actors
yes Katie Vigna Some of us love our country, Katie...you clearly don't.
yes ...they won't do anything...i know many who are here and working illegally...i know one that was pulled over for speeding, had no license, speaks very little english, the cop gave her a warning for both violations...
yes Build that wall President Trump!
yes If youre going to build a wall on the border with Mexico, wouldnt you also build walls on both coasts and our border with Canada? And if you do that, wouldnt make sense just to isolate ourselves from the world, cease all trade and just curl up into a ball and ignore the realities of life? LOL at the WALL. #SmokeAndMirrors
yes What about all the people that have been killed by Americans?  Like the five killed in Aurora yesterday?  Dont they count?
no So sad.  Build the wall as big as possible!
no Play Video
yes F the wall!
no Jimm Jenkens your right. And the founding fathers made sure we would have the right to bare arms in the future with the 2nd amendment.  That's so we can defend ourselves from those that would do us harm and the socialist government that is trying to arbitrate a coup against our duly elected government
yes My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no drivers license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputys car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL
no Sharon Fantana run at it full bore , you'll get your answer
yes What about the Americans killing Americans? Never mention anything about that!!
yes I cant wait until the next president  a Democrat  calls a national  emergency  for the health care crisis in the USA. Finally something  will get done to help the American  people. Thank you President  Trump for setting the precedent.  And, oh by the way the next Democrat  president  will  also be able to declare a national  emergency  and ban guns that kill people when there is the next school  shooting.  Thank you again president  Trump for making  America great again! You alone have changed America  forever
no We have to build it first, to see if it works.
no MAGA! Mr Trump 2020
yes Veronica:  You are a liar. You have never been to London and that didnt happen.
yes Democrats only want your vote, not your safety. BUILD THE WALL.
yes So many lives tragically lost... LAW'S work if they're inforced. Secure our Border's Mr. President. BUILD THE WALL
no The Department of Defense pegs U.S. casualties in Iraq at 4,491 and Afghanistan at 2,356 for a total of 6,847 lost servicemen during the two wars.  Rep Steve King (R-IA), one of the most ardent immigration hawks in Congress, pegs that the numer of americans killed by illegal aliens in the same two years as the war, comes out to roughly 4,380 per year. A Thats a big problem
yes Build the Wall!!!
no As Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, Trump can drain the entire $30 billion from the Pentagon, National Guard, Coast Guard, Space Force, and the military budgets to complete the entire wall for his 'national crisis' in less than 2 years.
no AMEN!  RIP.
no Brett Gibson awwww does he hurt your feelings???
yes Eddie Gonzalez poor me? Your sarcasm shows your intelligence, and that you have none. Im advocating for families who lost their loved ones, not myself. I was lucky to just come out alive with only injuries.
yes Kathy Smith Williams depends who the next president is walls have been taken down before.
yes That's simply silliness. How many white, males have killed, maimed, tortured other U.S. citizens? Can we deport them too? No, we build prison walls and once they are released or escape or die, we consider it justice served. We don't blame the entire white, male race, do we? This is simply another example of you race hating.
yes Stupidest. President. Ever. Mueller is Coming! And almost all of the pro-trump posters here are fake accounts, also known as russian bots.
yes Joseph Bernadzikowski did you like what Obama did... did you live somewhere else
no Build that wall ,prayers
yes I have a wall around my property. Keeps out everybody.

yes Katy Chavez yeah sis because mexicans are the ones illegally crossing the boarder  yall stay on your own fuckin side and it wouldnt be a problem to begin with. duh
yes Always President Donald Trump and Melania first lady God bless.  The wall will be build.
no Jim Butkowsky I guess you won't be saying that if it was your family
no Kris Landers so those who befriend or stand behind illegals are to blame for illegals actions? I like that idea.
no You sound like a 4 year old!
yes So sorry for your loss sir . We stand behind you and we mourn with you
no Because of the wall you might killer her and blame immigrants I think you have also forgot that your wore a immigrant in USA
yes But Americans kill Americans all day everyday and no one seems to care about that

yes All 55 miles   So much winning, Im not happy!   Be best, trolls
no Maria Nichols you ever get tired of being a loser?
yes President Trump is correct and this gentleman has suffered a great loss.  He knows first hand that a Wall will help.  May his daughter R.I.P. I am very sorry the loss of your child.
yes He not come to politics just to help you, idiot. He has his own plan for himself and his friends.
no Anthony Witcombe ok

yes Wall wall wall .yes..
yes What about the senseless killing in Illinois by someone who had a gun and shouldn't have, the children in so many schools killed senselessly.  Tragic.  Yet nothing done about that.
no Danny Jones Definitely, a troll!
yes How about the kids dying from mass shootings? What about them?
no I support wall 100% for drugs dillers
yes Put walls around this clown
no Was this dude illegal or any of the mass shooters in the past 10 years for that matter? https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/02/15/5-dead-in-aurora-workplace-shooting/
yes Kelly Anders hopefully you realize that not all illegal immigrants are brown.  Also, what does being gay have to do with your fear of white men?  I probably don't understand the issues you face because #1 I'm straight and #2 a person's life choices, sexuality, political affiliation, skin color, etc aren't really things I think about when I meet someone or pass them on the street.  My first impression of people is usually based on whether they are polite and pleasant or have a chip on their shoulder and a crappy attitude.  Other than that, I personally don't go throughout my daily life in fear of much.  I do believe that illegal immigration is a problem in the United States.
yes Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin  3) American Income   ~Median household income rose to $61,372 in 2017, a post-recession high.  ~Wages up in August by their fastest rate since June 2009.  ~Paychecks rose by 3.3 percent between 2016 and 2017, the most in a decade.  ~Council of Economic Advisers found that real wage compensation has grown by 1.4 percent over the past year.  ~Some 3.9 million Americans off food stamps since the election.  ~Median income for Hispanic-Americans rose by 3.7 percent and surpassed $50,000 for the first time ever in history. Home-ownership among Hispanics is at the highest rate in nearly a decade. Poverty rates for African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans have reached their lowest levels ever recorded.
yes Deb Shriver try 54 million, not 4 million.
yes You show me in the Constitution where it states you can not use money to protect the US citizens
no Immigrants killed thousands of my people. Thanks, pilgrims.
yes My Heart goes out to the Family.
yes https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States
yes Comparing people to dogs... seriously?
yes Mike Mandel that was in his initial package that Nancy said no to.  Geeze, dont you people ever pay attention?
yes Sorry about your son
no Justin Fox so we dont need a wall   Feds bring drugs into this country too
yes BUILD OUR WALL - WALLS WORK - KEEP AMERICA SAFE & MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !!
no Please make an executive order to change the name of our country to Mexico, to fulfill your prophecy that Mexico will pay for the wall.
yes What is disgusting is that You can't accept the truth more reality
yes Maureen Hersey Brown get your asses out of other countries and then talk.  The sad part about it is.  A white man would kill you quicker if you took your front door off.  I guess you whites think your god fearing righteous citizens.  Don't make me laugh.  Look at who have been the serial killers, all white.
yes If the wall is as big as this man's forehead I can sleep well at night
yes Illegal immigrants coming here to destroy Americans & turn this country into a 3rd world country with the help and support of UN American Democrats !!
yes USA has killed most people over the world how many Americans cross borders to take advantage of child prostitution and so much to list here that not counting asholes
yes Claiming 7 ??. You have no idea what you are talking about
no Compile a list of people who would be STILL ALIVE today and send it to the court 9th and way they want to start  killing babys     Dam  wat these blood thirsty  dem up to . I see a great March coming
yes Wall wall wall Trump fart you will be buried under southern walls stop crying wall wall
no Too bad that the unholy demoncrats could dare less.
no Donna Williford Burger - Donna/ all these people who dont think the wall is necessary- I have a perfect way to change their minds.... delete  President Trump   Insert  President Hillary Clinton
yes Many States have a 2x - 3rd jail. It helps until someone gets out. It's an addiction and needs treated as such. But it takes like all addictions. The addict has to work hard at staying sober for life. It's a decision with prayers. Illegals need to stay out of America period. They should be tried for murder ..
no What are we doing about all the mass shootings? This is a scare tactic. Give border patrol what they want. This wall has become a huge distraction.
yes If they didn't work..Nancy and Chuck wouldn't have them around their property
yes Ah, why is it that every time I discuss anything. Every right winger brings up "black on black crime in chicago". Do you even know the circumstances leading up to the massive crime in that area? Do you know the history? Because it starts with right wing policies. Since gun control measures in Chicage, crime has seen a steady decrease yearly. So we started there. What's your point? Is a wall going to keep you safe, definitely not. Not when the major terrorists in this nation are home-grown of the white right wing variety.
yes America first! Trump 2020!
yes Hichem snitches get stitches
yes  Please, where ever youre coming from, come to the USA legally.
yes You are so right. God Bless your daughter.
no I've never hired an illegal, I wonder how many thousands Don the Con has hired?????
yes Hopefully Gov. you won't wind up with the blood of the good people of California on your own hands.
yes Alberto Weisz
no So sorry for your loss. These idiots who turn their heads and pretend not to hear or see what is going on because see they haven't had a loved one killed by an illegal are fooling themselves if they think they are going to remain safe if this situation isnt dealt with. I stand with our president, and I stand with all who have lost a loved one because the Democrats refuse to help support the wall.
yes So sad build the wall and throw the democrats over it
no Agree.  Was just at the border to drop off family at PCT start. And it was crazy to see the wall there in person.  Down by Campo CA.  We need the Border protected. Thank you for fighting the good fight for all of us that agree with you.
yes Yet thousands of times more americans killed by home grown terrorists and donnie does nothing... blame the immigrants but the statistics do not support.
yes BEST PRESIDENT EVER!!!!!!
yes Michala Dotson were not talking about immigrants, were talking about ILLEGAL aliens. There IS a difference.
no #buildthewall
yes i'm tired of the hypocritical BS coming from the left. Just build the freaking wall already. get it done. it's been labeled as a crisis for 30 years, primarily by democrats. but not today. stand your ground Mr. President!
no Patti Cullen stfu go chase cars ugly
yes Edgar D. GutierrezTexas is the only state to track crime specifically among illegal immigrants let's use them as an example:  Between January 2011- January 2019 there have been 10 school shootings in the state of Texas. Of those 10 shootings 15 people have died and 28 have been injured.   Now let's look at crime amongst illegal immigrants in Texas. "Between June 1, 2011 and January 31, 2019, 189,000 illegal aliens were charged with more than 295,000 criminal offenses. DPS criminal history records reflect those criminal charges have thus far resulted in over 120,000 convictions including 238 HOMICIDE convictions; 13,662 assault convictions; 3,158 burglary convictions; 17,930 drug convictions; 175 kidnapping convictions; 7,100 theft convictions; 11,336 obstructing police convictions; 1,013 robbery convictions; 1,710 sexual assault convictions; 1,153 sexual offense convictions; and 1,282 weapon convictions."  That's just one state.
yes Someone stole one of my favorite dogs. Sometimes I'm really pissed off. Other days I'm sad.  I miss my dog.
yes Lisa Mann Mr. Trump will not be President forever but the wall will.
yes Build that wall!  So sorry for your loss, heartbreaking!
yes I know 500 people who were shot almost killed in Vegas.... Anything being done about that?  Your promise that Mexico will pay for it died yesterday
no Please help America President Trump!
no I'm sorry for the loss of life due to illegal aliens but how many death from homegrown players deaths from no insurance or drugs to save them America is broke and istead of fixing it we are building a wall
no BC:  Nope, try again low output person  https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2016/11/29/another-clinton-trump-divide-high-output-america-vs-low-output-america/  I live in NYC, we dont need Amazon, but funny how they wanted to come to our liberal bubble

yes Please please please build that Wall Mr Trump
yes barbara your full of crap!
no But nothing at all has been done about the dozens of white men/citizens who have been involved in mass shootings over many years in this country. Schools, malls, concerts. How about you address that?!!!
no Michael Thompson if that's the case let's ban guns. It will save a life , right cons?
yes So sorry,, so so sorry.  It shouldve never happened.  This problem shouldve never existed.  Nothing will ever replace what youve lost. Really hate the pain you must go through every single day.  And to hear politicians act like theres not a problem has to add to your broken heart.  
yes H sorry for you loss and im sorry for all ofthe victis of gun vioence,  walls wont  work,
no A crooked cop killed my friends brother.

no Gabriel Son what would you like for Christmas?
yes First off.. they are Americans..
yes walls work. Stop being petty or take your doors off and let everyone in your house. Hahahaha
no Thank you Mr President for keeping us safe
yes Maybe when the car companies were poisoning the "well," all those politicians that they bought (both Democrat and Republican) voted against regulating them, so now the water in Flint, Michigan is as disaster.  As for "spending money on I th her things," isn't that the point?  Why not spend money on CV leaning up the water in Flint rather than spending on other things?
no Lynn Limauro Floyd So sad! God bless you! Illegal's need to be vetted! Build that WALL!
no That's why with the wall comes tech and other strategies, but it starts with a wall.  Ex...my house has a fence, door, locks, alarm system, guns.  It starts with a fence.
yes I don't understand why there is so much resistance from the democratic party, I guess they need to lose a loved one themselves to know what It feels like.
yes God bless you Mr. President Donald J. Trump and your family
yes Maaaaaaan yall stupid if you think a wall ganna stop immigrants im laying here with 5 of my cousins who climed over it  just 2 days ago
no My son was killed by a drunk driver also. That man was from Long Island New York. Should we put a wall there too? Odds are in the years both of us lost our kids to drunk drivers the majority of them were born & raised in the USA. Does one death matter less because of the who or where they were from?  Yes laws need to be enforced all the way around but especially on the employers that hire undocumented workers.Something so many neglect to mention or enforce. Seems even Trump branded businesses like to hire the undocumented.  Not sure a wall in the middle of the desert would make much of a difference. Ports of entry, towns, cities is different.  Everyone agrees something needs to be done just some of us see the wall as a waste of money from a man that promised Mexico would pay for it. Maybe use fines imposed on businesses that use undocumented labor illegally to pay for a wall where it would be most effective.
no Nazi much? Good grief
no I'm so sorry for the loss of your lovely daughter. We lost a daughter three and a half years ago. She was 25. I am so sorry for you.
no Sorry for your loss! Build the wall!
yes Take the money from El Capo and get it built!  Thanks
no Build that wall America first
no Yes walls work.
yes You helped kill the economy in Atlantic City can we build a wall around your ignorance?
no Lee Mcclelland so we shouldn't have a wall to make it easier for them?
yes Git er done and God bless America!
yes No more murdered Americans
yes A drunk driver killed my friend, we must ban all alcohol. Vaccines hurt my loved one, we must ban all vaccines. A gun man killed my child we must ban all guns. See how none of these are good arguments.
yes Joseph Nowik which will be declared illegal and unconstitutional,  it by that time the wall is built.... the man is a genius....checkmate!!
no I support the wall completely!
no KEEP AMERICA GREAT 2020 Re-elect President Donald J. Trump.
no Build the wall now
no https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/videos/324555401528107/
yes Albert J Destefanis  He May not even get a second term. HAHAHA!
yes I want to report the parents of that kid in your profile pic for neglect. What number do I call? No one should have to grow up with such ignorant parents
yes https://scontent-ort2-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/42743601_1965638283458054_6855950767258337280_n.jpg?_nc_cat=1&_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-2.xx&oh=7109e70aace4b7f3d7dcf041f223dffb&oe=5D26AB43
yes Yes thanks for everything. U.S is great and continueing.
yes We love you president Trump  Best president ever
yes Shame is not in thier vocabulary. I support the wall all the way.
yes Danny Jones it won't matter. Within one more generation the Muslims will have bred themselves into a majority in the UK, and your "culture" will be gone forever anyway.
yes God Bless and protect you, Mr. President. Don't give up the fight...we're with you!
yes Ppl from Chicago come to my town and shoot up the place all the time...should we make a wall for Chicago?
no . Thank you President Trump
no 41 year low.....
no #ImmigrationReform
no These stories are heartbreakingly sad! Bless them in their grief! Build this wall now and secure our nation! Remove all incentives for illegals to come here now!
yes How about the drugs that are made here in the United states that are killing people
yes Trump saying the truth
yes Send me a pic Jason Ward.  I am interested in seeing this WALL thats being built for a month.
no Wheres the data for this? I dont believe your statement.   Let me tell you a story. Someone wants to shoot a big bunch of kids, so they walk into a gun shop, get an semi-automatic gun straight away and goes and shoots up a school. This is the problem.   The solution: the same person wants to shoot a big bunch of kids, they go into a gun shop, background checks are required and then a waiting period. Background check finds the person with multiple mental health/violence issues and are not allowed a gun. Person can not shoot up a school and overtime thousands of lives are saved.
yes Thank you Mr. President for all youre doing
yes Thank you Ms. President for all what you are doing to protect us and make America great again God Bless you and all your Family praying for you always
yes Wall ain't going stop them from coming over hell what are you going to do with the ones that are already over here? nothing exactly
no Keep on Trumpin
yes The Left Wing Liberal Democrats are trying to destroy this Country. America is so fed up with all their bullshit.
yes Stay in Germany, Emil....
no Melissa Ann democrats and a few uncomparable Republicans. Our Presidents got this..
yes George Brakey Why do you think that most of these mass shotters go to no gun zones such as schools and work sweetie!
yes What about overpopulation and the population of foster/adoption facilities/systems? What about the Christians that are pro-life until the child is born then turn their nose up at it and tout "It's your responsibility." Etc.
no WE SURPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP
yes 5 people were killed in Aurora yesterday, NOTHING HAPPENS. 1 white woman gets killed by an immigrant? CLOSE THE BORDERS, HAMBERDER MAN SAYS IT'S AN EMERGENCY!!!!
yes Here in Germany we have thousands illegal migrants... Its not nice, because every day you can read, that resident people killed by knife - attacks. Its Not a Problem to come to Germany from Africa or middleeast states without your papers. Its a disaster. If i have the Chance to live in the United States, i will take it! God bless America!
yes Let's not forget the attempt on Trump's life
yes Renieri Ortiz Illegals aren't immigrants you absolute fool.
yes Democrats don't care how many American citizens are murdered. Only worried about illegals who shouldn't be here in the first place but will somehow vote for them...smdh
yes Charles Landry I don't see any problems being fixed. Bridges clean water sensible gun laws. Seeking asylum is legal. Most are running from violence on their own country..
yes Build the wall, please!!!
yes The hurt will never go away....
yes An American citizen murdered innocent people, and shot police officers in Aurora.  Would a wall have prevented that?
yes Maybe Trump should have thought before signing that awful budget bill...
yes FACT: Net immigration has been declining for the last several years.
no 10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
yes So very sorry for your loss.     It should of never happened.   God bless you.    My prayers are with you
no Please, someone sue the legislators that protect these illegal.aliend.   sue them hard.  As hard as you can.........
yes No wander they want more and more control it's for our own benefit
yes thank you sir for all you endure for us...
yes THE BEUTIFUL WALL IS ALREADY BEING BUILT GOD BLESS THE GREAT PRESIDENT TRUMP.

no They have no right to be alive
no no what is petty it you not understanding that this child wass taken by someone who shouldn't have been here in the first place.  so don't say it is an illegal thing when that is who killed there child.  see if you can get the congress or senate to pass a stiff law for anyone drinking and driving it won't happen cause they are the ones who are doing it all the time and walk away.  don't blame this parent =
no True we need the wall n sorry for your  loss God give you strength

yes Of course we care. But some of us seem better informed and know that fentanyl is flying in from China and that most drugs are intercepted at legal entry points. Trump is lying.
no Florida school gun man is an American
no Wasn't it Crazy Queen Polosi who said "there will be collateral damage, just the way it is?" We Americans better wakeup...last chance we have! Build the wall and take control of our country! Thank you President Trump
no keep up with the times , we enforce the laws and prosocute them.do some research . we have gun control.but we wont tolerate a gun ban
no My condolences but if one black guy had done it, would you call for the arrest of every black man in America? or even their return to Africa?
no Jerika Durrett air head bimbo.
no Anthony Clark wondering why Obama didn't fix it
no Maida Broadbent Williams TROLL
yes BUILD A WALL.  IN NEW MEXICO TOO AS WE ARE DESPERATE TO STOP DRUGS AND VIOLENCE
yes Tyler Dougherty so the same sense would be made for a wall??
yes Right, because we make policy based on people's stories, not science and actual statistics.
yes Said the NRA. #WORSTPRESIDENTEVER
yes Raise the cost of the "work in America visa" . Then you can say Mexico paid for it.
no Kathy Zimmerman Blackwelder lets pray too for the families who have lost loved ones by americans killers. President Trump needs to build the wall. After that, lets see what is he going to do with all the murders of this side of the wall.
no A American citizen killed my brother so how good is your wall when they are killer in America also
yes Would it only be illegal immigrants that would ransack his house? because no Americans would ever commit a crime  moron
yes Margo H Izabal https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/27/nyregion/trump-tower-illegal-immigrant-workers-union-settlement.html
yes Valerie Siggson idiot
yes My husband and I were in a terrible reck in 2013.An illegal immigrant almost killed me and my husband. He was 17 didnt have a license was driving someone elses car. Was going 80 in a 30 miles zone. Before he hit us he passed a car with a family that had 3 little kids in the car. That could had very well killed them Thank god he didnt and my husband had to be cut out of the car. He was drunk on top of that. Didnt spend one night in jail. My husband was I c u for 14 days had too have emergency surgery on his neck and back. This is a man that has never had a broken bone in his body or stitches either. Until that night he still isnt the same till this day. So yes Im all for the wall percent. We need a president like Trump he is the one that can get the job done.
yes Individual 1 exploits these families to fit his narrative. We have walls 650 miles of them. #Donthecon
no raise your hand if you believe a wall would have stopped 9/11!!!
yes Apple, I'm sorry this happened to you, and my thoughts and prayers are with you. I hope you're doing better now. God bless.
yes Hal Bannasch those walls are to keep people in and not out...also, there are guards with guns to shoot the ones trying to escape
yes Tess Marquardt again answer  the question.  People go over and under,  what is wrong with modern technology? Instead of a beautiful  black vanity wall? What is the matter with you??????
yes Has Trump even mentioned the shooting this week of 5 people by Another American  who should not have had a gun. Nothing to do with the southern boarder again.  This post is one immigrant story which is now very old. Add up the amount of Americans our own Americans have killed in mass shootings!The emergency is new gun laws!!! And as for drugs, Americans buy it, sell it and use and will do anything to get it into the US. Most of it coming into ports of call on the east and west coasts. We have drug problems because we want drugs.!
yes Working hard at lying to the American people.
yes If the border wall would work I'd be all for it. But it doesn't. It won't.
yes Sympathies to the family but the odds of her being killed by a mass shooter in school, or by a drunk American are statistically higher than what happened here.   The courts failed long before he got to her.   There is nothing in these articles that say why he was illegal, just that he was suspected of being illegal.  Did he overstay a visa?  Is he a DACA kid?    Too many unknowns.
yes Both partys want the wall ,Just dont want Trump to succeed.
no January 2017 - Trump inaugurated - GOP majorities in both houses of Congress January 2017 Wall not an emergency February 2017 Wall not an emergency March 2017 Wall not an emergency April 2017 Wall not an emergency May 2017 Wall not an emergency June 2017 Wall not an emergency July 2017 Wall not an emergency August 2017 Wall not an emergency September 2017 Wall not an emergency October 2017 Wall not an emergency November 2017 Wall not an emergency December 2017 Wall not an emergency January 2018 Wall not an emergency February 2018 Wall not an emergency March 2018 Wall not an emergency April 2018 Wall not an emergency May 2018 Wall not an emergency June 2018 Wall not an emergency July 2018 Wall not an emergency August 2018 Wall not an emergency September 2018 Wall not an emergency October 2018 Wall not an emergency November 2018 Wall not an emergencyo November 2018 Democratic majority elected in House January 2019  EMERGENCY  Fact: Border apprehensions are at a 45 year low.  There is no crisis at our border. It's fake news.
yes Check out this Https://youtu.be/2uiPpj1t2lc
no Not everybody's going to jump on here and say their family member was killed by illegal just to get attention
yes And how many illegals would you want in your house without your permission?!
yes A 60-high foot wall that spans 1/6 of the border is equal to a door being open? You people are beyond insane. Not to mention he's never going to get it. He's going to be stuck in the courts for years.
yes Jeremy Harbolt how dogist!
no Dave Sienknecht Border busts, Border Patrol agents arrested five men carrying 4 foot tall backpacks with methamphetamine, cocaine and pills over the weekend near Gila Bend. This group was one of 5 groups of smugglers caught by agents in January near Gila Bend. In total, the drugs seized in the incidents was worth about $1.7 million. Customs and Border Protection
yes A wall for germany too, PLEASE :-(
yes Why does in cost $2500 out of my pocket in two weeks going to a doctor to be set up for high blood pressure medicine. I have insurance. Can you work on that one or do i need to vote democrat nrxt time. You promised and failed to deliver.
yes Trump lies for example in the sotu he said one out of three women in the caravans are molested.    The mainstream media looked into it and found trump lied.     Only 31 percent of women in the caravans were found to be molested!  Impeach trump and lock him up!
no Build the wall no matter what the Dems, Pelosi and Schumer say!!
yes #WorstPresidentEVER
no It's Mueller Time!!!!
yes Bill Johnson... trump cares only for trump ...
yes Joan Hamilton it doesn't matter why he was illegal.  The fact that he had no legal right to be here is enough!
yes Barbara Blitfield Pech Barack Obama
no 26 First graders were murdered by a white American !  No one gives a damn about guns, Why a wall?
yes Build the wall please. Talking from experience in Texas
yes We have had over 300 mass killings in this country since trumps fake presidency and none have been at the hands of immigrants!
yes So sorry for your terrible loss..
no I feel for this families, but cant comprehend how dumb dumb can use them for political purposes, a wall is not gonna stop this.
no Felicia Peden Hill your comment isnt showing up for me for some reason
yes Chris Weiss   You Fool!!!!  You may know the skin color because that's the first thing LIBERALS notice! But you have no IDEA whether they were Christian or not!!! Of course, unless you're writing a book and have researched and talked to the families, friends, churches they've attended, basically gathering evidence, facts, quotes from family members, friends, pastors of the churches these White males attended in order to write a book dealing with the mass shootings that occurred in 2017!!!   I know you're not a writer! I know you haven't researched this claim you've made of their religious background!  So why don't you SHUT UP and quit using this asinine claim to bash CHRISTIANITY!!  We have enough of that going on in our country today!!!!!
yes So he walked across the border or overstayed his visa- which is the usual MO?
yes "Everyone wants to rule the World...but you must earn it"...
no Trying to figure out who's opinion I should trust more  CIA NSA  FBI Homeland El Paso has filed a lawsuit on recent visit El Paso Gov't did not attend Trump Rally ?? , believe our Coast Guard that drugs and bad guys coming in Major Ports and tunnels or President who Thank God knows more than all the above I mentioned.  Well it's no contest !!!  The guy I voted for 2 years ago is CLUELESS and out of his element.  When presented with Real Data from his own agencies he was unable to answer reporters questions and you could see the frustration and started to babel incoherent  making up his own facts.  I can't vote for him in 2020.  I hope our GOP comes up with someone with integrity, honesty, dignity and has a healthy respect for women as well as people of color.  I got off the kool aid say 5 months after I voted for him.
yes Would love to hear those words from our leaders
no Lamphier--What is it that you want them to get??

yes ABSOLUTELY!!! And brand every illegal half a dozen spots on their body, require English to be spoken in public, and close down any business working a migrant without proper credentials.
no Thank you President Trump  for everything you do for America and the American people. You're such a great President. We are so very blessed to have you as our President.
no Jo Sechi Drugs kill more people than gun related deaths, so does vehicle drunk driving! How much of this countrys drugs come over our borders????? Over 90%!!!!! Several weeks ago tons of Fentanyl was confiscated at the border, enough to kill thousands!!!! Yes, Jo do some fact checking BUT DO it through a reputable source. My advice; Christian based news, Washington media research, call your senator's to keep informed of bills being passed!!!! STOP listening to bias propaganda, it make your debate ridulious.
yes The biggest problem in America is NOT illegal immigrants, its illiterate imbeciles, better known as TRUMP supporters
yes Margo Smith really?  Where do you get that information?  Did you know 50% of the violent crime in America is committed by 13% of the population.  That 13% ain't white.
no Shut up STUPID
yes Build the wall...NOW! Please!
yes Race baiter pos President.
yes Jennifer Yvonne Croff and your point is?
yes Christopher Thompson I think most of the opposition is because these people know it will work .
no What about the 40,000 americans killed by gun violence in 2018...
no Build the wall. MAGA
yes You did the right thing.
no America right now is under stress, it's doing so much self reflection on it's past. America has to confront those past images that occurred and must apologize to those it affected.
yes Other demo.
no Dan Burnzinsky...Thought???......Did you mean THROW???...
yes are you really that naive and behind in other current events(except for the hate trump ) that you don't know nk is in russia and chinas hip pocket?
no John N Karen Morris now thats a witch hunt... report people just cause ...
yes Deport the rednecks keep the illegals.
no A US worker allowed my disabled son to roll off of a changing table and fall onto a concrete floor.
no The Democrats lust for power is stronger than their desire to make American citizens safer.
yes Horrible !!!!!!
no Democrats and those so-called citizens who opposed the construction of a border wall will never be able to wash from their hands,  the blood of countless American killed by illegal aliens and drugs.
yes Didn't you just sign a bill giving it all away!
no The problem is when the immigrant doesn't face any charges because they are here illegally.   My uncle was killed in aurora colorado. He was hit by an illegal alien who was driving drunk without a license. The courts commuted his ENTIRE sentence so that he could be deported. So he is probably in mexico drinking beers with his friends while my aunt and cousins have no father or husband.
no Thats right ask Nancy palosi how her wall helps her , the pope and so many MORE!!!!!
no We need to build that damn wall.  Those naysayers need to actually spend some quality time helping our boarder gaurds.
yes TRUMP 2020!!! May God bless our nation, and again!
yes I miss my aunty  Too have a good day love you lori
yes Linda Durbin really hard for Americans huh? Cuz i still see ooor and homeless sleeping on our street while its winter .
yes Poland loves the US President and his wife
yes Republicans in congress have no back bone.. old withering rich men. 0 miles have been built 2 years later, but amnesty has been granted to illegals sponsoring minors. Gtfoh
no Im disabled because an illegal took a short cut across a California highway. Not even deported, 7 different I.Ds. I got nothing and hes still driving around!!!!!!!
no Yes sir build the wall
yes No they aren't Palo. Show me the data and I'll show you why you're wrong.
yes I don't believe the lies and propaganda of the Democrats. They want to hold on so tightly to their power and are willing to destroy life for  America's citizens even if it means death.  Thank you President Trump for everything. Trump 2020!
yes 6 people died in a shooting yesterday
yes An illegal immigrant killed a friend of mine.  He was driving without a license and ran a stop sign.  My friend on his motorcycle hit the side of the van and was killed instantly.  He had no license, fictitious tags, and no insurance.  his wife was pregnant with their son who will never know his father.  NJ being a SHITHOLE sanctuary state did NOTHING about it!  He was arrested and released.  Build that wall before WE THE PEOPLE START KILLING THESE ILLEGALS!
no The overwhelming majority come in legally, overstaying visas, and through legal ports of entry other then Mexico.  A wall would prevent none of that - proper legislation, which lobbyists to both sides oppose, would.
yes Madeline Maisog Theetge Im sorry to hear, sending prayers for her
no Joseph Nowik Yeah-- like when Obama bypassed Congress and gave 150 billion dollars to Iran under the cover of darkness.  He declared 13 National Emergencies, all of which are still cooking the books.  Most corrupt and overreaching President in US history.
yes Maximus Herrera what exactly?
yes Hahaha MSM hahaha
yes To everyone saying you can't blame him because of his immigration status, why not? Yes technically it happened because he was drunk but imagine if he had never even been here in the first place? I completely support immigration, if you do it legally!!
yes Wendi DelValle   Sorry for your loss. Unfortunately Donald Trump's boondoggle of a wall would not have helped.  Let him open Pandora's Box. Remember, once you open Pandora's Box you can't close it.  Donald Trump. Go ahead and declare a National Emergency. One of two things will happen. Either you will lose in court. Or, the next Democratic president will declare a National Emergency for climate change, gun control, DACA, Health Care reform and middle-class tax cuts. Just to start with. 
yes Bill Johnson   You cant be serious. Trump caring about someone else other than himself. Once Trump got elected he stopped worrying about America and its people.  He got there votes and thats all he wanted. This man isnt concerned about individual people.  Its just not in his makeup to care for anyone at all
no John Garrison lol
yes https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dont-be-fooled-by-trumps-make-believe-crisis/2019/02/15/b66adc60-3158-11e9-8ad3-9a5b113ecd3c_story.html?utm_term=.93e683936b22
yes Jackie Lee Collins More People die from drugs than guns. Stop with the gun comparisons.
yes Finish that wall!!!
no you are dog ass stupid
no Samuel Tan Yuan Han Most illegal immigrants overstay their visas.. Hows a wall gonna address that issue?
yes George Winn they offered 45 25 billion in 2018. He couldnt art of the deal that?  Come on. Hes a loser.
no President Trump,  you need to have another meeting with the press or a news reporter & say,  Youve heard me talk about border security enough and just play videos of the past presidents and current politicians who supported the wall as recently as 2015  #buildthewall #Trump2020 
yes Build the wall...
yes https://www.facebook.com/15704546335/posts/10157841510401336/
yes Francisco Jess Guerrero Ibez
no The Liberals are inhumane people!
no There are American citizens in greater numbers carrying off mass shootings. Aurora the latest. Yet youve not called a gun control emergency. Crickets on your part.   Lets be realistic. If you wanted to protect American families youd do something about mass shootings. But being beholden to the NRA I guess you cant. All youre doing is playing the i love bring scared heart strings of your supporters.  Donald J. Trump
yes Dave Callender gave me a good laugh! Bravo!
yes I really love your pictures and I will like to be a friend 413-353-4927 I will like to hear from you soon
yes Worley Michael , say that up close, not behind a pc,
no Shelva Wensel TROLL let Check your IQ  Low Minded naive Brain Limited Trumpee
yes What about the CRAZY who killed 5 people yesterday?
no Build That Wall
yes http://www.harley-davidson.tk/?m=1
yes Damn right Donald. Screw these people who have no common sense and want to see our country destroyed. They are blind and have no damn sense. Go Trump go!
yes Jennifer Yvonne Croff
yes Kris Landers hyperbole? Seriously? Its not. Also, what are you trying to say about illegals? That you shouldn't befriend them because they will rape your children? That's not very tolerant of you, is it?
yes Thank you President Trump. Keep making us safe and a better country. Dont listen to ANY of the politicians. They are all self centered.
yes Haha sheeeeep. Thousands die everyday.but if you guys want to talk about people being murdered Just look ar all those school shooting by all them cocaians kids. But no one talk about gun reform. Man trump supporter are nothing but suckers and fools.
yes 2/3rds of illegals came here legally and overstayed their visas,  how's a wall going to prevent that ?
yes Asha Artis not American but wouldnt most of your illegal immigration problems stem from a broken security system? Im guessing most of them dont walk over the border but are not caught by the checks in place. Even if they walk over the border why arent they rounded up and sent back? Is it possible that there is corruption here, why are they so easily avoiding detection? A wall wont fix issues like these, get to the core of the issue, seems like a bandaid wall wont fix this.
no This  is  a  tragedy  but  what  about  all  the  people  killed  by  drunk  American  drivers?
yes Legal immigration is also destroying this country as most people just overstay. Shut it all down
yes BUILD THE WALL....lets get started...
no Get the wall built
no Working for America, Trump2020
no So sorry to hear of your loss. Mandy looks like a  sweet, wonderful person. We all mourn your loss. I only wish liberals/democrats could grasp the meaning of "securing our borders" for the SAFETY of all American citizens.
yes if my taxes go to building a wall it better be a wall around you and your supporters. there are plenty other things that need to be fixed over and before a wall and yet you ignore them congrats you don't care about america (mexico is america btw also canada as well you are thinking of the united states families not american families) you care about yourself
yes Correct. So why wouldn't we slow down the invaders. You want to immigrate here do it the legal way. Real simple.
no What about that drumf?  Ban alcohol?
yes Patrick Dixon they arent running here from Tijuana
yes May God Let Her Rest in Peace! Please the Wall!
no God bless you!!
yes Trump neglected to say when he described what a wall could do , he said they walk around it but forgot that they tunnel under
no https://youtu.be/egav1IFr5n0
no THE IPs (Infanticide Party members) are on a roll these days.  Supporting the murder of new born babies AND refusing to live up to their Constitutional oath to DEFEND AND PROTECT USA!  Maybe, if an IP had a family member killed by an illegal they'd realize it is a CRISIS!
no My deepest condolences to those familys who have lost love ones. Build the wall! #KeepingAmericaSafeTrump2020
no Thank you for fighting for America President Trump
yes 7 FACTS about immigration.  https://www.facebook.com/142474049098533/posts/2354864591192790/
yes One angel parent is no different than another. His grief is not greater than a parent who lost a child to a mass shooting. But lets rage in the streets! Not for both. I mean, fire arms are perfectly legal so we dont really care about THOSE angel parents. And if they try to speak out, well publicly humiliate them AND their live children just for shits and giggles. But by God we will rage for the ones killed at the hands of an illegal!! Gtfo with your fake empathy and compassion.
no Please Help Rohingya.
yes Sorry for your losses enough is enough time to protect America, Thank you President Trump.
no Jean-Franois Rivard WOW really like your DUMBASS works 7days a week without a off BITCH please. Stop being a ignorant ASSHAT.
yes Hahahahaha!! What did the EU stop you from doing then? #PoorOldBiffer #WheresTommeh :p
yes Trump you have our support stop those Democrats!! Dont back down...there are more supporters than not..
no So so sad and sorry for these families that have lost their loved one. Prayers
no I don't understand why the Democrats are against a wall - it's not about immigration - it's about letting people come into the country legally.  Chuck and Nancy are running their own agenda and not the agenda of the American People!
yes Donald Trump says his life was much better before he became president.  Believe me I truly understand.  My life was also better before he  became president.
yes Build the damn wall now!
yes WAR IS WONDERFUL WITH JESUS ON OUR SIDE! U.S. State Department approves $12 billion in military sales to Qatar, $8.2bn to Saudi Arabia, $50b to Israel and $1.4bn to Taiwan. America is the world's #1 arms dealer and has a military budget of $600 bn to Russia's $70bn!
no Leon Gerards Held
yes Wendi DelValle Im so sorry for your loss. Lets hope this wall gets built. Maybe it should be engraved with the names of all the lives that have been lost because we didnt have it.
yes Angela K Christensen You cant have national security without border security. Its not only necessary for any meaningful immigration reform; border security plays a crucial role in both the interdiction of illegal drugs and in defending America against criminal threats. Weak borders allow criminal and smugglers, as well as millions of illegal aliens, to have virtually free entrance to the United States.  If this was not true then why are there some 20 million ILLEGAL aliens living in the United States now, and why is there a drug epidemic killing thousands of Americans every year, and why are Americans being robbed and murdered by Illegal aliens.  Contrary to news reports the majority of these drugs are traceable to drug cartels in Mexico, not from pharmaceutical companies.
yes Ricardo Alfonso Saenz Jr.  your wall still wont be built
no Obama should of still been are present still.o ya.
no AMEN AND HALLELUJAH
yes Build that Wall....
yes Trump is a lying crook. If you believe what Trump says you're a SUCKER
yes James Chapman Yes I am already quite familiar with all of the Lies, Propaganda, and Fake News disseminated by the Central Fake News Agency operated out of the Oval Office and Trump Tower!!!
yes Go,go Don, build that wall mate. Wish we could in the UK.
yes Empathy!!!  What I see from Pelosi, Schumer, and other Democrats is a lack of empathy. My heart can feel that pain, I have family and children.  I cannot imagine to lose a child.  Yes, people have lack of empathy.
yes Why don't this matter to Peosi and Smuck?
yes Competition is key to competitive prices and work. When the people working don't care about their quality of work, they give out what they put into their work. Would you go to Walmart for all of your primary vehicle work to be done? Sure you will get a good job here and there but when you spend more at a different shop you will definitely have much better work done.
no You got this Mr President
yes While living in Chandler AZ...I was viciously raped by an illegal immigrant @ knifepoint in my own house after he broke in.
yes Don't ask it, you have already know it that d bitter truth 
yes None of those are good arguments however our underprotected border is a good argument and for all the reasons you just listed along with many others. Our gov is starting to deal with American problems yet we fight them....should be excited that we are trying to do something for America.and encourage it so that it may continue.
yes They have no right to be on American soil.  They do not respect the U.S. Then we have to pay for their babies.  Legals do it right.
no Sorry for the loss of your daughter.  This could of been avoided if there was a wall.
no Trumpsters cant handle truth can you..who's the looser dumb ass..
yes BEST President ever MAGA
yes Karl Hesford go to Chicago if you want the safty of gun control  !
no This is Fake news. I seen their faces on multiple marriage web sites. Why don't you talk about the American that just got fired from work and went back to kill multiple coworkers and himself
no Jeff Covington ...so far nothing seems to convince me of that...not because im closed minded either.
no An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
no How bout protecting their health and right to afford meidcation?
yes So sad America stands with President Trump
no Keep going President Trump
yes SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOST AND YES! FOR HER, FOR YOUR DAUGHTER, AND OUR DAUGHTERS AND SONS WE SHOULD, WE MUST, BUILD THE WALL ASAP!
yes Well Steve I've been called worse. I can live with that.
yes Build it Mr. President. For those saying think of what that money could do for vets and homeless, think about how much the 155 billion that we spend on illegals here could do for them. Stop illegal immigration stop the money bleed. The wall wont do it alone but it is part of the whole picture a piece of the puzzle that is greatly needed.
yes All these people that are coming into our country we are paying for their medical, education, food and their housing. We do not need any more people in this country I know I can't afford them. What other country can you go to who will pay for you to live there for free
yes BUILD THE WALL Donald J. Trump
yes It is not a problem that Americans kill Americans,  there is a big afraid  about a rare activity  .  NO  ONE  IS  ILLEGAL IN   A  STOLEN  LAND
no Sam Twal They already started here in Texas over a month ago. Come on down and see for yourself.
yes Syed Taqi talk about a STUPID thing to say. Wow. Smdh
yes Pretty sure you better build a wall around this guys forehead....good lawd
yes I am so sorry that you had to go through this traffic loss of your daughter. We will have our wall
no TYPING IN ALL CAPS MAKES EVERYONE FEEL IMPORTANT!!!
no Build that wall !! How do nuts like Nancy & Chuck have so much power that they can and DO stop America from being safe ?? And this Nancy woman lectures us about walls being immoral ??? She is a very sick person. Build that wall PLEASE ! I have kids, I want a country that still functions for them too !
no Maida Broadbent Williams is a dumbass Democrat.
yes Is there anyone alive who thought he wouldnt be leisurely eating & golfing today - on our dime - at his club - less than 24 hrs after declaring a national emergency?
yes Hal Bannasch you sir are an ass
yes Build it for the people that love this country
yes Jo Sechi
no Abdul Majid Legal! There is a difference
no All of the parents that loss kids to gun violence want their kids back too. Gun violence is a far greater danger to our country. Look up the two
no U should form a investgation on the deep state in are gov starting right in the doj n fb I...before they rig the election in 2020 Hope U listen to what am saying
yes Mr. President, keep up the great work! I'm totally behind you and support everything you have done and are doing for America! Finally, a President who cares for the well being, safety, and security of our country! Continue to stand strong, don't waiver, and keep on winning for America. We're not tired of winning yet!
no Cant believe how stupid he thinks we are! Some of us are capable of reading information from multiple sources, and critical thinking skills!
yes John N Karen Morris  sombody report me like that thanks to them now Im legal here jajajjaja
no Stupid wack. No but border wall is not a national emergency. Mass shootings are do not address again with your stupidity.
no An American just murdered 5 Americans and this is his focus
no Thank you Mr. PRESIDENT or doing what should have been done so long ago.  I do believe you love our country.  I dont know how you do it, but thank you.
yes White male gunmen gave killed more than anybody from Mexico   Parkland
yes I don't want to sound insensitive to your "chosen" example to support your platform or argument, but I think we need to talk about SUGAR.  We need to declare a state of emergency on that.  SUGAR is killing millions of Americans and stealing their teeth!!
no Jordan Miller wrong again. Had he not been here it would not have happened . Build the wall keep america safe. You people need to open yoyr eyes and take your rose colored glasses off. What a shame to see so many not wanting to pertect the american people. I am sure you and everyone elese has a fence or locks yoyr doors hey how bout shuts your doirs . Why do you have and do these things if walls dont work....
no Jim Villella Democrats dish out the same insults sadly.
yes I hope nobody invents tunnel technology.
yes Yes. I know what you mean. Time helps in some ways but not really. Every day without them gets harder too in many ways. It isn't like movies where it's a big emotional upset and then everyone moves on. Everyone around you has moved on but a big part of your heart is left in the past. Rachael was my dearest friend. I didn't know that until the night she died. The valley of the Shadow of Death is a dark place but there are so many wonderful people in there with us to encourage us along the way. It isn't a place we would ever choose to be, but here we are.
yes Guns kill more Americans in a month than illegals did in 10 years. Can we address that real national emergency tyrant?
yes Lost my son in El Paso due to illegal running red light hitting him walking across the street on his'way home from work. It was hit and run til his' girlfriend turned him in
no End of Democracy in USA.. so sad really.
no Chip Hauenstein agree
yes Far more homicides committed by regular Americans.
no Agree
no Danny Jones I feel for our British allies Elect a real leader thank Goodness President Trump was victorious or our culture be in the toilet also wheres Churchill when ya need him
no Betty Bilbrey 9/11 was an emergency. Waiting two years and not getting your way after a temper tantrum is not an emergency.
yes Commie run Hollywood pushes drugs and substance abuse in their movies. They set out to destroy nation states from within.
yes There are more important things like climate change, gun control and flint needs drinking water, just to name a few. There is NO emergency at the border!
no We need the WALL but I wish you would have torn up the spending bill! Pelosi will be going full bore out of spite now.
no Build that wall Donald
no So very sorry for your loss
yes Murder is murder, no matter the "status" of a person.
no Charlesetta Brown sooo....it was the same worst instincts while Bush , Clinton , and Onama were in office ? They pushed for it too...in their day
yes Gail Bailey Adams  I'm so sick of liberal stupidity.  Crime is a state issue.  This is a federal issue since it has to do with illegal immigration.   Stop voting Democrat, and your state will fair better.  Also, go back to school and educate yourself on state and federal issues.  You must have skipped government classes.
no Who is going to pay for the wall?
yes Mr.President America proud of you !!
yes This is all a joke, right?
yes Finish the wall
yes https://apple.news/AshdjozJ7TrWwla0EtHAtoA
no Mr. Donald John Trump our President Of The United States Of America never chose to be a common man. It is his right to be uncommon. He seeks the opportunity to develop whatever talents God gave him. Not security for his family. Security of the United States Of America. He does not wish to be a kept citizen. Humbled and dulled by having the state look after him. He wants to take a calculated risk: to dream and to build. To fail and to succeed. He refuses to barter incentive for a dole. He prefers the challenges of life to the guaranteed existence. The thrill of fulfillment to the stale calm of utopia. He will not trade freedom beneficence nor his dignity for a handout. He will never cower before any earthly master nor bend to any threat. It is his heritage to stand erect. proud and unafraid: to think and act himself, enjoy the benefits of his creations and to face the world boldly and say--This with God's help. I have done;'' All this is what It means to be an American.  God Bless America.  America First!!! Next big deal.  The State Of Jefferson. The Trump State. Soj51.org. It is time for 51
no Eva Graham Trump is an ass hole! Not to mention the "puppet" to PUTIN. TRAITOR TO AMERICA!!
yes I am so sorry for your loss..
yes Dave Sienknecht really, over 1100 came through an open area the other day.  That's one day.  Over 52,000 captured in December,  and those are the ones they caught.  Thousands more are in our country.  Illegal aliens come through open borders, and that is a fact.
yes I will say this; a barrier built on the borders will definitely help the situation. Dems that are against it, you can bet there're enclosed with a wall and massive iron gates and probably guards....What are they afraid of??? Okay; that's what the wall,barrier, is for. Security
no Support the wall yes absolutely agree with you.
no Alejandro Sanchez DRUGS! Not just the people.
no We need the wall
no Danny Jones so sorry for you guys
no Good morning & My best wishes to you both& yr family.Thanks for.remembering me & visiting here.
no No trust me the majority of us we feel for those Angel moms and one was too many this walls going up
yes Sorry for your loss sir.  True Americans are standing with our president to keep America safe.
no Kelli Annette Smith we are looking to lock up stupid people...what's your address. This is a about strange people sneaking in to hurt people....did ya see all those Angel Moms?? Did you see the families that didnt have to grieve?
yes What about the thousands who have been murdered by Americans who never should have been allowed a gun in the first place?
yes It already is addressed as it is illegal to drink and drive.
yes I don't feed into propaganda I have seen first hand. Walls do work they are built all the time for the purpose of stopping things.  if the wall is in place then we can focus towards what comes in through ports without the worry of it crossing over the border unprotected. I challenge u to take down one wall from the outside of your home apartment etc and you will see that walls work and that just because you don't see what can go in or out doesn't mean that it doesn't.
yes it,s going to take more then the wall
yes 20 six year olds died at Sandyhook Elementary school, all at once.
yes The sick idiots who are laugh reacting this post are the problem. Let's exchange them for legal immigrants. Give the immigrants all of their possessions, jobs, and money and send them to a shiihole counrty of their choosing.
no Robert Cee you're an idiot if you think you "don't need" Amazon.  How do you think you're going to afford The Green New Deal?  YOU CAN'T!  You progs are delusional socialist douches who like to confiscate OTHER PEOPLE'S wealth and use it how YOU see fit, like a dictator.  And  you couldn't survive without a safety net because da gubment is your daddy.  One other thing...if not for big business and tourism in NYC supporting you liberal takers NYC would be a giant slum.
yes SO SORRY. I Would BE SO ANGRY. THX FOR SHARING
yes Amen sorry for your lost
yes If a US military veteran with PTSD killed this man's daughter, would that make her death less hard to bear? Would he want veterans to be imprisoned behind a wall? If they were, would that make anyone any safer?
no https://youtu.be/6Km5O6T20zQ
yes GOOD  MAN.
no Illegal immigrant is a Russian that overstayed his visa
no Family is the most important happiness in life. Everybody wished to spend their life with families. Me too.
no People kill people every day. Illegal or not.
no It's totally ironic, that you fail to mention all the American citizens that die horrific deaths, at the hands of other American citizens. Such as all of the gun deaths that have been occurring. Why can't you step up and start dealing with all of the deaths by fire arms that are happening on a regular basis in this country !
no www.gofundme.com/thetrumpwall  Brian Kolfage
yes https://www.facebook.com/1478505579098739/posts/2383599701922651/
no First of all Nancy Pelosi took vacations twice instead of staying Wash.,DC to help solve the immigration problem  and therefore forced the gov't  to shut down. But the liberal Socialiatic Democrats see no problem that we pay her salary , she takes vacations on our money , doesn't  correct the out of control new young female Congresspeople. But opens her mouth continuously regarding our Pres. who stayed I. DC over the Holidays  to try to compromise with the  Socialistic Democratic obstructionists whose leader Pelisi was on vacation. So we the people allow our Pres.some R & R.
yes Nazi
yes David Monson 90 percent of drugs coming in from Mexico.
no Paul Karachia if we didn't have to spend over 100 billion every year on illegals, more could be spent to help the citizens! Walls don't work?  If you come to a wall you have 4 choices... Go over it, go under it, go around it, go back the same way you came.  Anything is better than nothing! Slow them down so border patrol can get there to apprehend.
yes What  about  the  thousands  killed  by  gun  violence
no I am not an American citizen, but I love what he stand for. God bless Pres. Donald J. Trump and God Bless  USA.the land of the Free.
yes Too bad the bill Trump signed allows DEM mayors and DEM municipalities to PREVENT the building of border barriers Provisions within the 1200 PAGE LONG bill make building a wall IMPOSSIBLE  thanks Republicans!
yes God saw fit to put a wall around Jerusalem as He does today in America
no Wendi DelValle Umm Im not trying to be a dick but what if it was someone else? Would you want a wall then?
yes Danny Jones you know what I want you to refund me the portion that goes from my taxes to this bloody wall because I don't want the pay for it.
no Build the wall!!!! Include California it!!!
no Sandy hook, San Bernardino, Parkland and just yesterday in Illinois?? So lets now focus on gun control!! Thank #45 for opening up national emergency - trump did set a precedent, there can now be real gun control via national emergency new guidelines just set!! Protection for all!!
yes so sorry for your lost
no https://youtu.be/zcNjW5NN9IE
yes I bet he is not a democrat.
no An illegal from El Salvador murdered my cousin, Destiny Tolodxi.   WE WANT THE WALL.   THAT IS DESTINY's WALL!!
yes He is trying to promote Nationalism which is biggest Face of the Devil
no Charlesetta Brown its waaaaay more than one plus them being here is a crime itself. Hence the name ILLEGAL
no Ron Gagnon so you're saying once the wall is built there be no more shootings no more deaths no more drugs in the United States. You're a fool and Trump is using scare tactics. There was just a murder yesterday no one has said one word about that that's because the guy was in the u.s. citizen he shot and killed five people and wounded five others
no We are spending so much money on illegal immigrants that a wall may not be such a bad idea at first I was pretty much against it but all the drugs are killing g so many people not to mention these immigrants get everything for free using taxpayers dollars yes maybe the money should be spent to help drug addiction or homeless or vets maybe we should have stricter laws for immigrants coming into this country I dont know if the wall will help but something has to give.  This country was built on immigrants only native Americans are Native American Indians but if u want to come to this country you should have to take the proper steps and come legally. My parents were legal immigrants and they never took any money from the government for help.  Im hoping that Trump is right and wall will help I just pray for unity and peace in our country
yes our own Tom Tillis voted for this horrible bill. Only 11 Republicans voted against this bill. What a sorry bunch of politicians. Republicans stabbing our President in the back.
no Build the wall now.
yes All you liberals need to shut up.  Build the wall and throw the liberals over it.
no Are we going to deport all the white locals who kill people? Road rage, mass shootings, etc? Immigrants commit far fewer crimes than native born Americans.
no Larry Fields, they are not all criminals just as all Americans are not criminals.  Not allowing those entrance who are seeking refuge or a better life is criminal!  Goodbye!
no Jesus.  His followers are so simple minded.
no Jim Butkowsky thats just if if that illegal person had not been here her daughter would be alive. #buildthewall
yes George Winn I still say it shouldn't be an emergency.  He's president, not dictator dude. He doesn't get to dictate policy.  Congress passed a bipartisan bill and Congress decided his wall isn't needed. He needs to suck it up, put his big boy pants on, and stop thinking he is a dictator and realize he won't always get his way and acting like an asshole all the time guarantees more often than not he won't.
yes Make sure nobody has guns in America, or at least they are registered and they are not assault weapon. Who  needs assault weapons in a peaceful country ?
yes She is so beautiful! Why why why ?
no Kylie Owen
yes The financial records of Every Politician who oppose border security needs to be openly investigated and made public! Those who scream the loudest should be investigated first! You dont oppose security unless you are profiting from it!
yes I can't imagine how it must feel to have lost your child to an invader and to have all the media and the US Congress care more for the invaders, than your child.   And then the one man who has shown any concern, the President of the US, betrays you by signing a bill that will flood the country with more illegals.  Shame on you Mr. President, shame on you for signing that atrocious bill.
yes Patti Cullen You confuse Trump with Obama. He thought he was above everyone and everything.
yes "...what about all ..."  This or that? How about enforce the fucking laws.  That's should be the common theme.
yes Americans buy the drugs. Who is the problem? Lol
no Yes Obama sent billions to Iran to build a wall!!! We weren't made aware of it but it was his parting gift to the hard workers of America
no Carol Starr my government turned their backs a long time ago I think.
no The wall must be built.
yes Eduardo Mendoza Is because of the savagery that some mexican people have in their blood, those Mexicans are also disliked in Mexico.
yes Charlesetta Brown yes, Obama had 8 quarters that had over 3% GDP.  The other 24 were horrible and he never had 3%+ annual GDP.   Obama pumped money into the economy.  He invested how many billions into green companies?  Almost everyone of them was bankrupt within six months.     Obama had unemployment going down yet at the same time so was job market participation rate, it hit a 40 year low.  People were not finding jobs, they were just getting taken off the roles.   Obama lowered taxes?  The Supreme Court ruled that the ACA was a tax, this giving Obama the largest tax increase in the history of the US.
yes Kris Landers , they already do hold others responsible. In Drunk driving accidents not only does the driver get sued but also the bar and the server. Same thing for house partys.
yes It's a shame you have to do all this for something that  as everyone can see is wrong do they not see the gangs in California or the pictures of the drugs that's caught at the border not just because you in office you the one trying to fix this...it's crazy they want it to stay the same....Do Americans care about America?
no Kerry Gay this family spoke about needing a wall.  So, he isn't using anyone.  You're very ignorant.  The cities who have the strictest gun control has the highest gun violence.  Crime in your state is up to your state, this is a federal government problem of protecting its borders. Please, try researching before speaking, because you definitely are ignorant in many areas, and ignorance is unbecoming!
yes What about all the people who come in through our airports on a tourist visa and overstay?
no An American killed my cousin when he was vacationing with his wife and kids in Fort Lauderdale Florida. He was crossing the street on a green light and this 24-year-old entitled drunk young  American women ran a red light and struck him. When the cops finally caught up with her she told me when I identified her in a line-up: "this is America and if you don't like it leave". I totally agree we need the wall to keep entitled Americans in and keep everybody else out. Let's make America safe again so that Americans can kill each other and not the rest of the world.
yes Timothy Kershner Illegal's do NOT belong in this country...let alone killing ANYONE...
yes Shut up youre annoying !!!
no Thank god!! about time!! I would pay for the wall myself if i had the money!!!
no Nazik Davoudian Zargarian they don't care a out anyone. Just votes! Using illigals to vote!
no Build the wall and take it all the way up the east side of California!!
yes But how do you expect to build something you came unprepared for. Where exactly is the funding for said wall coming from. Because it sure as hell not coming from the Democrats and it sure is hell not coming from Mexico. And its sad how youre making people suffer just because youre not getting your way. Only if you were real president and thought about the American people and didnt only think about yourself.
no Wheres them walls??
no Sad that you lost your daughter . I am praying something can be done in her name to ease the pain. Like building a wall so no one else will suffer at the hands of illegals .
no I JUST STARTED A LOVE TRUMP GROUP PLEASE JOIN SHOW SUPPORT FOR HIM TRUMP I HOPE TO GET MANY PEOPLE TO JOIN MY GROUP
no Go Donald!!!
yes I'm so sorry. I pray you will somehow be able to survive all the heartbreaking dynamics of  this absolutely horrible loss of your precious son. The Democrats have gone mad, and this is causing us so much grief and worry. My heartbreaks for you and your family, and I pray for you all and our country.
yes Carl Ostendarp On the guns there is a minor stumbling block for fools like you - its called THE CONSTITUTION!  I hope you know what that is! And your thought isnt new, you are just repeating the usual canned lying liberal talking points!
yes Terri Reeves well I dont know much about Chicago but I know that here, in Canada, there are probably only as much murders in a year than in Chicago alone, maybe less
no Mary L. Zweber  well, its all about the money.
no I am so sorry killing your Daughter!
no Danny Jones the life you enjoy now came through the exploitation of overseas colonial territories especially Africa and so you dont want to share what was stollen
yes BUILD THE WALL MR PRESIDENT!!!!!!! GOD BLESS YOU AND ALL YOU DO FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
no Anyone with any common sense or lives close to a border knows we need to build a wall and protect our country
yes Keep Trumpin Mr. President! We love you and stand behind your plan! You make us PROUD!
yes Sad thing is the Democrats don't care !  Vile !
no Being run over by an American is much better.
no However stats have proven over and over again that citizens commit way more crimes than illegals. I would think many of the illegals that do come here also get their guns here since it's so easy to do so. However I am against illegal immigration but the majority of our mass shootings are caused by white American citizens. President Obama deported more illegals than any other president. It's not the crisis that Trump's conning his base to believe. Stats show immigration from the southern border is the lowest in 50 years. Many of the suspected terrorist that have entered this country, came through Canada. Trump is conning his base lmao
yes Brought us out of a recession.  That's why he was elected again
no Ed Wrany One angel family does not a crisis make!!!!  Trump declares national emergency...  Nobodys done the job that weve done on the border,  said Donny as he declares a national emergency today........the slowest emergency in history.  And with the lawsuits that will ensue, his wall will not be funded or built until after the next election...if ever.  THE WORLDS SLOWEST EMERGENCY!!!!!  Donny lied directly to Americans about his border crisis.  Our Liar-in-Chief said that all the data that refutes his crisis designation is lies.  Got that?  Our president told the American people that THE FACTS ARE LIES...this is what all wannabe dictators say.  This egomaniac is THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!  Donny doesnt seem terribly concerned about this crisis.  He plans to travel to Florida mere hours after declaring the emergency from the White House. A president, in times of strife, would typically stay in the nations capital to oversee the crisis. Donny plans to do so from the comfort of his weekend getaway.  In reality, Donny is preparing the country for a fake war as he plans to enjoy a mini vacation. The only national emergency in America right now is one of leadership!!
yes Thank You President Trump!
no WE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM IN SOUTH AFRICA OF KILLINGS INOCENT PPLE..
yes I am neither a builder or scientist or whatever== WOULD IT BE FEASIBLE TO PUT SOLAR PANELS ON SECTIONS OF THE WALL?  If possible and Mexico would like to help pay every other panel could face South and both countries could benefit.
yes Kerri Siegler Stockin you live in the city with the most crime of anywhere in the country. None of them are immigrants there
no I totally agree especially here in California where the criminals have more right than the victims.
no Look an Angel Mom or Dad in the eye and tell them this is not an Emergency, Democrats suck....
yes Sam North yup
yes the democrats dont care they want the vote but the demos are very stupid the people coming in are going to vote for their own like in new york and minn   such stupid people in thes country
yes So sorry for your loss yes we must build the wall it Hass to be done
yes Sincerest prayers sent to the family of this lost woman, but using this story as justification for the wall is down right dumb.  Anyone could have been behind the wheel of that car, it doesnt matter who it was. There are drunk drivers all across America, so are we just gonna build walls around their houses to keep them off our roads too? This sounds a lot like a lot of arguments against vaccinations I hear too. Saying well so and so died and she had shots therefore vaccines are bad for you is very comparable. This woman could have been struck with or without the wall, it just so happens to be that the man was an illegal immigrant, and therefore people are using it.  Honestly, the logic behind a lot of such issues amazes me, not just the wall.
yes BINARY OPTIONS ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT.. Binary options trade has been developing rapidly over the last few years, This innovative approach to global markets allows people to quickly invest and extract profit from their investments without actually buying the asset that interests them. It is the price of these assets that is the focus of attention when dealing with binary options and the only thing people have to do is predict whether it will rise or fall in a certain period of time (Up or down). these are the only two things traders have to worry about, It was never so easy to become a successful trader all you need for success in binary options trading is a well approved broker to invest your money and get back profit in a week time. Your broker plays this role and point you in the right direction from the beginning of trade right up to the cashout of your profit. With a minimum investment of $300 you can make good profit of $3500 and $500 will earn you a profit of $5500 after a trading week.  If you're a newbie or a trader who has been loosing a lot of money recently you can contact me for more info on how you can go about the trading process.
yes China and berlin had a wall and look how that turn out
no What is going to keep us safe from the crazy misguided Democrat's? They are trying to tear up the constitution with one hand and trying to use it as a weapon with the other. They are the greatest treat to our republic.
yes SO SORRY.
yes An illegal immigrant gave me a blow job once while on vacation in Mexico it was excellent!!!!!!!! She didnt speak English and I didnt speak Mexican but she was beautiful and understood American currency. Overall a excellent cleaning lady on my all inclusive vacation
no i think it shoild be publicized in any venue that people know how drugs, guns, illegals, children are smuggled in to the USA.  might be enlightening as alot of people (if they 1st believe theres at so border problem) might thinkg alot of this stuff comes across in a standup, oiutmfront, inyour face manner, THINK AGAIN=these coyotes or whatever are real resource full.  USA.   
yes Dummycrats for prison 2019
yes Wait wasn't mexico paying for the wall?
yes Kevin Marquardt. Honey that is what LADDERS  and SHOVELS  are for. We need hi tech equipment and more security. Walls are outdated and can be breached, this is 2019 . There are better ways,  I am for new ways not a trumpty  vanity wall .  Another question,  why isn't Mexico paying  for it???? Hmmmm
yes White and Black American citizens killed tens of thousands of Americans. Where is THAT wall going to be built?
no Timothy Kershner  So that makes it OK ?
yes That's true go ahead Mr. President and If you want   let me know please
yes Mitch Haynie just like if Ted Bundy wasn't here right? Just like if Rudolph wasn't here right? The facts are the criminals are a dime a dozen like always. The majority of us are law abiding, and just fucking work to pay bills. You've all got some lazy ass, shitty no good criminals, in all your families as well. Should that label your entire family as criminals, or just the asshat who committed the crime? So entitled you are 
yes Sue Carol AND he decided during this frantic crisis that NOW is the best time to upgrade his golf simulator AND jet off to MarALago right after admitting the emergency isnt an emergency.
no Why do the Trump cultists always call people names? Are they 5 years old?
no To all of you Angel Families, my heart breaks for you because this never should have happened! God Bless you, God Bless our President and stand strong to support our country!
no Alex J Rod hes not building the wall with his own hands. He did what he needed to do. Do you ever do anything relaxing on your weekends or do you just work seven days a week?
no QUEEN WAS NEVER MY MOTHER OK MARGRET ROBSON AMEN 2001
no Exactly president you must stand to build the wall you need to protect the innocent american victime by the crimina illigal allien from othet countries pouring in here in the usa
no I am very sorry and I respect everyone who has been hurt by a illegal immigrant but the killing in SandyHook,Park land, and others school have been by people who are born here or are here llegal the wall is not going to put a end to people coming in but wait a minute who works from sunrise to sunset to pick up our fruits and vegetables that no one wants to pick up so that we can eat.Bad people come in all sizes and colors and from all over the world so don't get caught up in this game trump is playing on this nation because we would not be great if everyone who has done a little here and a little there wouldn't have helped us by the way they also come in from others places and nation and trump only picks on the Mexican border he should be grateful that his parents were not sended back to wherever they come from because it can also be said that  they were illegal immigrant too.
no The wall is a great start but,....without guards WITH "use deadly force", orders the wall will not be effective.

yes A 5 billion dollar investment to save 150 billion a year Build it Use the bill passed by the democrats in 2013
yes Re: Aurora. I could ask? Why so many murders in or near Chicago, in spite of strict gun laws?   And was does that have to do with wall, and the border, which is a completely different issue. There is no connection, or solution, common to the two.
no Charles Boyd Didnt they do that in Chicago, I heard it worked great lololol
no How about those people being killed by citizens. Should the build a wall around the whole United States? Stupid ass pendejo!!!
yes Build the wall and make Democrats pay for it.
yes John Gardner California  LARGEST INSANE ASYLUM IN THE WORLD  Interesting that the LA Times did this. All the others are staying away from it. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, this should be of great interest to you!  Just One State - be sure and read the last part...  try for 3 times.  This is only one State... If this doesn't open your eyes, nothing will!  From the LA. Times:  1. 40% of all workers in LA County (10.2 million people) are working for cash; and not paying taxes. This is because they are predominantly illegal immigrants, working without a green card. (Donald Trump was right)  2. 95 %of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens.  3. 75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens.  4. Over 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers.  5. Nearly 35% of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals; they are here illegally.  6. Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages.  7. The FBI reports half of all gang members in Los Angeles are most likely illegal aliens from south of the border.  8 Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal.  9. 21 radio stations in LA are Spanish-speaking.  10. In LA County, 5.1 million people speak English; 3.9 million, speak Spanish. (There are 10.2 million people, in LA County.  (All 10 of the above facts were published in the Los Angeles Times)  Less than 2% of illegal aliens are picking our crops, but 29% are on welfare.  Over 70% of the United States' annual population growth, ( and over 90% of California, Florida, and New York), results from immigration.  Also, 29% of inmates in federal prisons are illegal aliens.  We are fools for letting this continue.  HOW CAN YOU HELP?  Send copies of this letter, to at least two other people.  To 100, would be even better.
yes Walls do work
yes Bill Johnson   You should be saying make America sane again.  Not to worry,  With proper therapeutic intervention you will some day come to terms with the realization of having betrayed your country at the ballot box, handing it over to a Russian crime syndicate headed by a mentally and emotionally damaged New York City gangster.
yes Charlesetta Brown please provide the name and address of your loved one for the next death cause by an illegal!!
yes Kevin Peevey  no... that won't stop natural US citizens from drinking and driving and causing fatal accidents... it's only a news story because he was an illegal immigrant... if it was a white guy it would have been a completely normal occurrence
yes https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1690237991078876&id=443476065755081  Even Pelosi said so before her party affiliation was bigger than her American.  Straight from the ass' mouth.  Hmm.

Now I know you will do the same with Melania's Family who got in via Chain Migration again because your a fair President and not the self serving hypocrite that anyone with an ounce of intelligence knows you are.   MAGA.
yes Our country isnt a house and one of the main functions of walls is to retain heat.
no Tony Palmer in fact, the wall encourages immigrants to stay. Otherwise they would return home yearly. Now they are stuck here.

yes Protect us from vacinnes injuries too!!
no Trump I support this build the wall finish the wall crime will fall!!
yes there are criminals everywhere, some illegals other legals, other born here or anywhere, Timothy McVeigh killed many people and he was not illegal, yet some of his ancestors came  here probably from Europe without the consent of the real Native Americans, the real owners of this land, and this land was taken from them using force, lies and genocide. Immigrants move across the whole word for different reasons, some are bad people, other have PTSD but most of them want a better life. So dont  put things out of context to make your point. all crimes are bad, but  show the data where it say most crimes are committed by illegals.
yes Brandon Turner it won't  bring her brother back but it will save someone else's brother. BUILD THE WALL

no Paul Karachia ever climbed a wall?
no Tell that to the ranchers on the border whose property and homes are invaded regularly by illegals.
no And enforce e-verify.  Let the activists and lawyers who have gained by the issues help Mexican citizens to do it right!
no if the wall would only save 1 life...yours...i'd still fight for it
yes and yesterday a US citizen killed five people and a year ago 17....and everyday citizens are killed by guns....why aren't they as important as this girl? Why are you not asking for money to address the real concerns in the US?
yes Linda Durbin oh yea sure, working hard... what action did he take after the Las Vegas massacre? Thoughts and prayers? 
no Feb 15th at 11:00 am. I sent my 2 letters to the psychiatrist saying i do not consent to abilify cause of adverse drug reaction and the other that i will further discuss with the media if she continues with other meds. All day noone came to pick me up to take me to the hospital. If it was such a concern i would have been in again. Postponing my review panel until i get another lawyer this time low income. Unless they decide its not worth it anymore. They wasted my time with bs. I need to work! Back to work tonight thank god! Dont worry Donald justice will prevail!
yes My mom was hit by an illegal immigrant and he tried to drive off. He pulled out in front of her and totaled her car. On another occasion my dad was hit by one going the wrong way and drunk on the highway. Totaled his car and hurt him pretty bad.

yes Is it means an iligal spanish ???
no Undocumented immigrant receives Medal of Honor for his actions in combat and is beaten with a baseball bat when he returns home. On Nov. 27, 1944, squad leader Macario Garcia and his platoon were pinned down in Germanys Huertgen Forest, under intense mortar and machine-gun fire. In the unrelenting barrage of the Nazi attack, several of Garcias men were killed or wounded. Garcia himself was hit in the shoulder. He crawled toward nearby underbrush as a machine-gun and various riflemen attempted to finish him off. Garcia was wearing the uniform of an American G.I. He was wearing the dog tags of an American GI. He was leading a squad of American G.I.s. He was not, however, an American citizen. Garcia was an undocumented immigrant. For his actions in the Huertgen Forest  taking out two machine-gun nests single-handedly while seriously wounded, saving the lives of his men and advancing the American position  Macario Garcia was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. Upon entering a diner only one month after his return to the United States, dressed in full uniform with combat medals, he was refused service because of his race and beaten with a baseball bat and arrested. https://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/What-if-Houston-war-hero-Macario-Garcia-had-been-12815055.php
no Jennifer Smith let me guess u r proud of the ladies in white....baby killer club
yes Yes even though more white Americans kill or injure people than any other race....
no No need for basic logic huh?
yes Make love on guns .I dare you .in fact if your sooo convinced .then rather than use government forces to enforce your views come take my guns yourself
yes And yet, Nancy won't meet with Angel Moms or Dads. I hope America remembers that!
no Right cause illegal immigrants are the only ones who kill people drinking and driving.
no The Murdering Illegal needs to lose his life.
no I think Pelosi is head and shoulders kinder and a better leader than Trump! Let Nancy Pelosi give us the tools to give fair and honest border protection. Trump made a big noise with his big mouth and I don't really appreciate or much need his work.
yes Tara Letourneau Exactly it's logical and preventative, a safety measure.
yes Doing what's needed to have been done for DECADES....
yes Ask Nancy Pelosi, the wall around her home works well.
yes But Ruto will never be president.
yes If you ask the American citizens on the border they will say otherwise
yes Wrong, manbaby! People will ALWAYS find a way around the wall. Too many ways...
no Nothing sadder than a woman supporting an abusive man.
no Allyson Stuhlmiller 24 years old
no Thank  you president  for keeping us safe
no Absolutely agree
no And Americans kill each other on a daily basis,like the killings today.
no And as a UK tax payer you know that we pay a lot to the UK but we also get funding back don't we ?
yes Following this logic, shouldnt you be focusing on common sense gun laws, affordable healthcare for all including prescription medications,  the opioid crisis, and livable wages for all? The family youre using to politicize this issue have suffered an unspeakable and horrific tragedy - just like all of the families in the mass shootings have along with all of the families that lost loved ones due to being priced out of medical treatment.
no Hal Eric Mitlitsky With any luck that won't be for AT LEAST another 5 years. Hopefully more.
yes A US Worker allowed my son's wheelchair to roll off of a loading dock because they didn't put the brake on, he could have been impaled with this wheelchair tray but thankfully only ended up with 7 stitches in his head and scars on his hands where the skin was scraped off.
yes President Trump do you have a response to the Speaker of the House and Diane Feinsteins threats of a Civil War yo disarm law Abiding Americans citizens?
yes He's a minute man. I am sure he killed a lot of immigrants. Or allowed them to cross over the border with out properly identifying the immigrants. So where's the justification in that?
no Eva Graham. Agreed
yes Sharon Fantana    Are you really that ignorant?  The Wall works for Israel....use common sense (but I dont think you have any).
yes So sorry for your loss. God comfort you and family.
yes Stewart Schaniel guns are not being taken away just laws to make sure they are in the right hands. Because remember guns do not kill people but people kill people. We need mental health checks, and training and awareness. These are the laws that need to be in place. It is called common sense gun laws.
yes Not illegal immigrant. ILLEGAL ALIEN
no So sad Go Trump BTW
no Idiotic.
yes The devil goes about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. Don't sell your souls.  It is way past time to declare a national emergency to get the God-hating, man-hating, freedom-hating, America-hating, Trump-hating, power-loving cancers out of our government.
yes That's not very Christian of you cunt
yes Leon Rackauskas so you dont care about the other 143 police officers killed by the general population
no Michael Thompson  yes!! But Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher.
no Emily Neal so more gun laws that criminals wont obey, got it
no .. https://www.foxnews.com/us/illinois-workplace-shooting-leaves-5-dead-shooter-killed-officials-say
no 1 anerican is to many
no People dont realize that more Americans kill Americans than anyone else. Why isn't that being talked about? I live in El Paso. That stretch of road is known to have deadly accidents. It just so happened that this individual was an immigrant. However if it were to be any other driver, it would fit the propaganda, but here we are. The dad of the victim is even writing about walls in newspapers. Why not argue about slowing down the speed limit at that stretch of road? Why not argue that the city should install more security features? No. Your go to solution - only because this man is an immigrant - is to build a 5.7 billion wall. A wall which btw already exists in El Paso, where this happened. Yet, it still happened. Bet you didnt even know that info. Hell, I bet even after learning this info, you'll turn a blind eye and argue something random about a wall. Just think about your own hatred for a second. You're brainwashed and dont even realize it.
no What about all the civilians, that were born here, killing each other?   Theres larger issues than what you bring to the table don.
yes Pay attention please.    Experts have reported that  "The Wall "  will not keep out illegals.  Therefore, the 8 billion dollars that Trump wants for a wall  will be in addition to the amount paid out for Medicare, Medicaid and food since the Wall will not be effective.    Most illegals overstay VISAs or they come in through legal points of entry.
no What experts Ron O'Hearn?
yes President Trump, I am so thankful you are our President. Thank you and your wonderful family for working so hard for us. All of you are in my prayers.
yes Curtis Rice 2020 !!!!!
yes You are right and I am always on your side.
yes shut the hell you ignorant pussy grabber backer this is exactlly what you all done to President Obama so suck it up butter cup
yes Crime has no color. Hate and resentment only bring more turmoil. Trust in God. Not in a wall or Trump.
yes James Brubaker  Okay just did, here are all the articles that showed up about BORDER AGENTS in Texas and their views on Trumps imaginary crisis.  You resorting to insults of me and my heritage display your complete inability to participate in any informed discussion and any further attempts on my part will clearly fall on your deaf ears. I just hope someone does a complete search of their views after seeing this information.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/qz.com/1520651/border-patrol-agents-in-texas-showed-trump-why-his-wall-wont-work/amp/  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/texas/amp/Texas-border-communities-cringe-as-Trump-sounds-13518898.php  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.chron.com/news/politics/amp/Texas-congressman-calls-Trump-border-remarks-13539330.php  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.haaretz.com/amp/world-news/border-agent-explains-to-trump-why-a-wall-won-t-solve-the-problem-1.6831070
yes Emily Neal let me continue your story.  So, after he's denied a gun at a store, he buys one off the streets and shoots up a school anyway..  problem not solved.
no It's a sad day in America when we lose a life to someone who shouldnt be here! Even sadder when you know that the very people standing in the way from making it stop are right there with a rebuttal of national emergency on gun violence..I wont get started on what I think...(event are very coincidental and I dont believe in coincidence) They only care about their votes and are hanging American citizens out to dry!  Wake up America, we are being destroyed from within!
yes After running as a reformer, selling out your supporters and patronizing the dem and rep pty- see Omnibus spending bill
yes Build the wall immediately
yes More propaganda
no Let's see a person with a gun walks in to public and opens fire. Democrats are like ban all guns. Yet a person enters our country illegally and commits a crime. Dems are like... Give them benefits. But no dont do anything to control the problem. #speakingoutofbothsidesofyourmouth #prioritieswhatsthat
yes I live in Southern California a little west of Palm Springs and I say any City or State that becomes a Sanctuary City or Sanctuary State, thereby not enforcing Immigration Law, now can NOT enforce ANY Law. No one can be arrested for rape, robbery, assault, murder, etc., because that would be picking and choosing which Laws to enforce and which Laws to not enforce. The Employers who hire illegals, the Judges, Congressmen, Prosecutors, Mayors, Governors, and Church-Sanctuary People of those cities and states should be held accountable and arrested as accomplices for aiding and abetting illegals, and endangering the lives of United States Citizens. Yes, it IS that simple.
no Gus Keller Um, it's a public phone number, doesn't make us snitches. We actually don't know anyone here illegally. We have helped people achieve legal status over the years. Not a snitch, just believe "Don't do the crime, if you can't do the time." - From the Wife.
yes A warrior. Unless it's raining. Or if his bone spurs aren't acting up.
yes President Trump has my full support. Build that wall!

yes https://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/my-white-friend-asked-me-on-facebook-to-explain-white-privilege-i-decided-to-be-honest-20170809
yes Yes, OK...BUT, we also need to take Sanctuary Cities, completely off the CHARTS...IT'S A INSANE IDEA......
yes Because the father of the slain daughter is agreeing we need it is totally political.
yes Lisa Mann Not if you have military patrols on top of the wall complete with towers, gun turrets & fully equipped resource centers that the troops/ICE can use.  Israel's border wall does it's job quite well, I haven't lost a friend to a suicide bombing in over 10 years.
yes The border is 2000 miles long what's 200 miles of wall going to do really?
yes Ask all The elitists to tear down the walls around their homes. Lets see how many do.
yes Ashton Thompson Pearl Brown Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR

yes Question about any one that believes walls wont work do prisons deploy walls anyone Ive ever seen does I surely dont see criminals running wild
no Abdul Majid Try to be informed rather than just opinionated. Smh
no Thank You, Mr President.
yes When I ask my self this question. About the wall. And weight out all the pros and cons. I came up with this.  I had a daughter. That was involved in. Human trafficking. She did not even know she was doing it. Because of the drugs and the influence. It had on her. She call us. And wanted to come home for a few days. I knew she was a prostitute. And it was hard to just think that some day Im going to get a phone call. From the police. Saying your daughter is dead. In my heart. Was a broken heart. To think what she was doing. She was MIA. Then out of the blue she called. I asked her questions. How are you. When are you going to come home. She would not say nothing. Out of shame. I would begin to cry. She would say dad dont cry. This is my choice. So I asked her this. What are you doing right now.  She told me. She was at the bus stop. To pick up some girls. From New York. I asked why. Because her pimp wanted her to. I told her. That is human trafficking. She said whats that. And I told her. What human trafficking is. And what happens to girls. She took the girls to a safe house. And she had to stay with them until the pimps. Muscle guys. Came and took him away. She told me they were 12 to 15-year-olds. She never saw those girls again after that night when the muscleman came and took them.  If a wall just stops one of these acts and prevent someone from getting killed from drugs to me its worth having the wall. If they cant come to America legally then they should not come at all does it read those their grandparents or someone they know that wanted to come to America had to either come here legally or illegally. Lives matters. And walls will save lives.
yes GOD S NOT HUMAN. How does he become a child ? Who created Mary. you don't think !!!      Kuran CHAPTER 5 maide verses116 And Allah will say, "O Jesus son of Mary, did you say to the people, `Take me and my mother as gods rather than Allah?'" He will say, "Glory be to You! It is not for me to say what I have no right to. Had I said it, You would have known it. You know what is in my soul, and I do not know what is in Your soul. You are the Knower of the hidden 117  I only told them what You commanded me: that you shall worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them while I was among them; but when You took me to Yourself, You became the Watcher over themYou are Witness over everything.        THE TORAH AND THE  BBLE ARE THE BOOK OF ALLAH.   BUT WAS CHANGED LATER. QURAN CHAPTER  2 BAKARA VERSE 79  So woe to those who write the Scripture with their own hands, and then say, "This is from Allah," that they may exchange it for a little price. Woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they earn.   GOD S NOT HUMAN. HOW DOES HE BECOME A CHLD? GOD S ONE. AND GOD S ALLAH. AND ALLAH S ONE. AND REAL S ONE. AND NEVER AND NEVER DONT CHANGE.  QURAN CHAPTER  3 AL- MRAN VERSES 59  The likeness of Jesus in Allah's sight is that of Adam: He created him from dust, then said to him, "Be," and he was.   60  The truth is from your Lord, so do not be of those who doubt.   https://www.quranwow.com/#/ch/1/t1/ar-allah/t2/en-itania/a1/alafasy-64/a2/itania-64/v/2     Quran sure 3 al-i imran 19  Religion with Allah is Islam. Those to whom the Scripture was given differed only after knowledge came to them, out of envy among themselves. Whoever rejects the signs of AllahAllah is quick to take account.  AND  85  Whoever seeks other than Islam as a religion, it will not be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers.
yes BUILD THE WALL MR. TRUMP.
yes For those who think there's no problem at the border...lend me your ear for a first hand story we heard today.  My son's  truck was stolen in San Antonio. Two weeks later they found it in Larado.  The sheriff said the seats are missing.  They take them out to fit more people to bring them across the border. They like the 4 wheel drives so they can drive through the ranches.  He said they get 200 stolen cars a day like this. Not 2 but 200!!! Multiply that by as many as they can stuff in the truck without any seats. Now multiply that by 365 days in a year.  Now tell me there's  no problem at the border and I will tell you you're crazy. Build the wall!!! I'm over it!!
yes It isn't a damned competition you myopic virtue signaling troll! Illegal border jumpers are not supposed to be here, FULL STOP!  By your logic lets let them in because we already have mass murderers?! That is really a very special kind of stupid, princess!
yes Right wing Trump supporters have killed over 50 on school and public area mass shootings. We need to deport all Trump supporters and impeach/remove Trump
yes Naomi Samuelson why??
yes Yes we should
no Is the not the land off the free cus it dont look like that to me
yes #LAME guess we'll move ya out of Georgia & send ya across border when it's done to let ya see how they're
yes One illegal????You better get some facts together.
no Instead to put Joaqun "El Chapo" Guzmn (The drugs dealer in prison for life time and cost the tax payer paid for his accommodation for life time, I have a good idea, Why not Joaqun "El Chapo" Guzmn paid to pay for the wall with a lots of extra money for his freedom
no Mike Caffes if you can find one then contact your local police department and give them the evidence.
no Linda Durbin  You mean golfing so hard
no trump is a moron. how many angrys can i get for this?
yes Patti Cullen, picking on the wrong President for that. Obama was definitely the one that thought that.
no "The only national emergency is that our president is an idiot"  Ann Coulter
yes Lisa Fuller no they smart , YOU low minded and naive. Greetings from the free World with a free Press and Moral and Ethics and Human Values and Social Responsibility for all People BLACK WITHE BROWN GREEN GREY or BLUE
yes Trump is right, Build the Wall Now...

yes Chip Thornton  Yes they do.
yes https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2019/01/10/there-is-no-border-crisis/#67ccd8cd6a52
no Absolutly
yes We need to start by getting the Democrats out of office !
no Danny I wasnt aware that being trash was an actual culture. The more you know
no Republicans are murdering exponentially more people by denying the affordable health care and drugs than people being killed by illegal aliens. I'm sure most killings by illegal aliens are domestic or murders of people they know. Illegals aren't running around shooting people for the hell of it. But stupid Trump followers believe what ever the orange toad tells them.
yes If you're so worried about people killing people, please build a wall all around America.
yes on and on-yes we have a national emergency- BUILD THE WALL
no Only America haters are against the Wall.
yes Melissa Lamphere so what you're saying then is you want to foster/sponsor a family of illegals? Now remember no background check of any kind. Just open your door. Let'em right in to your home. I love how awesome of a person you are.
no Everybody knows it is normal for Human Beings to loath someone like Trump that constantly lies to them like the vast majority of Americans do!!! So why does the Trump Cult so easily accept Trump's constant lying to them??? That is very abnormal! .......though of course Cult's throughout history have always excepted this disgraceful behaviour from their false idol!!!
yes Sorry for your loss, Them people in Texas are being paid to stop the wall.  Do you know how many millions Soros, Clintons and the cartel are going to loose in drug money with the wall.  What people are doing to our kids is despicable
yes Is there any data on how common this is?
yes So Im guessing its ok if the murderer was from America? Well thats who is committing the majority of murders here. Americans.
yes Trump prison 20 to life
yes ohh Jess still in the mood ,,Us and Them,,. Like they are subhumans. Even if some of Them are responsable for terorist atacks like in Paris 2015 ,Madrid 2003 or London 2005 we Europeans still living in relative peace with Them. Them = ilegal imigrants as u  name them. And we have Shenghen space=free Borders between countries.
yes Angel Roy Was it 6 ft tall..
yes The question is, would a wall have stopped this guy from coming here? No, because the vast majority come across ports of entry, not the desert.
no Please DONT sign the Border Wall bill.   TOO much Fat in 1100 pages.
yes Fear mongering douchebag
no Thank you, President Trump!! If there has ever been a time to declare an emergency, it's now!! Invasion of our country IS a dire emergency! Unlike weather emergencies, the problem with invasions from our southern border will not "blow over", but will only get worse. Thank you for your work and determination to prevent our beautiful country from being turned into another Mexico. Behind you 100%! May God bless you and all your endeavors!
yes ttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/12/francillon-pierre-cold-case-mom-amy-fleming-arrested-after-30-years/2849712002
no To lose a loved one at the hands of someone who is not even supposed to be here is a slap in the face of justice. Build the wall!
yes He drove they let him across. The border patrol is part of the problem wall wont work Military
no Joyce Ames He has a good point..Where are Trumps words for the 5 Americans gunned down yesterday...49 days in 2019 and 39 mass shootings!Not one of them done by an illegal..
yes I understand if you react badly to this post because it's against your political views but you 400 or so people who laughed are disgusting. He lost his DAUGHTER. this is NOT a funny post whatsoever.
no They probably gonna call border patrol on you
yes Kim Thompson I do not listen to anyone but MY President Donald J. Trump I do not listen to LIARS or democrats.  Call it what you want>WALL,FENCING, BARRIERS but it is going up!                                                     Wall or Fence?  According to Vocabulary.com, The difference between a fence and a wall is that you can almost always see through a fence, at least to some degree, while a wall is solid.  If thats the case, then what is going up is fence. But, to be fair, many politicians, media figures and even border experts often use the terms wall and fence interchangeably.  And so has Trump                                                                        at times.https://www.factcheck.org/2018/04/has-the-border-wall-begun/
yes We need a class action law suit against every liberal that wont protect us & get the wall built & secure our borders !!! How many attorneys are willing to help us do this ????
yes Dallas Woody that was one of the worse decision EU made!
no Democrats are so full of hate for president trump they dont care about anyone being killed.  They only care about gaining control.
yes What a novelty this President Trump is.  He puts Americans and America first and tries to help everyone else after that. We need more politicians like him.
yes What about the white man that killed his family? Or the black man killed but the police. Or the kids shot up in the school by a natural born American? Just curious. I sympathize with ANY one who has lost a loved one due to senseless acts of an individual but how hypocritical of you to make the focus on one race. Hell what about the families of the slave? You can post a articles like this all day on all races. SAD!
yes Serious question: Did the (previous administration's) Operation Fast and Furious SCANDAL guns "WALK" over the open border? Or go through the Ports of Entry?  Untrackable Guns that got into the wrong hands.
yes Sheikh F Shahel hi
yes Why don't people just build walls around there houses and pay for it themselves. That makes more since to me. You should even get a tax break if you build a wall around your house.
yes Wait til one of them crazy gun toting bastards shoot your ass
yes Amen death penalty for those who kill our citizens
yes So what are you going to do about to do about your own murdering citizens Mr Trump, throw them over the wall
no And this is why crazy people need to be monitored more closely
no Who you calling stupid I flunked math but my intelligence is above average!   99 percent of people surveyed say they are above average.     And the other half is even higher, if you asked them about their children.
yes Build the wall and stop this crap before we the silent majority have to.
no Trump is one president and leader that truly loves our country! God Bless you every day in your work to keep us safe ! The Lord hears our prayers and you have  a lot of people praying for you.
no America is a continent dumbass are you talking about . the United States ...
yes Hey Dave, I believe that might be the stupidest response I have ever seen on immigration. Thank you, now you may STFU...
yes Temicka Brown move?
no So many against the border wall until if affects them. Wake up before it affects you and your family. Illegal immigrants are all over the country, not just in Texas and Arizona. They travel, too. All of the muslims getting elected are plabnin ghb to take over our government. That will affect your way of life and all generations to come. Vote against this
yes It's about time to put the fucking baboons in check! Sick of all the squabbling! We need a wall asap and those who disagree can leave this country! Why do people have locks on doors? To keep the ones that don't belong out.
no you bunch of brain washed cock heads will be the death of all of the human race , so gullibull. being lead by the ring in your nose to the chopping block , how the hell are there so many of you ?
yes Robert Dahlquist very good point. And very true! That's why as Servers, we are trained and certified about these things since we can be held responsible.
yes "Hardship!"  you mean like Officer Rohnil Singh's family is facing, or the tens of thousands of families whose loved ones will never be whole again?!  Like our 36 year old daughter who died last June because of illegals?!  Is that the kind of hardship you mean?!  At least those Americans in hardship have been made whole, and I did not hear of the shutdown killing one person!  #FinishTheWallNOW! #DeportThemAll!
yes He should be able to have an eye for an eye
no Abdul Majid she's legal...
yes We will be no safer and billions of dollars poorer.  Its a farce
yes https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/us/gun-deaths.htmlNearly 40,000 People Died From Guns in U.S. Last Year, Highest in 50 Yearsnytimes.com
yes Danny Jones where is the EU
yes Ask OBama!
yes So many sad stories caused by unsecured borders for many years and many presidents. Trump is going to fix it.
yes Please get the wall built!!!!!
yes Geoffrey Hostens so you wouldn't feel the same if she was ugly? Shame on you!
yes Let's not lose anymore of our children due to something we can work on to make safer
yes Steven Hunter Do you not understand that anyone who commits a crime and has to be locked up is separated from their children? That includes American citizens. That is the fault of the person who chose to commit the crime, like entering our country illegally.
no Aren't we all illegal immigrants?
yes Use the Drug Cartels money to build  the Wall!Amen +++
no SUCH BULLSHIT. Nothing to do with a damn wall.
no Teresa Pagniano  sorry for your loss but it was your brothers fault.!!
yes All this fear-mongering about illegals ... what about all the US Citizens pulling the same crap?
yes How hypocritical of Democrats who want to take guns from people because some are used to commit violent crime, but at the same time advocate free passage across our borders by many who have used them.
no #buildthewall #deportthemAll. #trump2020
yes Hop Sing Get them out
no Sam Twal just stay in your own little world that the rest of us call California
yes Theres a system and should be to get in any country our safety/ health should be upmost at the top of the list go do it trump
yes Thank you Best President in my time.  MAGA
yes 5 private citizens were killed at work in Aurora, Illinois on Friday. 5 police officers were injured while subduing the gunman, who was also killed.  The gunman was an employee who was being terminated.  His Illinois gun permit was pulled because he had a conviction in Mississippi, and the gun he purchased under that permit should have been confiscated.  This is a national emergency.  Five families in one day, lost a son, husband, father, brother, etc., killed by an American citizen who should not have had a gun.  39,000 people were killed by guns in our country last year.  That is a national emergency.
yes Democrats only care about illegals.
no The democrat communists lie everytime they open their mouths
no Kris Landers thats just stupid a person thats not supposed to be in this country it is called a illegal alien that person should not be here to be able to drink to kill a person seems to me youre not very smart actually the store owners fault also if she did not have a legal ID the store owner should be prosecuted and lose their liquor license to and get a fine but come onHopefully you dont have that many rocks rolling around in your head
no Tommy Carpenter How was he voted in illegally?  He won the Popular vote and Electoral College vote each time ...Trump lost the Popular vote...even with Putin's help
yes Agreed.  Democrats want to rebel but how much money Oblamma give Iran?
yes All the Dems I know want it built!!!!
yes We got your back 100 percent
no Build that wall!!!
no Americans kill Americans every day ~ are you going to build a wall to keep them away from law abiding citizens as well?  Not all illegals are bad but those are the only ones the news will tell you about ~ There are many who are honest people and want better
no Barnaby Rockefeller
no CliffandKim Ferrell   Republicans think we hate Trump more than we love America.  The truth is, we hate Trump because we love America.
yes Higher than our national average.
yes Mr. President we have been going to build a wall since Clinton! I support you being a real American President and getting it done!!!!!! The hoards are forming and are on their way!!!
yes Peter Richards 3/4 of a woman isn't 1 ? Do the math...here I'll help , 31 out of 100 , reduce it down 3.1 out of 10...reduced further .8 out of three , since there's no such thing as .8 of a person it would be 1...therefore the Sunday comics you use as mainstream media holds no relevance...have a nice day...to simplify...doing the math , it is 1 out of 3
yes If they truly don't work, as Liberals suggest then why are they so against them?
yes I hope the wall prevent missiles to come in too. Trump with all his BS is making the US look stupid and weak. He needs to really focus on how to make the country more powerful, not spending all of our money on dumb stuff.  Some of our allies are turning on us. Lately key allies like Turkey and India. He is just flexing and hoping to intimidate, that does not work anymore. He needs to act smarter.
no Yes. And I can hardly wait for the next Democrat President to decide that the need for universal healthcare and sensible gun control and global warming are all national emergencies
yes We need more posts like this.  News only reports about not wanting the wall. Never about the American people wanting it. That's why trump was voted in.  I am sure if it was one of those loud mouth reporters on television that lost a loved one they would be singing a different tune.   Or the Democrats in office.  I was a Democrat,switched over to Republican when trump was  running.
yes We need  your  voice  to  make  sure  she did not  die in vain.  Praying  God  will  help  you  through.
yes This poor family-in my thoughts & prayers!!
yes Its time to abolish the Democratic Party
yes If you're anti wall, then you're pro-slavery. If the wall stops the sale of one human being then it's worth every  penny. #StopSlaveryNow #BuildTheWall
no Scott Pennington you clearly dont understand much about the EU.
no Ron O'Hearn no I am anti Trumps form of nationalism and the product that is starting to be produced here in America.
yes We have to do something, walls do work and will force them to come through the port of entry.
yes So sad. Up with the wall
yes I love this cause its neglecting the fact that American people kill each other too. he's trying to control the population by using immigrants as a sort of scapegoats, kind of like a certain German I know
yes https://www.facebook.com/jddmcl/posts/525820511244061John DearolfThis was a jarring week as Trump declared a national emergency after Congress refused to fund his wall  perhaps his most brazen authoritarian act yet. Trumps... More
no Build the wall out of their foreheads
yes It should resigning as your highest priority.  You are an old senile sad old man
no Just an excuse for the federal system to seize ranches from solid Texas families without compensation. Be careful trump you will turn Texas against you.
no Doug Holmes move to USA Troll.
no Prayers for you and your family
yes http://www.weathermodification.com/ Protect us from the tyrants controlling the weather.
yes Only 30% of illegals get her through the border. The rest get here by over staying visas. Ask Trump what his plan is to stop that from happening. You want to stop illegals, address the primary way they get here or become illegal and stay. If not, you arent bein very serious about the issue.
no Build that wall. Lets get it on.
no BUILD THE WALL!!! Best President ever!
yes It's a STUPID argument...  it doesn't matter if the WALL is the most perfect deterrent - it's worth trying as part of border security.  What's the big deal about the money for the wall? Trump will have saved that much and more with his trade deals.  #buildthewall
yes Jess Castrejn thats why he donated his salary to studying alcoholism. Action speak louder than words
yes Estefania Torres Restrepo The southern border might as well be considered a port of entry. Cause they sure as heck enter through it. We cant just have open desert between the two countries where people are free to roam back and forth.
no It wont ever matter.  They will all keep making excuses.
no We need to give credit where it is so .Our Presadent
yes Term limits on welfare recipients
no It's a tragedy.
yes Build two rows of concertina mount .50 every half mile post a no mans land. That will work ask North and South Korea.......!!!
no Kris Landers so if the illegal was kept out because the illegal doesnt belong here, the drunk driving case involving said illegal wouldnt have happened.
yes How can you not associate mass shootings in this country to easy access to firearms?
yes We are behind you!  Build that wall  !!!
no Gary Lynn McGhee it means nothing.
yes I support you, Mr. President. I pray for you every day.
yes A border wall won't bring back the dead folks who have been killed by home grown American citizens or by illegal immigrants (who may have come in through an airport).  It is despicable to exploit peoples' personal tragedies for political reasons.
yes When my son was at a camp for young people with disabilities, US workers never called me to tell me my son had a fever and was ill. When I came to pick him up, he had a 102 fever and was sitting in his own waste for hours.
yes Whatever u do in life, please think about safety first. I wish African Leaders can start acting like mr Trump. Mostly Nigeria
yes Thank you President Trump!! God Bless you and this country!!!
no Stopping drugs at our ports and better tracking expired visas works better. Get El Chapo (Great Idea Ted Cruz) to pay for the wall and put that money into port security and visa tracking. Most bang for the buck.
no Although, wall construction may be slow, I hope everyone understands we would not even be having this conversation if Donald Trump were not the president.  Jeb Bush, no wall, Hillary definitely no wall, so the president IS getting the wall built and fighting the democrat party and half the republican party every step of the way.  This is OUR country, it doesn't belong to illegal aliens.  We are not here to serve illegals with tax payer dollars and benefits.
yes Nancy agrees! https://www.facebook.com/395216814380642/posts/397943094108014?sfns=mo
no Correct
yes Sheikh F Shahel ?
no https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/crime/2015/03/08/ped-killed-newark/24605963/  A white male killed my friend. Im going to assume he is a citizen.
no Eva Graham three equal branches!! Trump thinks hes above the Constitution!
yes Chris Weiss just because they were registered Democrats doesnt make them Christians.
no Sorry for your loss build the wall
yes yes we want the wall
no A white American men hit and run my truck where is the wall?
yes that sad
yes Joyce Ames hates pesky facts
yes Mar Reese  I know thats sad ... I m all for keeping our country safe build the wall
no Jason Hicks so a wall makes no difference
yes The only wall we needa build is around trumps goofy havin assss
yes This chick is dumb as hell. They do have background checks. In fact you go on a 3 day waiting list. I can go down to the corner of my house in the ghetto and buy a gun off the streets with no background check and the gun won't even have a serial number on it also known as a throw away. So again remind me how gun control is gonna work???
yes Jeanie Railsback sorry about your husband but if he was an illegal he wouldnt have to have insurance and his health care would be free in California!
yes The truth is the TRUTH, no matter what the left says. They may believe their lies, we don't.
no Build the wall.    Screw Nancy Pelosi
no WWG1WGA  #KEEPAMERICAGREAT WELOVE YOU
no MISTER PRESIDENT! OVER HERE!
no Yes, build wall
yes Heavenly Creator, Loving Parent, Holy Spirit, Divine Providence, Almighty,  We Praise You. We Thank You for All You Have Done, for All You Are Doing, and for All You Are Going to Do.  Please,  Bless the USA and President Trump indeed. Increase our territory for You.  Keep Your Hand on US. Keep US from evil and keep evil away from US. Help US to do no harm. May Your Reign Come, May Your Will Be Done, On Earth as It Is in Heaven. For Yours Is the Reign, and the Power and the Glory, Forever and Ever. MAGA! KAGAlways!
yes Would it make a fucking difference if it was someone else?
no Betsy Hammond do you realize we could have all that, is the Democrats would stop wasting $150 billion a year in benefits and protection, for illegals. Not to mention the money they spend hiring lawyers to fight depression of illegals who are felons, sanctuary cities, etc.
yes Curtis Rice are you trying toget an award for the dumbest post of the day?
yes Me myself don't like my tax dollar going to support illegals jumping our boarders just for the free ride it has to stop
yes https://www.facebook.com/TheOther98/photos/a.115969958413991/3022739964403628/?type=3&theater
yes You have been conned!  Paying Osama bin laden and George Soros and George W Bush won't fix anything.  A tall tree and a short rope is all you need to stop them.
yes I am so sorry for your loss.  I support your call for the wall as well.
yes & why shouldnt we have a wall???  Lets hear some logical reasons......
no Build the wall!
no Durrrrr duh durrrrrr (drool) Trump!!
no OCCASIONAL cORTEX.................................SHE SAYS THAT SINCE SHE IS ETHICALLY CORRECT( POLITICALLY CORRECT) IT IS OK THAT SHE IS FACTUALLY INCORRECT, OR, IN THE COMMON JARGON, LIES. SOCIALISTS THINK ITS OK TO LIE TO PROMOTE THEIR PLATFORM........
no It's clear, they just don't want our President Donald J. Trump to succeed. He's not one of "them" and they can't stand it. The amount he's asking for is like $57 of a "normal" family budget in comparison to the national budget. If someone offered to put a fence around your house for $57 would YOU do it??
yes Go to school learn to spell you are a subhuman species.
no Exploiting a dead woman is not the way to promote the building of walls. Think about the tunnels as well.
yes So sad you had to go through this horrible pain
yes Brother do you like Nirvana?
yes YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP IS VERRY CRAZY...
no Robert Cee yeah I do. He actually does what he says!  Oh and where's your impeachment for Russian collusion?  LoL epic fucktardedness
yes Keith Webber Jr. While he takes the money from the military infrastructure budget which will cause our military families to suffer more than they do now in housing that is falling apart. Pendejo!
no So very sad. On a avg. 5 Americans are killed on a daily bases  in one way or another by a illegal. AND YET the Democrats still do not give a damn!
yes EASTENDERS CORNER MEGAN UMBRELLA RHIANNA BLIND WITCHY CAR BATTERY TOLD A DROPPING IT LEAD CAT EYES STARE ME OUT POTTATOE HEAD BEAR COPY CAT SULPHURIC ACID STRONG OFF ITT
no Go trump
no If you want the wall pitch in your money to pay for it. Kind of a socialist thing to demand we pay for a wall the majority dont want or need.
yes Shirley Wilson prove it!
yes Chet Bentley youre a scumbag
yes Peter Richards look at boarder patrol statistics. I believe the people on the front lines. They support our President.
no They have killed more with all the deadly drugs they bring in . Yes their not all bad but with the wall it will stop the madness . Trump is trying to make America safe again democrats are stopping it .  Its very simple it wasnt very long ago with Obama     the Democrats wanted a wall to stop the illegals but now they are resisting because if trumps succeeds in getting a wall up and making America safe the Democrats will be on a sinking ship with a giant hole in the middle of it. The old schoolers need to look and see the  Democrat party they once believed in is long gone .  But they are lied to telling them Trump will take away Social Security and Medicare.  Its a lie . Trump said you earned it . God Bless America and lets come together as one .
yes Eva Graham Freedom of Speech!
no We need tougher alcohol laws my 19 year old died of a bau of .53, not old enough to buy and not old enough to be served the parents of another boy served over 200 kids most 16 and other then made them all drive home and they got nothing. For killing my son. Tougher alcohol laws please President Trump.
yes Sam North  mental heath issues! Cant force crazy people to get help so what is it you think can be done?  That company had the obligation to protect its employees that is NOT the governments job!! We have security at my company with a locked fence only a badge can get you in and cameras right there if face dont match you dont get in and when someone is fired we are all notified!!! Companies need to step up
no I sooo agree with COMPLETE OUR WAII TO PROTECT OUR BORDERS !!
no 110 % behind you...2020 we will show the power of the people again !!!
yes Stephen Mattison Nazi's used propaganda like Democrat and Liberal hate news does does to condemn the Jews. Demonizing a whole group of people for the crimes voting for Trump  is never justifiable. are Democrats taking money from the drug cartels politicians all see motivated by money over the best interest for Americans ,their position has no logic,with More than 70,200 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2017, including illicit drugs and prescription opioidsa 2-fold increase in a decade. ... Drug overdose deaths rose from 16,849 in 1999 to 70,237 in 2017. The bars are overlaid by lines showing the number of deaths by gender from 1999 to 2017 (Source: CDC WONDER).
yes One man, one incident undocumented as the alleged DUI perp was.   How would a wall have helped?  This DUI perp came through the border like over 90% of these cases do.  Help us understand how a wall would have helped!  This article is NOT a plea for a wall but rather more border security.  Every Congress person agrees we need border security.  A wall?  Nah!
no Horrific stories and I cant believe most think there is no emergency.  There certainly IS.
yes prayers for your family
yes Angela K Christensen.   Anybody who raises their hand would be foolish. We all know they came in by plane. A better question is raise your hand if you think the current wall is the reason all the Fentanyl was confiscated 2 weeks ago. Enough to kill 57000 people. That is the better question. Obviously those drugs wouldn't be coming into a port of entry if there was no wall. They would have come over in backpacks at points of the border where there isn't enough security.
no Paid writer
yes It is so sad that a leader would use the personal tragedies of a relatively small number of Americans to stoke fear in lots of Americans.  Perfection, in anything, cannot be obtained and sustained. We humans simply are not capable of perfection.  During Trumps Presidency to date, far more kids have been killed 8n their schools that Americans who have been killed by folk in our country illegally.  Seems like a greater emergency to me.....
yes Children killed in Sandy Hook, by a homegrown terrorist.   https://www.kveller.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-14-at-2.26.44-PM-1200x734.pngwww.kveller.comkveller.com

yes Build The American Wall  !!!!
yes What about the thousands of parents their children were killed by AMERICANS with guns?  Veterans. Medical care. Sorry about your daughter. But come on guys. We have WAY more impactful priorities!  Vanity wall. #TemperTantrum
yes Six prior arrests. Not required to submit for fingerprints to own a gun. Only when he applied for a concealed weapon permit was his prior arrests made known. Concealed carry permit denied. Gun was never turned into authorities. One of the five people killed was a university student interning in Human Resources. Over 1200 kids killed by guns since Parkland and none of these gun murders constitutes a national emergency.
no No TAXIZZZ
yes Tell the truth Donald Trump...ONLY THE WHITE ONES....ONLY THE WHITE ONES!
yes Samuel Tan Yuan Han and white men stole this land from the brown people.  So whats your point.  You think your better than them?  You arent
yes So when we building a border wall on Canada
yes Trump is playing ya'll for fools. Every politician does it.  They say "look over there!  They are your enemy!"  Meanwhile committing crimes around the planet with their oligarch partners.
no BUILD THAT WALL!!!!!!
yes LOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP! Trump is doing something worthy of impeachment. LOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP! 1
yes If walls didnt work then why do people keep building them?  Why do people build fences if they dont work? Do you live in a home? with 4 walls? I dont want my kids growing up in a world where they have to build walls around their hearts all because we couldnt build a wall on OUR border.
no Bill Clinton Declared 17 Emergencies, have fun with those court cases.....
yes Art Jackson hmmm, I lived down there and let me tell ya Art, not too long ago in El Paso, the drug dealers put razor blades on park swings and so forth. YOU call that safe? I do not. Try driving down there on the free way or the streets on the east side, some don't know how to drive with lines. My daughter had a friend down there whose father was found in the Rio Grande and the drones had to go find him. Hmmm safe, yeah right.
no Lisa Fuller yes
yes Im sorry for all the loses. GOD BLESS the ANGEL families. In my prayers.
yes Drunk driving is already illegal. Police are given tools to stop it
no Dave Callender Youre an idiot. Of course Americans kill others in accidents. The point is that if these uneducated, illegals never came here those deaths they caused never wouldve happened. If the wall saves just one life its worth it.
no Wall work that's true,  America first Donald Trump MAGA 2020!!!!
no There is no reason to believe a wall would have prevented this. It will not solve all your problems. It will disappoint you and give you a false sense of security.
yes That's true!!!!!
yes If that wall saves 1 ONE, American life from being a victim of these illegal border jumpers it is worth every dime!
no what about all the kids and adults who die by homegrown, born in the usa, murderers?
no Thank you President Trump!
yes An illegal alien (Honduran) kicked-in the door to my house and tried to murder my then-16 yr old son.  https://youtu.be/6h2qwAAge4c  A few years prior to that, an intoxicated illegal alien crashed into me, totaling my vehicle and damaging my left hand (which has never healed correctly).  Build the wall!
yes Chuck Brantley cant debate with stupid
yes Build the wall Tell Nancy to suck a bag of onions
yes An illegal immigrant killed one of my friends, I dont blame them all for it. Thats stupid. The choice of an individual doesnt reflect all of them
yes https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/opinion/trump-offers-socialism-for-the-rich-capitalism-for-everyone-else/ar-BBTr9Ux
no Michael Thompson been to places with walls too  Seen mfers climbing over them
yes Haters wouldnt be hating if there Son or daughter was killed by a illegal immigrant! Securing our borders is a priority! Walls, barriers, wire whatever! We have a crisis on our hands! I almost bet if it was a different President declaring this all you haters would be for it! Pretty dang sad let Our President Trump do his job!
no Then why do we have the h2a programs in place???
yes You take such hate for USa .  I Love You & Pray for you & yours.  You know GODS got yall
yes Men in this country on student visas from SAUDI ARABIA flew planes into the World Trade Center  Whats trumps answer to that?  Kneel at the Saudi princes feet....  Now  please tell me who the enemy of the state is?
no Build the wall. # TRUMP 2020
yes Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin 5) American Business  ~Investment is flooding back into the United States due to the tax cuts.  ~Over $450 billion dollars has already poured back into the U.S., including more than $300 billion in the first quarter of 2018.  ~Retail sales have surged. Commerce Department figures from August show that retail sales increased 0.5 percent in July 2018, an increase of 6.4 percent from July 2017.  ~ISMs index of manufacturing scored its highest reading in 14 years.  ~Worker productivity is the highest it has been in more than three years. Steel and aluminum producers are re-opening.  ~Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and NASDAQ have all notched record highs.  ~Dow hit record highs 70 times in 2017 alone, the most ever recorded in one year.
no Name calling????  Big joke.  Dems are the champion name callers.
yes So sorry for your lose. Can I just say though. Britain is surrounded by water. The wall will only work if your government isnt self serving and encouraging very high migration or immigration to keep wages down and their bunces up. This is the problem with the Western world. The polital elite are in it for themselves.
yes I am so sorry for your loss RIP.  We will ner forget.
no trump is USING them to further his agenda he couldnt give a crap about them
yes Traggic indeed, but what about when US citizens/residents massacre people using guns? 
yes Ginny Johnson
yes It is a national crisis and anyone thinking otherwise should go live at the border for a month!!
yes Food for thought, if the person who wrote this post doesnt reply, its a bot
yes Sharon Fantana why don't you ask Israel who had a ton of enemies?
yes Dude things change get over it
yes donald u the man
yes So sorry.
no 2018---Of the 154 MASS Shootings in USA not one was perpetrated by black, undocumented immigrants or females!!!!! But the truth is never liked, is it? All were committed by HOME GROWN WHITE MEN!!!
yes Nazi's used propaganda like Trump does to condemn the Jews. Demonizing a whole group of people for the crimes of the very few is never justifiable.
no If every American donated a dollar for a brick we could raise the money..build our wall....
no And you still get people who laugh at this. . What fucknuts.
no My heart aches for those that have unnecessarily lost a loved one bc someone was here illegally. I cannot even imagine the pain they are enduring over and over again every time they hear comments like, the wall is immoral.  There are more stories out there that I am sure havent been heard. For example, my son got in an accident with an illegal who pulled out of his driveway and smashed in the side of my sons car. Praise God my son wasnt injured, but I couldnt say that much about his car. The police told him there was nothing he could do bc the guy had no insurance, no drivers license, and was here illegally. My son had to shoulder all the expenses. Never should have happened. These incidents and more are why this problem needs to be cracked down on. Praying that President Trump resolves this problem and once again makes America safe again.
yes Nazi's used propaganda like Trump does to condemn the Jews.
yes why are you so stupid
no Walls work so keep that Freeland out! Make them tariffs on Canadian steel non negotiable! Canada must pay a price!
yes The democrat communists offer them all kinds of freebies and when they come here they find out it was a lie ? How would you react? So its all the democrat communists plan to destroy America and become kings and make us slaves
yes Jeanie, you should've "kept your doctor".
yes These socialist love chaos. If we dont put down Socialism we will be in trouble real soon
no God Bless you and your family.
no When our country is attacked by China or Russia because his puerile tactics make our once strong country look like a laughing stock to all the world, I want you to tell me again the he is a great president.   He is making our country the fool of the world by running it like the moronic clown he is.   You're as delusional as he is.  If you're not terrified then you're as much of a fool as he is.
yes Trump lacks certain qualities which are appreciated by good and decent people. He has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace.  He is a bully.  That is, except when he is among bullies like Putin; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling boot licker instead. The rules of basic decency cannot be found in Trump. He punches downwards  which a gentleman should, would, could never do  and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless  and he kicks them when they are down. The fact that a third of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think Yeah, he seems like my kind of guy is a matter of confusion and distress to people worldwide. There have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid. As reported in Japanese newspapers, Trump specifically asked Japanese PM Abe to nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize.    Twice before he submitted forged nominations on his own behalf because he is so desperately jealous of Obama.    How embarassingly sad is that?   Trump will never ever get a Nobel Peace Prize because he creates chaos and strife every single day....the opposite of peace.
yes Mathieu Gouman BUILD THE WALL
no Ohh I am so sorry I am just  broken and angry to keep hearing about these stories of families that are horribly hurt and affected by the awful illegals coming into OUR country.... BUILD THE WALL ... keep them OUT
yes We need more from many those have met the illegals.  Wake up everyone. Illegals and Muslims are the worse and we need protection from them.
no Great wall of China work. Jerusalem wall work. US must have wall. Overdue
no Soo beautiful.. Now a true angel. My deepest condolences.
no Abolish the Democrat party and let's call  them for what they are Communist socialist party.
yes Angel Roy walls are built to keep people/animals inside.
no The constitution clearly states that congress controls the purse strings.   This has not been a priority for either parties since the inauguration in 2017.    Congress does not give the executive branch money.     https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-constitution-and-the-federal-budget-process/
no Are we just gonna over look the massive foreheads
no Larry Lubiner so, you didn't pay attention about the thousands of migrants coming up from south America? What you are claiming is ridiculous!
yes Hah, hah, hah...  How funny you are, right?
yes John N Karen Morris not all of us are snitches John
yes Keep building the wall and deploying razor wire.
yes Also enforce the law in regards to USCIS form I 9
yes All the school shootings been done by Americans all the church shootings been done by americans.
yes Prayers for England
no Liar
no You are full of lies and bullshit
no Danny Jones absolutely
no  If we don't have the funds to build the wall along our own southern border  Then stop sending American tax-payer funded financial aid to foreign countries, stop financial aid to illegal aliens, stop importing cheap labor, stop allowing and enabling US jobs and industries to be outsourced to foreign countries and do not import foreign fuel, steel nor electronics used in our military weapons, national defense systems and power grids  Build the wall and guard the border using our drone and satellite surveillance systems to find and turn back unauthorized intruders  Also, hire our veterans and former law enforcement officers to monitor and minimize visa over stays.  This is The United States of America, it's our country and being a US Citizen is absolutely relevant  What the American People clearly want and need are more elected officials that will actually start putting the best interests of our own US CITIZENS first and foremost, and that includes appointing judges and others that will do the same.  For the first time in 30 years, we finally have a president that's actually doing something about our traitorous trade and immigration policies  And the corrupt manipulative media, establishment puppet politicians and their globalist masters are blatantly fighting President Trump and the American People tooth and nail every step of the way.
yes Pierre-Luc Vachon how's that gun control working out in Chicago?  Crime is UP since they started it there.
no But for the 1200 children killed in the US by guns since the Parkland massacre a year ago, sadly no emergency or protection there...
yes awful nice fear mongering you got there
no Melissa Lamphere you're triggered and brainwashed the wall is being built and it's beutiful. MAGA
no Eddie Gonzalez no one wants illegals hear besides idiots
no Waiting for congress to fund the act passed years before by the democrats to secure the border. Do you think he wants to take this to Supreme Court?
yes So sad but yes please do the wall!!!
no I agree  build the wall and protect America . So sorry and deeply saddened for your loss sir.
yes praying for you angel Dad...
no They crashed into my son's truck twice. No drivers license or insurance
no AMAAAAAAZING how many Right Wingers have become socialists by wanting US to pay for the wall.
no Thank you, Mr. President, for all that you do for Americans. You are a true patriot.  Happy President's Day! God Bless
yes Spencer Hilbrink  ooh
yes I don't think so.have had a child killed,
no I bet you if you look hard enough, you could find a murderer, who was in the military years ago and save the life of another Soldier!
yes First President that had to fight for Border Security as if it was a political issue rather than a National Security issue.  Something has gone wrong in American politics when one party weaponizes an American issue and uses it as a bartering tool thinking they will impress others and get their votes....they would be wrong on so many levels.
yes Curtis Rice lol - these comments are great. No one can even pull a BreitBart article above crime based on demographic.
yes Erin Salgado seriously? Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher.
yes I mourn your loss. However, declaring a national crisis and putting up a concrete wall will never solve America's immigration issues. Ronald Reagan once said  "Mr. Gorbachev, Tear Down This Wall. Bottom line, this is pure politics. It's all about satisfying his extreme right wing tea party base. Let the experts decide how best to solve our border issues. America is a democracy, not a dictatorship. The president continues to make up things and lie to the American people.
yes So when are we building the walls around our schools? And movie theaters? And workplaces? And concert venues (need a roof for that one, too)? And when are we putting all of the white males who have killed SO many more than immigrants in this country in kennels? I'm not belittling the loss of even one child, it's tragic and heartbreaking, but declaring a "state of emergency" over a few bad people who also happen to be immigrants does not make sense when we have mass killings on THIS side of the border.  A wall wouldn't stop most of they illegal immigration, we know that most come through other routes, and therefore it's false logic to assume it would have saved any of the lives he is exploiting. Do take the money allotted to beef up where they DO come through, and spend money fighting mass shootings of Americans BY Americans.
yes Patti Piccione Zambuto they can be verified
no BUILD THE WALL! HAPPY PRESIDENTS DAY MR TRUMP. GOD BLESS YOU & THE USA!
no I Thank you for all you have done for us
yes But you are opposed to gun control.....
yes Amen thanks Trump for protecting us getting bad drugs out

no How is building a wall to protect our citizens a violation to our constitution???
yes Bob Vasel if gun reform saves one life are you for it?
yes Mr. President donate your paycheck for our beatiful lovely wall that you promise so i could sleep peacefully and secured...by the way let me teach your wife how to make mexican chorizo she will love it thank you GOD BLESS AMERICA
yes Daryl SR Johnson  make that two of us and I can put a crew together when your ready
yes Dor Cohen sickening
no Nice
no wait till one of them have a wreck into nancy or chucks family
no James Chapman Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin fake crisis is your opinion you got from media opinion. Truth is the voters, the president & Federal border agents disagree. What one would you choose, media bias or the source of people who are on the boarder, the president who has access to info no one else does, the voters who put someone in office to do a job that has gone unchecked for years? Why are the Trump Zealots alway making False Claims and False Accusations??? Sorry unlike the Trump Cult I think for myself though my observations are often later repeated on various media. I have know President hoax for decades and he has always been a very FAKE MAN and Pathological Liar that has no credibility. His whole life is built around lies. He is nothing more than a very successful snake oil and elixir salesman. I lived on the border when many more people were crossing the border at the busiest part of the border and there was no crisis or emergency.It is not true that moist people that live or work on the border want a Useless Wall that can be easily circumvented. What most people want including people that live and work there is smart border security. That is what we need. Trump has created a completely fictitious emergency so that he and his cult can get what they want which is completely wasting billions of dollars in taxpayers money. But you ain't gonna get it as We The People, and that is the great majority of American's, oppose the Wall. Trump and his Cult will not get their BOONDOGGLE WALL!!! Get over your obsession and move on!!!!
yes Interesting you talk about research because you havent posted a link to any article. Can you post a link to the article you received these statistics?  Here is an LA Times article posted Last week saying that there isnt a crisis at the border.   https://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-trump-speech-immigration-border-crisis-20190206-story.html  Also Im not sure how the history of the country I was born in should have any say in who I am as a person? What if I judged you on the history of America? Last I checked, white people today should have no burden placed on them for the atrocities of slavery in America. Let me know since thats what Ive been reading.
no Build the wall please
yes So sorry for your loss!
no http://ourfilm.org/
yes So what are you doing about the most recent mass shooting?
yes Daniel Alexander Allen How Many illegals should we deliver to your door. I am tired of them. It pulling theyre weight here in America.. Let them get in line and come in the legal way. https://www.watchdog.org/national/reports-illegal-immigrants-receiving-medicaid-costs-taxpayers-billion-annually/article_6a9860a6-d0bd-11e8-92ed-5bca8b2d3b38.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=user-share
no hummm maybe you might need to learn to be a better driver with all those wrecks.  just saying seems like it is always someone elses fault 2 sides to a story
no Meren Tinu  let them i do believe President Trump is pulling out of there! Let China or Russia pay for them now I mean their own people are starving but hey I think its time America worried about America
no Wake up America  ! Wake up Christian church  ! Impeach remove your Satanism from office  The Democratic party has become the nazi party hualacost murdering babies  ! Remember Beghanzi fraudulent claims  Remember the selling of uranium to Iran  Remember 150billion under table to Iran  Remember KAVANAUGH hearings  SAVE America Save the family
no Thank you President Trump, please continue to gather the funds to build our country's beautiful border wall..
yes How many people have been killed by a citizen?  Dumb argument
yes CRIMINALS COME IN ALL COLORS.....just saying.
yes Devin Diamond  Im so sorry for your loss:(
no As it turns out, back in 2011 then-President Barack Obama issued an executive order blocking property of transnational criminal organizations. Obama cited his authority as granted through the Constitution to invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701, and the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1601. The latter is the same legislation that Trump is citing to get funding for the wall to achieve his immigration reform goals. That executive order targeted a number of criminal organizations, including the Mexican Los Zetas cartel, an ally of the MS-13 gang President Trump has regularly called out as a danger to Americans.
yes Asking the Lord to guide you, give you His wisdom and protection during this time. You have my support
yes So very, very sorry.
no Now the Dems r in-sighting Protest against the presidents national emergency which will turn into riots which will turn into blaming it on the Republican president for inciting bad behavior even though the Democrats are the ones that calling for the protest
no A wall won't completely STOP the illegals from coming in but it will deter them and slow them down cause nothing is going to STOP them from coming in completely
yes Will Murray
yes Gun control will protect to the county. I dont wanna see another school shooting....
no President trump 2020 !!!!!!
yes So terrible!!!
no Michael Najm They will if they make the deal!
yes #BuildTheWall #MAGA
yes I live in Brownsville, TX., front lines. We had a steel slat high fence built here in our area seems like 7-8 years ago now. Only problem I see thats not being addressed, is that along the border here where the Rio Grande River the apparently we have EPA regulations blocking anything being built within a certain distance from the river... So in many cases the fence is several miles inland on the U.S. side, dividing private land and surface streets. There are gaps in the fence in these areas so people can drive through and access that part of Brownsville. Seems like it would do more good if we fixed the EPA regulation and built a gap-less fence on the border instead of hindering access to privately owned land. I used to drive patients to their appointments and frequently pass through the fence unchecked in a 13 passenger van.
yes I want to protect Mexico from the guns flowing in to the cartels hands from the US.   Protect little Foreign boys and girls from being smuggled north and raped by rich pedophile Hollywood Elites and  other Democrats.  Stop powerful drugs that are being introduced to all races of Americans and wreaking havoc on their lives, their health, and their loved ones.  Stop the unnecessary deaths caused by the lure of an open border, and by the criminals that repeatedly enter illegally and do harm to our citizens and legal residents..  Democrats never opposed a wall as part of border security until they decided that if Patriotic, Constitution loving, law abiding citizens will not support their extremely authoritarian and oppressive agenda, they would create Sanctuaries for illegal aliens to colonize America with people who know how to live under oppression and accept authoritarian rule.
yes Justin. they are too stupid to be reasoned with
yes Daniel Jenkins everything!

yes #BUILDTHEWALL secure our borders President #TRUMP do whatever you have to do to get it done asap.
no And how many US citizens have been killed by other legal US citizens in mass shootings? Oh, but somehow that's more acceptable to you?
yes Thanks Mr President
yes Pure Propaganda.
no #bestpresidentever
no How Democrats and Republicancrats are against the wall boggles my mind. Many Republicans give lip service, but when push comes to shove, they aren't much different than the Democrats. Keep exposing the RHINOS.
no Patty Bertocchini La Puma that only stands to reason because US citizens outnumber ILLEGALS like 20 -1 but let's not ignore the fact that they dont belong here and are a drain on taxpayers, government resources,  and our economy.  The fact that they kill and rape people is only 1of the many reasons to keep them out do you have a fence around your house? Doors with locks on your house ? Same thing
no Walls do work. Why else do we build them? Just the other day I built a barricade to keep my dog in the living room. Guess what, It worked. :D
yes Eddie Barrett 49 days into 2019 and 39 mass shootings already.
yes Although it seems crazy but without a wall people can cross from 390 to 260 people to reach the United States as we have seen in the news, with a wall that will cost them to cross that amount. The president is right
yes No wall will be built. You know it
yes Edgar D. Gutierrez the first lady was here LEGALLY and then became A LEGAL CITIZEN. What part dont you understand so that I can dumb it down to your level.
no James McFarlane You can certainly have him. Any respect I might have had for him vanished the day he referred to Hispanics as murders and rapists. As if we in the US have only law abiding citizens.
yes I'm illegall.....
no Carly Nacarato  Youre full of it, but youre a little snot nose Millennial.
yes And AMERICAN born CITIZENS are killing my fellow AMERICAN FRIENDS !!!
yes Hi from Sweden
yes Gree Gree Yes. If murders got what they deserved maybe they'd be less of them.
yes All in all just another prick and his wall
yes #why do those who die without lslam enter fire? #Because he did not worship God who created him# #Is justice that God punished Jesus in order to forgive us our sins? #If Jesus is God how he struck,where is His Power? #You worship someone like you
yes People that don't get this are sick in their head.
yes Renee Korabiak ,there was? Too bad it failed!
no Lisa Mann it would, but Trumpcucks are very very stupid.
yes trump leads through fear. Just don't buy it!!
yes Steven Keslar why do you feel the need for name calling. I swear u should have been a liberal

no Bill Johnson One angel family does not a crisis make!!!!  Trump declares national emergency...  Nobodys done the job that weve done on the border,  said Donny as he declares a national emergency today........the slowest emergency in history.  And with the lawsuits that will ensue, his wall will not be funded or built until after the next election...if ever.  THE WORLDS SLOWEST EMERGENCY!!!!!  Donny lied directly to Americans about his border crisis.  Our Liar-in-Chief said that all the data that refutes his crisis designation is lies.  Got that?  Our president told the American people that THE FACTS ARE LIES...this is what all wannabe dictators say.  This egomaniac is THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!  Donny doesnt seem terribly concerned about this crisis.  He plans to travel to Florida mere hours after declaring the emergency from the White House. A president, in times of strife, would typically stay in the nations capital to oversee the crisis. Donny plans to do so from the comfort of his weekend getaway.  In reality, Donny is preparing the country for a fake war as he plans to enjoy a mini vacation. The only national emergency in America right now is one of leadership!!
no I am so sorry. I agree with you 100%. God bless your family. Keep fighting. You will save someone's life.
no An Army friend of mine from TX once told me in 2001 that when he goes home he wears a border patrol hat just to stir things up and clears the street. When I asked him why he said that his parents came over here legally from Mexico and that it wasn't always easy growing up but they were always proud and that people that come here illegally a just make it harder for everyone else and have no honor. When he and his siblings grew up they went to work for border patrol and the one in the Army. He's who I got my immigration views from because I can respect that.
no Come on Republicans... Sure up party lines and defeat any and all attempts to block our declaration.
no Estefania Torres Restrepo A Wall will keep out hundreds of illegals. Then more attention can be given at legal ports of entry to stop drugs flowing into the country. More people could be after the over stayed visa people.
no Syed Taqi missed the point stupid!!
no Yes.  Build the WALL!
yes You are so stupid. Please get your head out if your ass and stop being a fear monger. Show the comparison of people killed by other Americans in all of the mass shootings. Walls don't fix that..  Stupid.
yes India full support
no Bitvrealky, the immigration allowing amnesty for anyone declaring a relationship within the US or anyone taking car if "unaccompanied " minors..really...why would you sign this debacle.. close it down first!
no This is what the demonrats call a manufactured crisis..
no Nora Arevalo it is rather difficult to hand dig a tunnel. Have you considered that?  Have you thought about how long it would take. Do you think or just spout Democratic talking points?
yes Art Jackson  Dear... The problem of immigrants before the elections before 2016... The problem is outdated... But at the beginning of 2017... Congress was Republican... The wall and its problems will not affect the 2020 elections... Like now... On the contrary it will be positive... and other things...
no Once a border wall of any real size is installed and paid for,  it is just about cost free.  Think of just how much the Border Patrol agents cost, drones, electronic surveillance, and the like.  They are a continuing expense, and maintenance cost.  BUILD THE DAMN WALL, NOW.
yes Gary Masters  Oh, go cry in your koolaid.
yes #FUCKTRUMP
no I hope he goes ahead and does it!
no Adam Somerville  Is a moron
yes Lynn Limauro Floyd A white guy drove drunk and killed my uncle. We need to deport white people too!
no What about the five people yesterday??? Let's declare emergency on gun control!!!!
no I support you  100 percent ,those opposed are being led like sheep unto slaughter!
yes If a wall would have saved your daughter and you have proof of that, I am with you. But most illegals come through ports or overstay their visas. Money spent on securing those areas would most certainly help and had a better chance of helping your daughter.
no I also believe President Trump will dedicate his second term to draining the swamp as promised, which in my opinion is brilliant
yes Keith has an ART degree.
no Down on the border where we live, IT IS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY.  BUILD THE WALL.
yes It's like a stop sign. How many die b4 installing the damn sign.
yes And make Trump properties use it..how many Illegals did Trump have at his facilities?
no Heres one cherry picked example to prove a stupid point. How many thousands of people die from cars every week? Lets outlaw them! How many people die from gun violence? Lets confiscate them all! Obesity? Forced dietary restrictions for the overweight!
no Behind you 100 % illegal. immigrants need to come in the right way . Democrats need to wake up on this issue. And the drugs that are comming in.
yes trump's uneducated, low-IQ base is triggered by stories like this that ignore the facts. Illegal immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than native-born Americans, and a wall would do nothing to stop the flow of illegal drugs. There is no "crisis" at the border. Illegal crossings are at historic lows.
yes Shirley Wilson and I must tell you our VA does suck....being ran by folks with no experience and don't care.Son just retired from AF,was in the whole show last 25 yrs....he has a state job working in fraud division and our VA is in shambles.The wall should take a backseat to our problems at this time....drugs are gonna get here,workers will be hired by the wealthy,and things will continue till our mind set of helping others instead of putting up walls physically or metaphorically change.Its all realative.I hope you have found peace.
no My heart and prayers go out to all you Angel families. So glad the President honoured acknowledged you
no And i agree with you
no DEMOCRATS / TREASON
yes The President declared a  National Emergency then went Golfing?!? Trump is a Bad Joke - an Irresponsible Scumbag!!
no Jones Jebaraj there are shootouts in America by white conservative men . What will you do for that.. oh yes build more mental.institutions
yes Keith Nance well guess what. It isn't. Trump proposed a 19th century steel wall. We need to utilize a 21st century solution that will both cost less and be better at securing the border.
yes DUI ended you daughter's life,  not someone's citizenship.
yes I illegal murder to many ,keep Americans safe from ppl that aren't supposed to be here.
yes is not the wall , we need the money for the next election , people are die of cancer every day and you think illegal are the problem
no Tommy Carpenter  There is a question mark about her status when she was doing her original porno shots. She might not have had the right visa for that. Also when she got her final visa she did so with a so-called Einstein visa which is supposed to be reserved for people who are exceptional in their line of work.
yes Kelly Preiss Wilhelm white, black, asian, latino gang shootings,...you have no clue...take a look at percentages of race to murders.....why just blame white...all races do it....even women
no @Cancel President Day ... until we get a ligitimate one!
no Heaven has walls the great wall of China works well too.#factsudemdummycrats
yes Never happened. More trump lies.
no BUILD THE WALL.
no https://joinkgm.co/r/Morishey
yes Trump and his friends believe in voter suppression and billionaires buying elections. We want Automatic voter registration, the overturn of Citizens United and Election day as a national holiday. History is on our side. We will win this struggle
yes You retards are making this orange sack of cum think he's the best president ever . . Stop it !
no Richard Paff Agree
yes my condolences.  thanks for having the where with all to foster yourdaughters memory by putting forth your feelings on this subject for the good of america
no Yes build the wall sooner rather than later
yes Just makes me so angry that our government turns a blind eye to american's and kisses the ass of illegal's just for there illegal vote. How can they even say this is a made up. I would never wish this on anybody but they just might have to walk in the shoe's of a family that lost a loved one when it could have been Prevented!.
yes Democrats have no concern for the victims of ILLIGAL entry into this country and the outcomes such as this; even as saddening as it is. It's all about stopping ANY progress of this presidency - even though he's done more FOR this country and its people, citizens and the hopefuls - of ALL ethnic backgrounds ---- than ANY previous potus in the history of MOST current living generations today; if not EVER  !!! DEMS campaign on open borders, abolish ICE, catch and release, NO voter ID, sanctuary cities, raising taxes, aborting babies up to the day of birth - moments AFTER birth in Virginia, they NOW have TWO in Congress that were sworn in on the Quran instead of the HOLY BIBLE and since then - they've (DEMS) removed the phrase "so help me God" FROM the oath - to better accommodate or """NOT OFFEND""" their future colleagues.  And some people don't even understand the dangers, mindset and future intentions of "The RADICAL ISLAMIC DEMOCRATIC TERRORIST PARTY"... Wake up people.
yes Acataphasia Grey , the one about the drunk driver that hit and killed the teacher is not a joke. I Googled it. This man was illegal. His papers were not real. He was drunk, hit her, killed her and ran.
no Sources?
yes Carl Ostendarp at least he didn't have a big party and our boys in bengezi wasn't important enough for him or hillary to try and get them help! i call  BS BS BS at least the man does answer when called no matter where he is.
no A drunk driver that was previously DEPORTED, which then made it a felony to come back. Was re arrested, but STILL out drinking and driving.
yes It may lessen the human flow but there are other ways to manipulate the system
no The problem is Americans, not immigrants. This country was built on immigrants coming here to have better jobs and be able to be who they want to be.  Everyone who disagrees with that is disgraceful to our ancestors. They might as well spit on their graves.
no Mary Larkin and Ted Bundy killed a lot of white girls too.  What is your point.
yes There is no such things as "Gun Violence" or "manmade climate change", both are made up crisis! guns do 3 things, they fire, they fail and they rust, hate is in  the heart and you cannot legislate that! Finally it isn't a damned competition you witless troll, illegal border jumpers are not supposed to be her at all, FULL STOP!  By your logic because we have an epidemic of social violence brought on by liberal ideologies, we should let in more criminals?! You really are a special kind of stupid!
no Thank you Mr president for helping us Americans.
yes https://twitter.com/RespondTrump
yes Photoshop
no What is wrong with Country ? this is a no brainier - secure our country - keep safe our people
yes Why havent you pushed for the northern wall yet??
no When people post this do they ever think about the domestic terrorism that happens here all the time daily?
no Mike V. Radatti more Americans are killed by fellow Americans with guns than anything else including drugs from over the Mexican border and illegals put together
yes Really ! What planet did you float in from
yes Many thanks , and prayers go out to cover you with the full suit armor of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior .
yes If the Dems can't see how needed the wall is... then how can we ever trust them with anything (we as) Amaricans would ever need at all?
yes You're never gonna convince Democrats who are mentally ill.
no Danny Jones Ive always wondered why GB joined the EU, they were stable without them. Good luck to you
yes Kent Wojahn and lets it forget- these things that still need addressing- NEEDED addressing during Obamas tenure as well!
yes Tim Masters
no Greetings President Trump theirs 250 resurvations circumferencing the united states,
no Trump is right but everyone wants a different agenda which it's a bad one
no Ryan Lawes Cameron Oviatt yeah murica pew pew
yes Mr. President, your signing of this Omnibus Bill that is complete garbage is the first thing you've done while in Office that makes me wonder "what the hell were you thinking?".  You should have laughed in their faces when they put this crap in front of you. And all to prevent another shutdown? Maybe those folks shouldn't have taken a "non-essential position"!
yes Dont give up, Mr. President. Thank you for trying to protect our country.
yes An Indianapolis colt was killed by one
no Not happy for their loss. So devastating    Glad only they support trump
yes Build the great wall america
no #BUILDTHEWALL #NICEANDTALL
yes Everybody cares about his or her own self, but as a president his primary aim suppose to be putting the  needs of the masses first before considering his own need because without the masses who voted for him he will not be in that seat.
yes Keith Webber Jr.  ahh ha yet the Dems think they have a fight lol wow
no George Winn not dems fault Trump lies and makes up statistics that contradict government agencies to justify his wall.  What happened to Republicans being fiscally responsible?  Also not the Democrats fault Trump was planning this all along but decided to make over a million Americans suffer before declaring his emergency.
yes Im so sorry about the loss of your daughter!  I  totally support President Trump and the building of this wall.
no God bless America
yes Guns kill many more, why isn't that an emergency?
yes Deport all Americans you must be including yourself then
yes Yeah i can see how touched you are demonrat  you are so blind by the fake news media and by the demonrat party that you can't see how much things he has accomplished
yes Dear Mr. President Trump, At first, I was a bit skeptical about having a business man run for president when I believed you had little knowledge of politics. Then you began to open my eyes to the corruption that as been in the White House for far too long. Like all business men, your main concern is to protect the company which he has invested into (that being the people of the USA). If walls don't work, then why do we fence in our backyards? (To protect our children from the known dangers of the outside world.) Why do we fence in cattle when it seems inhumane to force an animal to a restricted area? (To protect the investment of their owners and others from harm). Why do we fence in our public schools? (To protect innocent children from savage people who wish unnecessary violence against the future of America). Why do we build retaining walls around our house? (To stop mother nature from destroying our shelter, our home). Why do we build walls around freeways and areas of high traffic? (To protect each other from the negligence of other drivers and to protect our people from hit and runs). Why do we build railings on our bridges? (To protect people from the dangers of failing far far below). Your interest is direct and logical. Let's protect the American people from the dangers of our Southern boarder before the danger/crime/violence happens (Still a little late because there are many of Americans who have lost love ones due to not having a wall). Democrats are doing everything in their power to stop you, don't let them! They are after the votes of the illegals, not the protection of their citizens! You sir will most likely be the greatest president in my lifetime. Opening America's eyes one day at a time. Wake up or fall victim to the violence and destruction the Democratic party wants. Keep fighting for the American people, it's been a honor to have you for a president sir!!! #TRUMP2020
yes so agree, get it built.
yes Wake Up America.
no The wall is just a distraction for Drumpfs dwindling base. Drumpfs 2016 campaign chairman Paul Manafort, attended a pre-sentencing hearing for his crimes this week. The recommendation was for him to serve between 19-24 years. His sentence was increased due to his continued lying about the contacts between the Russian government officials and his campaign team. Why would the 69 year old continue to lie and inevitably choose to die in prison? Keeping his boss out of it and hoping for a presidential pardon perhaps. I dont know but Special Counsel Robert Mueller does. 
yes Walls  work  IF  they  are  prison  walls  with  the  required  human  resources.  May  you  know  such  in  your  lifetime.
yes America first because it's the right thing to do.Best President ever.
no Babi Nikki That was the most ignorant comment yet. You need to learn some American history . My grandmother immigrated from Ireland the correct way. We as a nation have laws and they are to be upheld to protect our Country. All you have is what you regurgitate from the liberal socialist side. Educate yourself before you post comments.
no I think that's how the natives yielded too, when you invaded them.
no Dont forget the Sheriff that was killed in California by an illegal immigrant which the Governor completely ignores.
yes Babi Nikki So sorry for your loss and the added grief put  on you from our broken immigration laws.  I do hope that sharing your son's story will save someone else's life.  I also apologize  for Babi Nikki.  She can say such cruel things but not brave enough to use her real name.
no Tony Palmer  I but it would prevent massive drug influx and criminals from entering
no So sorry.Solution : wall+deportation
yes We have needed Walls for over 30 years, Thank you President Donald Trump
no Betty Bilbrey Yep.  The dems are pretending nothing is going on down here.  I just tell them to have another cup of covfefe and settle down.
yes And Americans dont drink and drive??   Its just the brown skin people who arent allowed to be criminals. White Americans, can be.
yes We know and agree The left is hateful and evil
yes Lisa Pursley when did they start the wall...
yes So another mass shooting happened yesterday and we have nothing to say about protecting innocent people from this?  Sad
no Close the bordes . Keep America safe .
yes And sadder yet, 4 people were shot and killed, 4 Police Officers wounded Aurora, IL in the weekly mass shooting. THAT IS AN EMERGENCY you Idiotic POtuS!
yes Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin 8.) Worker Development  ~ Established a National Council for the American Worker to develop a national strategy for training and retraining Americas workers for high-demand industries.  ~Employers have signed Trumps Pledge to Americas Workers, committing to train or retrain more than 4.2 million workers and students.  ~Signed the first Perkins CTE reauthorization since 2006, authorizing more than $1 billion for states each year to fund vocational and career education programs.  ~Executive order expanding apprenticeship opportunities for students and workers.
yes When an immigrant kill 1 person white citizens have already killed 10, I guess whites never wanna lose,  always on the lead on everything specially when it means killing innocents.  Facts from history
no A warrior??? I think NOT! He has bone spurs, remember.
no Mike Charles Im the only one posting facts and figures collected by research organizations.  Please feel free to post the information you guys have backing up your understanding of illegal immigration.  Also Im not sure how this has anything to do with Republicans or Democrats. This is about what is the most effective tool to deal with illegal immigration and understand the actual statistics put forth by those who study illegal immigration.
no Good please also drain the swamp on processes food and get it out of the markets before it kills more American Families go strong on FDA  and keep them legit as it seems they are approving poison
yes The whole wall not just a little piece of it the whole wall
no Tick-tick-tick
no Did Acosta go and talk to the angel family's after his episode and nonsense questions??
yes Why don't you stay focused, to damn stupid
no Same with all of us Americans who have lost family members to gun violence. Not one word ever said by Donny about that.
no Ur great Pres Trump ... watching from Vienna
yes How many schools shooting have there been
no Trump is a fear-mongoner.  Unite US - what a joke

no Kyle Callender ....Control laws TAKE lives......  The more guns in civilian hands equals less crime and safer communities.  Every year in the US guns are used millions of times to stop criminal actions.  By contrast a relatively few innocent people are killed with one.
no if someone breaks into your home, does that make them an illegal resident or a criminal? 
yes Looking forward to you in prison, traitor.
yes BUILD THE DAM WALL
yes May her memory be a blessing
no whoever denies that wall will work is an idiot with an agenda in collution with the drugs cartel of Mexico
no there it is, the dumbest thing you'll see all week
yes Ban alcohol. Ban cars. Ban guns. Ban breathing. All of those things result in death.   PS: If you served in the military and have the balls to message someone else about their opinions on Facebook, don't block them before they have the chance to reply. You were probably in the reserves anyway, not active duty. Fucking Call of Duty couch warrior.
no I can only see the notification and youre misinfor,  try again.  Im sure its nonsense.  But  before you do, look up who is doing the killings.  Im not misinformed
yes Gabriel Urea what is your point
no You are a heartless human.  I hope you never have to feel the pain of losing a loved one. He made a bad decision to drink and drive. He shouldn't have been  here in the first place and of story. They may never get justice for their daughter and that's so sad.
no David Thoreson and the president would NOT respond for OUR safety
yes The wall will fix drinking and driving?.........
no I agree we must build the wall, but how can we ignore this dude has a fucking 10 head. Lookin like jimmy neutron all grown up
no American citizens have killed 4 of my friends and 2 family members what we doing about that
no Go for it trump
no Everybody knows Trumps right! Just a bunch of babies raising hell for the sake of raising hell!
yes Kenny Shuster no America says so.  If you want to keep on supporting the illegals invite them to your house
yes Awesome idea. Whos going to take your place?
no We'll wait Curtis. Let us know how you fare. Just kidding. We don't care. Just GTFO.
no Its incomprehensible that Americans are actually fighting against keeping illegals out. What part of illegal do they not understand?
no And your point is? Every little bit helps.
yes Wall wont stop it from happening.
no You'd actually have to start it before you can finish it ;)
yes Release the babies stop family separation
no Im sorry for your loss
yes Hello Mr Wall Trump
no Safer
yes Dovid Staples They do want to ban mental problem people from having guns.
yes In my personal experience I have been assaulted by good old fashioned God-fearing Southern boys 3 times.  Your opinion does not invalidate my personal experience. Please tell me about your experiences as a lesbian.
no Another murder on the hands of the democrats
no Tracy Driskell that might get you 30 days!
yes Build that f*cking wall! We the people stand behind you Mr.President!
yes They need to make a trench along the wall on r side about 10ft deep and 10ft wide, fill with rattle snake and when they go over or under well; let just say the snakes will welcome them to the USA!!!! LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
yes Sorry and sad for your lost we definitely need to man up with the wsll
yes Joseph Nowik , ask Obama, he started it.
yes Walls work , thats why we all have one around our houses! Make complete sense!
no Yes sir for sure
yes Those that live in gated communities tell us walls dont work.  Those that have armed bodyguards tell us we should not own firearms.  Those that have worn blackface condemn us for asking them about it.
no Democrats are power hungry socialist traitors that don't care about dead American citizens.  They care about votes, and destroying core values of the country, like democracy and capitalism.
yes 5 people died yesterday out of a machine gun in illinois that's the emergency Mr President assault weapons,your border emergency is crap made up in your head
no 20% of illegal immigration comes in through Mexico, and a wall won't stop half of that.  Logical legislation is need, not a stupid wall.
yes Build that wall.   Cost doesnt matter  Life is Priceless
no Betsy Hammond How much would the money HUSSAIN  SENT TO IRAN BUY????
yes Its is his highest priority! Even one murder is over the line. Even for one the wall must go up!
yes BUILD IT NOW...I DON'T GIVE A DAMN WHERE THE MONEY HAS TO COME FROM...GET IT AND USE IT ON THE WALL!!! PEOPLE CAN COME IN THE "OLD FASHION" WAY...LEGALLY!!!
yes Sue Howie just like obama with his shutdown
yes So Veronica where exactly did this happen ?
no the arrigance of the left in idealizing illegal immigrants as good citizens who just want to fit in and find a better life for their family. i should note, however, that probably most people killed by drunk drivers were the victims of American citizens. I know of a couple of cases, and it is just as bad if the killer is an American. If the laws were enforced better or were stricter these tragedies could be reduced. We should not focus solely on illegal immigrants for crimes that are widely committed by non-illegals. That is no excuse for illegals, however, it is just how things are.
no I am so sorry for your loss.  I will be praying for you all.  Thank God for our President who will build the wall.
yes Why do you believe that being killed by an illegal immigrant is somehow worse than being killed by citizen - which happens with far more frequency? In Texas, where we keep statistics on these things, citizens commit violent crimes at higher rates than  illegal immigrants. Wed be better off deporting citizens. (Which ICE sometimes tries to do.)
no Bruh your like 400 years old. There was no wall when u were born.
yes Too bad it wasn't PELOSI'S or Schumer's kid...sad for these parents
yes Emily Neal lmfao you ever heard of Chicago? Look it up ! One if the safest cities in America with the strictest gun laws around!
yes It must be  a Federal Emergency. Trump is playing golf.
yes THANK YOU 4 caring enough to do something 4 the Citizens & Immigrants that came here LEGALLY.   Obama sent Billions 2  " other " countries 4 borders,  well now WE need protection 4 ours !     ILLEGAL still means ILLEGAL !!!
no Democrats are planning on suing because of the wall. Why can't those Americans who have been victims, lost their love ones by illegals place a lawsuit against them? If our boarders were secure, these innocent Americans would have never lost their lives!
yes Liberals are crazy nutty dumbass people
yes Clause 7 Clause 7. No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.
no A car accident killed my granddad. May as well ban cars. See how fucking stupid your logic is?
yes Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin 9) Health Care  ~Signed an executive order to help minimize the financial burden felt by American households Signed legislation to improve the National Suicide Hotline.  ~Signed the most comprehensive childhood cancer legislation ever into law, which will advance childhood cancer research and improve treatments.  ~Signed Right-to-Try legislation, expanding health care options for terminally ill patients.  ~Enacted changes to the Medicare 340B program, saving seniors an estimated $320 million on drugs in 2018 alone.  ~FDA set a new record for generic drug approvals in 2017, saving consumers nearly $9 billion.  ~Released a blueprint to drive down drug prices for American patients, leading multiple major drug companies to announce they will freeze or reverse price increases.  ~Expanded short-term, limited-duration health plans.  ~Let more employers to form Association Health Plans, enabling more small businesses to join together and affordably provide health insurance to their employees.  ~Cut Obamacares burdensome individual mandate penalty.  ~Signed legislation repealing Obamacares Independent Payment Advisory Board, also known as the death panels.  ~USDA invested more than $1 billion in rural health care in 2017, improving access to health care for 2.5 million people in rural communities across 41 states Proposed Title X rule to help ensure taxpayers do not fund the abortion industry in violation of the law.  ~Reinstated and expanded the Mexico City Policy to keep foreign aid from supporting the global abortion industry.  ~HHS formed a new division over protecting the rights of conscience and religious freedom.  ~Overturned Obama administrations midnight regulation prohibiting states from defunding certain abortion facilities.  ~Signed executive order to help ensure that religious organizations are not forced to choose between violating their religious beliefs by complying with Obamacares contraceptive mandate or shutting their doors.
no Joseph Roy ...Kris Landers missing the whole point. Plain and simple..this person should not be in this country. What part of illegal does she not understand? End of the day this young ladies life is gone as a result of an illegal immigrants action. Nothing petty about that.
yes MR President, I would be honored to serve as security for our country on the border.
yes Keep our children safe... build the wall!!!
no Come on America!  Not nearly enough shares of this post! Do not expect the MSM to spread the information, they have a different agenda. If you Love it, Share it!
no I am so very sorry for your loss!
no Build the wall. Move on. Use drug money held in escrow. These drug lords are in jail, on the run, or dead. If the ACLU doesnt like it, build a wall around them.
no Betsy Hammond We spend $150 billion per year on illegal immigrants welfare. Even if wall only stopped half of it, that's $75 billion per year that can go towards the things you speak of. Can you imagine how far that can go? WOW!!!! You're not just real bright are you?
yes Jordan Miller have you ever thought about the fact that the driver was drunk? He was obviously going very fast if he hit her that hard and some terrains make it hard to see when people are coming down the street. Shame on you for having absolutely no soul and saying it was her fault.
no Stay strong Mr. President. We the people still support you. Thank you for standing up for us.
no Betsy Hammond  I am a diabetic I pay for insurance and still have to pay for it!!! I still want the wall and back my President!  He is NOT to blame for the high insurance costs thank Obama the worthless one He did that to you NOT Trump!!! So jump on Obamas page and let him k ow how you struggle. Trump works for FREE for Americans he can only fix things obama destroyed so fast
yes Danny Jones One angel family does not a crisis make!!!!  Trump declares national emergency...  Nobodys done the job that weve done on the border,  said Donny as he declares a national emergency today........the slowest emergency in history.  And with the lawsuits that will ensue, his wall will not be funded or built until after the next election...if ever.  THE WORLDS SLOWEST EMERGENCY!!!!!  Donny lied directly to Americans about his border crisis.  Our Liar-in-Chief said that all the data that refutes his crisis designation is lies.  Got that?  Our president told the American people that THE FACTS ARE LIES...this is what all wannabe dictators say.  This egomaniac is THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!  Donny doesnt seem terribly concerned about this crisis.  He plans to travel to Florida mere hours after declaring the emergency from the White House. A president, in times of strife, would typically stay in the nations capital to oversee the crisis. Donny plans to do so from the comfort of his weekend getaway.  In reality, Donny is preparing the country for a fake war as he plans to enjoy a mini vacation. The only national emergency in America right now is one of leadership!!
yes Yes, build the Wall.
no Chuck Brantley  You're the one lowering your standards by attacking and calling names. It's apparent that's all you got. Most adults would be embarrassed to act in such a childlike manner. Same with Lyle, maybe you'll mature enough some day to hold an adult conversation.
no what? smh
yes So sorry ! We need the WALL! We Need Immigration Over-haul
no Where do u get info?CNN???
yes Thank you ! I appreciate everything you do !
yes Dale Murphy Im sorry you dont care. Thanks for sharing your opinion on executive overreach with a clever gif.
no It's called Checkmate!!!
no But if that illegal immigrant wouldn't have been here...
no I was injured in a car accident caused by an illegal immigrant. 13 years later I still have mobility issues because of it. A couple months before, a cop who was a member at my church was shot and killed during a routine traffic stop. He was murdered by a kid who was deported 9 times. He left behind a wife and infant. I am a supporter of the wall! Thank you Trump!
no The most irrational view
no Amen!  Build that wall!
yes We would not need walls if we were not in the need of penitentiary terms !!
no Well I wont be a politician later but yeah it was obviously a statement on the president priorities. Gun control might be a bigger problem in the US considering the thousands of deads it could save every year. But I guess now it's all about our opinions, values and interpretations of the stats about each of these issues
yes if the Senators and the state doesn't want the wall built let's put their houses down there along the border it for the governors in the Senators to live in and then let's see if they want to build the wall
no Del Cueto added that he wants a secure border for the same reason people lock their doors at home:  "Because we love the people inside, not because we hate the people outside," he said.
no Troops do not view immigration as a national emergency. Not even close. 60 percent of active-duty troops say immigration is either a small threat to U.S. national security or no threat at all. Likewise, 77 percent view Mexico as a small threat or none whatsoever. VoteVets.org
no seim of y ramp yar migrant tu
no Priorities
yes Perry Hess sure lol most republiCONS are gun owners not dems retard
yes Dear Mr. Trump, millions of soldiers including 58,000 Americans who died in the Vietnam war.  We are suffering from the brutality of communist 's regime.  Please help to free us.  We want FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHS FOR VIETNAM, Please!
no Sorry for your lost build the wall
yes Tony Connelly I agree with you. Between medical issues, underinsured/uninsured people not being able to afford medication and medial attention they need and gun violence due to untreated mental illness we have a real crisis.   If we want to stop most illegal immigration we just need to start putting the people who hire them in jail. it doesn't even have to be long, it could be as short as 30 days. however this would put a concrete consequences behind hiring an illegal.
no Trump ur just as bad as cnn. Lets remind the worl how many Americans ate people and buried people . Also many more evil crimes. Lets build a wall is like locking us all in a cell with these American killers. The kkk set nonwhites on fire and tied them to a tree but there able to roam free . Good one trump
yes Albert J Destefanis he is the swamp
no Hey like the dems say about guns, if we save one life it's worth it.  
yes Her father is the one who said to not use her death for political reasons....
yes I SUPPORT ALL YOUR EFFORTS MR. PRESIDENT. GOD BLESS YOU.
no Mr. President Trump  ....... Now is the time. Our Great and Loving Country is THE PLACE, and our people before politics are the United States of America ...THIS is the STAND against treason, tyranny and TIME against us. It's your move Sir.
yes The Berlin Wall worked really well
no Lol
yes Pewlosi is the pockets of the Mexican drug cartels
yes A legal citizen shot and killed 5 Americans yesterday.
yes U might want to look at your gun problem as something requiring the recognition of a national emergency before letting a wall jump the que... u do know thats not the only way they get in?
no If that wall saves one person it will be worth every penny!!   #buildthewall
no If Trump had used the reversed theory, walls don't work, let's take them down, the democrats would have the entire wall done by now. They know they work, but they can't agree with him on anything. So sad.
yes Never Never a Wall
no Dave Thompson Yes they are Americans.  South Americans to be precise.  But they are NOT UNITED STATES  CITIZENS!  They are CITIZENS of the country they came from and chose to come here ILLEGALLY.  They should have done it the RIGHT way.  APPLY for CITIZENSHIP!!!
yes Did Daniel Zuniga illegally cross the border on foot in an area we dont currently have walls or come here legally and over stay their Visa?
no Why isn't 40,000 Americans killed by handguns alone last year count as a national emergency/ Why isn't 340 mass shootings last year a national emergency?
yes I hate to say it, if this happened to a couple of liberal politicians family members we would see action!
yes I wouldn't call it a crisis, but a major concern that should have been dealt with decades ago. But it's funny how the Democrats flipped suddenly on their debate tactics for this issue. Any other issue and they dig deep and pull out all the unique tragedies and cry about how terrible it is for this one person, so we should change society just for them. However, Trump decides to play the emotion card and he's called a liar and every other name in the book. He's playing the game they invented. What poor sports.
yes Thank you Mr President/Vice for protecting the AMERICAN Citizen. What can we do end the attacks of those anti trumpers.
yes I have lived in the Rio Grande Valley my entire life. Live about 10 minutes from Mexico, never had any issues with illegal aliens. Trump made it a point to exclude all the local mayors from his border visit. Mayors from Brownsville, Harlingen and McAllen are all against this wall, as well as I. Creating a crisis, where there isnt one! More people have died by the hands of homegrown mass murdering terrorists than illegal aliens! No wall for me please!
yes Ed Basler how many of those are big pharmaceuticals fault?
no Cert
yes Sueli Rossi  - you can't trust the Dems, but you believe every word that comes out if 45's mouth when almost everything he says can be be easily proven to be a lie? Now that's a special kind of stupid.
yes God bless you Donald Trump. In Nigeria my country, the president value cows more than humans, the reason why we want him out.
yes stop using people
no CNN, hired by Democrats, insists on trying to ruin White House's fervent campaign for the construction of the wall on the border, CNN has never praised anything positive made by US President Donald J. Trump, or supported the conquest in the American economy, has always tried to campaign against any measure approved by the American people. The Wall should be built not to prohibit new immigrants in America, it's on the contrary, the Wall should be built to open doors for legal immigrants who want to live in America, following rules and conditioning themselves to live on the American flag in law and constituent order for good citizens. Build the Wall.
no Hal Eric Mitlitsky Trump is above you
yes Renee ladd magee you've been watching too much Fox news, there is nowhere in Europe that has sharia law. I live in a uk city which has a large ethnic community, and you it has problems but its problems driven by unemployment and low paid jobs not what race or which god someone follows. Do not the US have the same issues in its inner cities ?
yes we don't , we just know spending $25 BILLION on a wall will  NOT stop people entering the country illegally ,  most illegals are visa over stayers but trump is not addressing that he just wants a wall to keep votes off morons like you two
yes Larry Martin nope
yes God bless you President Trump! Trump 2020
no Stephen King they do its called jail lots of fencing and Wall!!!
yes https://www.axios.com/us-budget-deficit-spikes-fiscal-year-1e946342-c3bd-4ae0-892b-fb9747580277.html?fbclid=IwAR0_r933rSW2fq1va1fy9GkcaST_ieZjhw7kfjZrVtkmNLZPT8B1rNpqXOw
no Shut your lying ass up.
yes Many years ago, a friend of mines step brother was killed in a car accident by an illegal. He fled to Mexico. Never was caught
no That and distracting from the Russian thing.
no Not even a shoe of the wrong size will fit by force
no ^^^* 'We'; {average American citizen's}... need to bring light to EVERY occurrence of an; 'Illegal Alien' murdering a 'American Citizen'.  And then make sure that the entire World knows.  That 'IT' 'IS' the unequivocally /and/ specifically that 'FAULT' of; 'Nancy Pelosi' / 'Chuck Schumer' /and/ Anyone that did not vote to fund the 'Border Wall'!!!!!!  *Through Their neglect... have the Blood of innocent people on Their hands!!!!!!! :'(  *> When will They {Liberal's} be prosecuted for; 'Complicit Neglect in conjunction of a Homicide'!?!?!?! >:(
yes No trump is wrong and he can not be trusted to tell the truth any longer. Thousands of Illegal immigrant's cross the boarder at our check points every week right now, it just takes cash and a connection, a longer wall in the desert will not help at all.
yes What a waste of money...... Wake up folks!
no WE support you, President Trump...and do not want to see any more people in America become Angel Moms and Dads!
yes Craig Peterson what American problems because of Americans.  Hmmmmmm?
no https://www.facebook.com/roguepressbriefs/photos/a.219075375254770/550355752126729/?type=3&theater
no Haha,you would date Ivanka if she wasnt your daughter,give me a fricken break
yes John Steele The real question is Does Mexico love God, isnt it? God answers prayers to those who pray.
yes this is happening WAY too often!
yes Emil Drr he's not going to prison, it will be too full of Obama and his entire administration.
yes Nice God blass You famly
yes Mr. Trump you're a beautiful Angel of the Lord with hair as Golden as my Sunrise.
yes Yes Mr Trump. Protect Americans first. Even the Dumbacraps that can only Take from the American people. Then lets move on to more issues like big pharma and infrastructure. One thing at a time. You have 6 more yrs and its going to be a battle with the obstructing we know.
no BUILD THE WALL! Up Pelosi's ass with a piece of glass!!!!
no https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/why-wall-wont-work
no Exactly. Or the 5 shot dead in Illinois yesterday.
yes Yesterday in Aurora IL American citizen killed 5 people and wounded couple more including police officers. So I can suggest a wall between every single county
yes Sheikh F Shahel Obama declared countless NEs only to help other countries. He is detrimental to the U.S. I was never outlandish or butthurt like you scumbag liberals are towards Trump.. I kept my mouth shut for 8 long years.. Maybe you should try that too
yes No border...no country ! Walls work! So, so sorry for your loss! Prayers go out to you and your family! Thank God we have a strong, courageous  President  in President Trump  who loves all Americans and our Beloved Counrty. He saved our Country!  #TRUMP2020  #WAWY
no Darrel James Be more specific? White,black, male,female,young,old,etc?
no A $10B wall is worth more than a $4.5B pipeline that doesn't exist. What can it hurt?
no Justin Fields   Sorry, Justin!!!   PRESIDENT TRUMP, THANK YOU FOR PUTTING AMERICA FIRST ON EVERY DECISION YOU MAKE!!!!! 
yes Does God not like Mexico then? Is he only helping America?
no They won't even meet with the angel parents.
no Weo is it to much for a politician to do what he said he was gonna do
no I don't understand why no one (including President Trump, media, etc) never use the fact that there are caravans of people headed for our southern border with the intentions of entering our country one way or the other.  To me, that alone is a crisis in itself!
yes Jimmy Kimmel has walls around his house but yet the piece of trash talks crap about our great president!! Trump 2020...
yes Kimberly Mansfield  there is NO gun problem, it is a people problem. People have no respect for others, authority or human life.
yes The house will fall
yes Rob Egerton right on that abortions kill thousands a day.
yes What are we going to do with our home grown terrorists?
yes Correction:. Protection for American WHITE CHRISTIAN RICH families are your priority.
no Sheep
yes If you build a wall, illegal immigrants will come with a boat. And boat owners will make huge money by human trafficking, some poor illegal immigrant children will die by drowning, because boat owners will receive more people than the capacity. Another drama will start. Do you really want this? In other countries this is happening. wall is not the solution..
no Danny Jones your culture must be trash.    Why are you garbage humans?
yes Yolanda Copac like trump worked with others LOL he shut the government down like the spoiled brat he is
no https://www.facebook.com/TheOther98/photos/a.115969958413991/2498507526826877/?type=3&theater
yes Thank you Mr Trump .for caring about the USA and its citizens. Build that Wall..and deport.
yes TRUMP IS AWESOME!
no I stand with you
yes Cant build the wall fast enough.
yes So true Democrats don't care at all for them self
yes Ed Wrany do you ever get tired of posting the same tired old bullshit sentence . He is the worst president ever, hands down. He's an idiot that is in over his head and he's driving us into disaster.  Wtf is wrong with drumpf turds? Were you dropped on your head as infants? Jezzzz....
no Estefania Torres Restrepo you aren't very bright are you. 94 percent of border agents, the head of the border union, the chief and 8 out of 10 border mayors all stated a wall helps. Please research before spewing ignorant rhetoric. Btw, I would be embarrassed if my heritage invaded a country where most don't speak English, have no skill, cost the American Tax Payers billions and wouldn't assimilate
yes Brandon Turner the wall is another tool we need and want. Would you rather us on the border shoot the trespassers?
no Prayers for everyone who have lost loved ones because of illegal aliens. This is absolutely insane. Thankfully, I don't know anyone who has been harmed by an illegal but I am still for the wall. Walls are good. Walls help with many things. The people against to wall are - well, I won't put it in print - but one day it's going to affect them and we'll see how their opinion is then. So many people hate this president more than they love their country. God bless the friends and family affected and God bless our president and those trying to help.
yes So horrible!!  100%!!  Build the wall!
yes Their kids are already brain dead
yes Lies...... Lies...... Lies...........
no Larry Lubiner why?? Because it's true?
yes Because are people too
yes Or she could have been at the VEGAS outdoor concert. RIP
no https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2019/02/16/us/illinois-aurora-shooting/index.html
no https://youtu.be/u9UTTh6PPIg Only one ALLAH responds to his name.
no Mr T you are the best thing America has produced  Build the wall, right round America, no-one in, no-one out.  
yes Yes they will. Has anyone noticed Fox News is sounding more like CNN everyday?
yes That's our New way of life Now .  We open Season .  The wild Country of 1800's
yes YES BUILD THE WALL NO MORE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
no Eva Graham One angel family does not a crisis make!!!!  Trump declares national emergency...  Nobodys done the job that weve done on the border,  said Donny as he declares a national emergency today........the slowest emergency in history.  And with the lawsuits that will ensue, his wall will not be funded or built until after the next election...if ever.  THE WORLDS SLOWEST EMERGENCY!!!!!  Donny lied directly to Americans about his border crisis.  Our Liar-in-Chief said that all the data that refutes his crisis designation is lies.  Got that?  Our president told the American people that THE FACTS ARE LIES...this is what all wannabe dictators say.  This egomaniac is THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!  Donny doesnt seem terribly concerned about this crisis.  He plans to travel to Florida mere hours after declaring the emergency from the White House. A president, in times of strife, would typically stay in the nations capital to oversee the crisis. Donny plans to do so from the comfort of his weekend getaway.  In reality, Donny is preparing the country for a fake war as he plans to enjoy a mini vacation. The only national emergency in America right now is one of leadership!!
yes thats so stupid twat head libtard'
yes Bill Rahbine and what if your daughter was ever to get murdered by a illegal that's in a cartel ?  1 against .. what ? 50 thugs ? ... that wouldn't work out .
no KEEP US SAFE MR. PRESIDENT, BUILD THE WALL.
yes Thank you!!
no CBS newscasters needs to refer to our President as President Trump and not Mr. Trump. You dont have to like him but respect that he has the top position in the country.
yes TRUMP 2020
no Exactly sir
no Even the Mexican citizens don't want them and are telling them to go back where they came from...it is a problem...lots are unruly young men...the wall will at least funnel them to places they can be turned around...oh...congress fixed that...now they stay...but forgot the $$$ in that bill to care for and house the ones turned loose in our beautiful country...sad situation.
yes It is not an iligal immigrant, it is an illegal criminal that crossed our boarder. California state government should be charged with harboring these criminals. Take their statehood away and put them back in territory status.
yes I see this everyday hearing illegals tell me that the us pays there house cars and on food stamps.
no Ceilings work. Floors work. trump works for rich people.
no Linda Durbin TRAITOR TRUMP, PUTIN OWNED!!
no This makes my heart cry! Im behind building walls everywhere to keep out the gangs, the criminals and all people who enter illegally!
yes Five dead in Illinois by gun violence. Far more deaths each year by gun violence and drug abuse. But sure.... lets pretend a wall will solve it all.
yes Absolutely they work, BUILD THE WALL PRESIDENT TRUMP!
no The democrats dont care about the victims of crimes comited by illegals to Americans
no Christine M Terry you need you're head examed he will not get in for a second term he is trying too start a recession and that will cause a riot so shut up
no what nonsense stop using a rare event for fascism, may she rest in peace
yes We have the right to be protected, I'm sorry for your losses.....
no Isaiah 54:17
yes Alberto Weisz you cant take your door down but not because of illegal immigrants because of American citizens
yes A wall would not have kept this from happening. :/
yes My moms first husband was gunned down by a illegal machine gun, but I dont see yall taking gun violence on as seriously...
no We need the wall.
yes The government has no right telling a women what they should do with their bodies!
yes Stacey Britton you mean showing proof that we need border security?
no Tell that to Israel, their wall works just fine!
no Carl Ostendarp STFU -- obama went golfing 8min. after one of our journalists was beheaded .https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/22/us/politics/a-terrorist-horror-then-golf-incongruity-fuels-obama-critics.html
yes Curtis Rice Your stats are fake. We have the worst gangs from central America now because we are to free with our immigration polices.
yes We will still need to stop sanctuary cities and asylum laws so vote for people right and left who will change the laws
no Get that wall built, however you have to do it.  You have my vote in 2020.
no Mr President sir, how I wish the same energy and attention given to building walls are also channel on protecting American families through the amendment of GUN control laws. Problems are easier solved when tackled from the main source.
no If this were an anecdotal comment, I would disregard it.  However, this has happened to tens, nay, hundreds of people, even many thousands when one considers drug overdoses.  Stop illegal entry into our country!  Thank you President Trump.   Warm regards from south Florida.
no Anthony Clark maybe make your city and state do there jobs ?
yes President Trump build the wall!
no How do we feel safe from home grown slaughterers?
yes And the wall was there?
no Thank you Trump!
yes yeah, and hundreds if not thousands killed by gun nuts....but, crickets, ugh
yes America is truly a fucked up place. Thousands of Americans are shot by other Americans. You do nothing about gun control but are happy to spend millions to keep a handful of criminals out rather than deal with the ones youve already got.
no No your personal agenda has nothing to do with protecting American families - you just don't want to avoid standing out as a the loser you are and always will be. You simply don't have what it takes to be great - not even to make America great again. The only thing you have managed to make really great is America's debt of $21.97 trillion.
yes I support the President and the wall
no Simon Kitson I guess posing nude and marrying for money makes you smart
yes I live in McAllen, Texas. NO OTHER PRESIDENT has come here other than President Clinton, but all Clinton came here for was a fund raising event. THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP!!!
yes Hey Junior - what next? Burning books?  https://youtu.be/mpPaAUFNdNkDonald Trump Jr. Calls Teachers LOSERS At Rally With His Dadyoutube.com
yes Dale Murphy
yes Ed Barnat grow up.
yes BTW, he did not do this out of hate... he did it as a cost saving measure for his country.
yes God bless you Donald Trump.
no Jess Castrejn f@#& you ass hole
no BRAVO BURT LANCHESTER  BOMBER WHINCHESTER THE DUKE BIG JOHN MCCAIN
no Never in American history have elected officials, elected by Americans, fought so hard for people who are not Americans and didn't vote for them.  These are your Democrats today.  Disgusting and pathetic.
no I'm so sorry! :(
no What about the families of the 5 murdered in Aurora IL yesterday by an American?
yes we need the wall built it is a disgrace to the United States of America what has happened to the Democratic party they have destroyed their selves they are hypocrites and Liars the truth is coming out they tried to overthrow our government
yes Listen, Santa....
no Art Jackson please show me those facts.
yes Like all Presidents have said in the past, they can live here but do it legally. Why is that so hard to understand.
no We are with you President Donald J. Trump you are doing a great job.Please know that there are many of us who are praying for you!
no Yes build the wall.
no https://i.imgur.com/gfLTReH.png
no Maureen Hersey Brown you wouldn't because you have never been opressed, your people just stole and killed to get what the want.  The are not illegals, they are human beings, and God created them just as be created you.  You are not from this land dear so when you go back to Europe and make a comment it would be worth listening to until then, stfu.
no Daniel Alexander Allen  well said
yes I feel so very hurt for you.  The Wall will lessen the chances of such  a criminal to be on our streets .. Words can not comfort  you with such pain in your heart. But a Wall will prevent this in the future ...
no Dont you try and tell me there is no crisis at the border.
no BUILD THE WALL!!
yes It's not just about drugs and murders. It's about the fact people are coming in illegally. What is so hard to grasp about the word "ILLEGAL?"
no I'm for legal immigration ,and against illegal immigration .I don't know if the wall is good way to stop it . I do know if we imprisoned and fined employers that hire them, it would be more cost effective . After a few arrest and imprisonoment of employers , manager  , the rest of the employers will fall in line ,problem solved . This would be more humane, and much cheaper ,but neither party is willing to do anything about it because The US Chamber of Commerce has been able to lobby against the implemetation of e verify . Wall or no wall ,the truth is neither party really want to solve the problem and the wall is only a costly diversion
yes YES!!!
no Are you talking to your wacko birds, Trump? You think they'll swallow anything you say? You can't con all the people all the time."As a percentage of their respective populations, there were 56 percent fewer criminal convictions of illegal immigrants than of native-born Americans in Texas in 2015," author Alex Nowrasteh writes. "The criminal conviction rate for legal immigrants was about 85 percent below the native-born rate."
no Ed Wrany Worst and more corrupt president in 5e history of our country.
yes Charles Boyd JFC another delusional one who believes in the communist utopia of no guns except for the govt will keep us safe BS. Guess what- the govt doesnt give a damn about you. You are a liability to them and liabilities are expendable. Learn your history boy.
yes So far as I can tell, its only the democrats that does not want the wall. There are some that keeps asking me about it.
no God killed your daughter. He would have done it through any human.
yes When Democrats dismiss the fact that illegal immigrants are killing citizens , they are really admitting that there is an acceptable number of victims. I think they would feel differently if it were their family member who wound up a victim. That is completely unacceptable.
no I hardly think President Hoax should be praised for working hard playing golf and watching TV while neglecting his presidential duties!!!
yes Charles Gibson    We already have the BEST President protecting America.  We are a Nation of Laws....just like weve always had but previous presidents havent enforced.
yes Does any one else find the photo strange? The man doesn't even look human
yes Sad some think so little of innocent Americans
yes Protect us from Russia then jerk. And btw without illegals, you would never have any of your wife's or people cleaning your hotels and resorts idiot
yes I'm not saying building a wall is useless just saying they will find a way to get over it or under it. Just common sense that's all.
yes Sheikh F Shahel hello
no Larry Burford what does that have to do with this . So you want more killing to enter the US while we have enouph of our own . Juarez mexico is on the list of the most dangerous cities behind our border . You are really thinking crazy ! The border isnt even secure there either . If the walls come down they become part of our country . Think about that . They can walk right over .
no To quote liberals gun control mantra, ...if just one life is saved... but in this case the wall will actually be a net gain in saved lives.
yes So thankful for you
yes I'm so sorry for your loss!
yes fake news
yes Deport all immigrants they are all trouble we can do without.
yes Mr. Trump! destroy the deep state and build the wall!
no So sorry for your loss , and also the other parents who needlessly, have had their hearts broken , and families fractured !   
yes So it is a competition?! One is not as bad as the other?! It matters when some son-of-a-bitch guns you down?! What an asshat! What part of ILLEGAL ALIEN border jumper, who is not supposed to be here to begin with, do you not get?! As in if the illegals were not here they could not kill anyone you mental midget! This has to be the most ridiculous, stupid comment I have ever read!
no Then WHY on Earth did you sign that bill!
no PROPAGANDA!!!!!
no Chris Hall "if it saves one life it's worth it" does that mean you are also in favor of stricter gun control laws since it will save at least one life? What about the lives of baby immigrants that have died in the custody of the government? Will we end the practice of family separation to save those one lives as well? What about the asylum seekers that would die if not granted asylum into our country? Will we reform our asylum and immigration policies to save those one lives? You say a wall of it saves one life is worth it... then you should apply that principle equally to all lives.
yes Go camping at the border with your kid I dare you
no So sorry for your loss. We need walls!
no My heart weeps for them, and agree. Hopefully the people that El Paso is building units for, until they get processed won't be that. It's being told it's for Women and Children and the fact is that its more male than female or children. But you are all we got and you have the answers but sure don't agree with it but will back you...
no James Anderson or Australia? they banned guns no mass shootings since !!   infact none of the G20 have anything near our gun slaughter every week-why is that..  oh yes NO 2nd amendment....
no Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
no Victoria Deobald, Trump needs to explain why he didn't have Hillary arrested as he promised.  Instead, those who he surrounded himself with have been arrested jailed & sentenced.  This is the most corrupt White House in history!    75 INDICTMENTS
no Michelle Novak Clearly, my dear, they don't give a damn.
yes Yes use those poor unfortunate people for your corrupt political purposes. Meanwhile mass shootings go on daily all over the United States perpetrated by Americans.
yes My janitorial company sends MR,Trump money for the wall each month . We just made another donation today.   Praise the Lord! We have a president that cares.
no Your only priority is your own advancement and legacy.
no My sympathies.  I really wonder how Pelosi and the rest of the demorats live with themselves.  I guess they don't consider us to worth the worry.
yes Jess Castrejn MAD is a group who does address this #MOTHERSAGAINSTDRUNKDRIVERS.
yes Sam North Obviously we can keep out our own citizens idiot but we can keep out Illegals! Did you even read how stupid your post sounded before you posted it? Did you mom tell you as she put you on the little yellow bus every morning that it was for the smarter kids at your school Sam? Like wow?
yes Build a wall around DC instead
yes is reasonable gun control on your list?
yes The complicit media wants to cover this up
yes exactly and enough with this "undocumented workers" workers is hardly the word to describe them. ILLEGAL ALIENS is more appropriate and it was used without any problems for years.
yes Temicka Brown  Ok, done! Included your FB address and a pictures
no Joan Travis the amazing thing is all the previous real national emergencies received bipartisan support from Congress.
yes Thank you for your dedication and service to the American people.. we all ( except the crazy ones) stand behind you all the way... Blessings to you and your family always....
no We stand with you Mr.President.
no I do not understand people how do not want to see the huge problem here ? Scary and sad Build the wall MEGA 2020
yes Thank you, Mr. President!  
yes Liz fisher, don't be sorry for him I'm from the UK and he is talking rubbish
no It's hard to convince people who never had to felt it. Loosing something you were not suppose to. Do they need to see people they love die to understand that something isn't right?  To have saw it more than once, when it happen, YOU FUCKING CHANGES OF PERSPECTIVE. So now get the wall cause' lifes depent on it and you have all authority just look at all those case that the democrat CLEARY DON'T WANNA DEFEND.  But no problem defending illegal immigrants? And not building the wall?  IF YOU DON'T BUILD THE WALL THEN YOU CLEARY DONT LOVE THE US!
no So sorry for your loss it's not right that some one illegal can come into our country and take the lives of our own people!!  This is so wrong!!
yes I'm tired of illegals taking jobs from Americans for absolutely dirt cheap pay... The electrical field is hard work but people like my self are willing to work them. But we are tired of fixing their horrible work and not just bad, but dangerous work, not meeting the proper city codes...
no The best president ever #gotrump
yes Sorry about your daughter may she Rip
no Build the wall! Then throw all liberal progressive socialist democrats and all Islam on the south side of it.
yes And they have consequences.  They do get deported so they can come right back and do it again.  Maybe if we took care of Americans and focused on mental health, we could save some lives.  There's an idiot idea
yes Danny Jones you are so ignorant, we get more money back from the EU in trade and services than we ever put in, let alone in educational, scientific, defense, farming, policing and more cross border programs. The EU protects and enriches national identity and culture. And frankly if one day we can destroy dumb macho lad culture, the UK will be better off.
yes Jim LaMuth its Presidents Day weekend idiot. The real national emergency is that gay a*ss sweater your wearing
no An American citizen killed 17 kids in Parkland Fl,
yes Thank you.
no We owe it to her and all the others who's lives were snuffed out by people who didn't give a dang a out our laws. Let's build that wall!
yes So many lies from the habitual liar and charlatan that it's exhausting and hard to keep up.
yes Aint no damn illegal aliens gonna mess with my family or it will be the last thing they ever do. #DontMessWithMyFamily.
yes What's good for Democrats is bad for America...everybody knows this.Democrats are now an adversary of the U.S. and like any enemy of the U.S. they care nothing about National Security and Public Safety..
yes Just do it!
yes Jason O'neal  A lot just cross the desert, usually the really bad ones with records too
yes BTW, if we secure the 1900+ miles of open territory these border jumpers can just walk through, BP could focus more resources on tunnels! I had not heard that caravans of 10,000 invaders were coming in through the tunnels or landing at the airports! You asshat!
no God bless those whom we have lost due to no security at our boarder.  We have needed border security for 30 years and immigration reform to which nothing has never been done. This has been an emergency the entire time and no one had the wherewithal to do it. I COMMEND President Trump for finally taking action.    TRUMP 2020
yes It's better to look into this Trump.  Before things get out of hand
no Thank you Mr President.
no Jane Mitchell Why? Because the Fuhrer says so?!!
yes Take a good look at that. It's not just extreme christian humility. It's a world paradigm of caring and sharing.
no the only reason that the corrupt politicians are being allowed to destroy our country is because we are letting them..people have to wake up and get involved...congress will never pass any legislation that stops their corruption...if you are serious about wanting to drain the swamp then you need to get involved with the Convention of States. don't just leave everything to trump because the swamp is too deep for him to drain without our help.. please take the time to learn about the Convention of States and get involved... see Convention of States on facebook to learn more..please get everyone involved..
no Trump start out by saying lets build a wall. Are you a Trump supporters cheered him on. Now Trump is saying lets finish the wall. Again all you Trump supporters are cheering him on.   He hasnt even started to build the wall. But now you guys are cheering him on to finish it.  All Trump has to do is say he finish the wall.  You Trump supporters walk again cheer him on.  So why doesnt he just do that.  All this nonsense will be over.
no Estefania Torres Restrepo you grow up
yes 9K Likes in 15 minutes? How am I supposed to talk to this guy?
yes BUILDTHEWALL
no What??? Cmon, Ronnie, give me something better than that!
yes Sue Howie no it was about 4 foot tall and my dog gave up. Not all dogs would give up but he did and if the wall stops one criminal, one death then BUILD IT. Its not about Hate.
no Johntavious Williams well it wasn't! So why create a fake narrative! Troll!
yes Christine Huggard Roach which doctor....there were several,as anyone who has undiagnosed illness knows.By the Grace of God.........
yes If even one can be prevented. How do we not enforce the laws!!!
no How many Americans kill other American?
yes How did these immigrants get here? Probably at a port of entry. El Paso's crime level has increased since a wall was put up.
yes This is sickening, then to hear Schumer and Pelosi say the border is not a crisis for our country !!!!!!!!!!
no I sure wish trump would speak up for the families who lost loved ones to gun violence by Americans.
yes AM JUST LOOKING FOR SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP
no Thanks for walling the world's largest cartel in with us. Also for giving them a huge tax break
yes Here is a little morning history for you. Very interesting...  Thomas Jefferson His portrait is on the $2.00 Dollar Bill. This is amazing. There are two parts to this. Be sure to read the 2nd part.  Thomas Jefferson was a very remarkable man who started learning very early in life and never stopped. At 5, began studying under his cousin ' s tutor. At 9, studied Latin, Greek and French. At 14, studied classical literature and additional languages At 16, entered the College of William and Mary. Also could write in Greek with one hand, while writing the same in Latin with the other. At 19, studied Law for 5 years starting under George Wythe. At 23, started his own law practice. At 25, was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses. At 31, wrote the widely circulated "Summary View of the Rights of British America," and retired from his law practice. At 32, was a delegate to the Second Continental Congress. At 33, wrote the Declaration of Independence. At 33, took three years to revise Virginia ' s legal code and wrote a Public Education bill and a statute for Religious Freedom. At 36, was elected the second Governor of Virginia, succeeding Patrick Henry. At 40, served in Congress for two years. At 41, was the American minister to France and negotiated commercial treaties with European nations along with Ben Franklin and John Adams. At 46, served as the first Secretary of State under George Washington. At 53, served as Vice President and was elected President of the American Philosophical Society. At 55, drafted the Kentucky Resolutions and became the active head of the Republican Party. At 57, was elected the third president of the United States  At 60, obtained the Louisiana Purchase , doubling the nation ' s size. At 61, was elected to a second term as President. At 65, retired to Monticello. At 80, helped President Monroe shape the Monroe Doctrine. At 81, almost single-handedly, created the University of Virginia and served as its ' first president. At 83, died on the 50th Anniversary of the Signing of the Declaration of Independence, along with John Adams.  Thomas Jefferson knew because he himself studied, the previous failed attempts at government. He understood actual history, the nature of God, His laws and the nature of man. That happens to be way more than what most understand today.  Jefferson really knew his stuff.  A voice from the past to lead us in the future:  John F. Kennedy held a dinner in the White House for a group of the brightest minds in the nation at that time. He made this statement: "This is perhaps the assembly of the most intelligence ever to gather at one time in the White House, with the exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone."  "When we get piled upon one another in large cities, as in Europe, we shall become as corrupt as Europe ." -- Thomas Jefferson  "The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not." -- Thomas Jefferson  "It is incumbent on every generation to pay its ' own debts as it goes. A principle which if acted on, would save one-half the wars of the world." -- Thomas Jefferson  "I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people, under the pretense of taking care of them." -- Thomas Jefferson  "My reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government." -- Thomas Jefferson  "No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms." -- Thomas Jefferson  "The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government." -- Thomas Jefferson  "The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants." -- Thomas Jefferson  "To compel a man to subsidize with his taxes, the propagation of ideas which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical." -- Thomas Jefferson
yes Go tell her parents that Adrian Vargas
yes Drunk driver killed my friend...crush all vehicles except Ambulances and Fire Trucks
yes An emergency declaration ought to be reserved for legitimate emergency situations where quick, decisive action is needed to resolve a crisis.  Trump's failure to win approval for his vanity project does not constitute a national emergency.  Typically, when someone is facing a legitimate emergency, they wouldn't undermine their own argument for exercising emergency powers by admitting that the situation is such that they don't actually need to declare an emergency.  Trump is truly such a special case, that he deftly made the case for his "emergency" declaration by admitting, "I could do the wall over a longer period of time, I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster. And I don't have to do it for the election; I've already done a lot of wall for the election 2020."  Later in the same address, Trump basically admitted that his emergency declaration will not result in his Wall being built quickly.  If we are genuinely experiencing a border crisis that requires an emergency declaration from Trump, how is it that Trump was able to wait until nearly 25 months into his administration before declaring an emergency?  If the situation is so dire, and requires prompt, decisive action, exactly how will construction of a wall that would take several years to complete address the issue in time?   Sever dehydration is a medical emergency. Would you advise someone suffering from severe dehydration to begin development of a well to deal with their thirst, or would you give them a glass of water?  How do you justify building Trump's Wall to deter border crossings, when apprehensions at the southern border are near a 46 year low?  What good will Trump's Wall do to curb drug smuggling across the border, when both the DEA and the CBP admit that most of the narcotics that cross the southern border come through legal ports of entry?  How effective will Trump's Wall be at preventing undocumented immigrants from entering the country, when the Center for Migration Studies of New York found that in 2016-2017, 62% of the newly undocumented were folks who had overstayed their visas, and not crossed our southern border illegally?   How would Trump's Wall address the refugee crisis, when it won't provide any of the resources needed to process and adjudicate asylum claims, nor will it lead to a resolution of the circumstances refugees are fleeing in their homelands?  "Build the Wall!" was never a real solution. It was a slogan.  Trump'a Wall has always been a simplistic remedy offered by an ignorant sleaze in order to appeal to the simple-minded.
no Bullshit Mr President Bullshit you are.  Fuckin liar but your the best we got in office. Raise the bar. And get Barr to. Prosecute crimes of those in the public trust
no Danny Jones $157 billion a year to support illegals vs $5 billion to keep them out is ok with me
yes Im soo very sorry , my heart breaks for you and all the families that have lost a loved one .  Enough, political games , Build this wall thousands have been sacrificed because of this !!!
no He is doing the right thing!  Its long past due!  Its been talked to death  thank God Trump is a doer!  So sorry for your tragic lose
yes 1 death in my opinion is an emergency.
yes When have I not name called ? Wouldn't be me if I wasn't trying to offend you
yes Feel badly for the family but would be curious to know if they were democrats will they still vote democrat.
no Build the wall Protect our family our children
yes Worst president
no Americans with guns have killed thousands.   99.9% of deaths in America are from white Americans!
yes Yolanda Copac agreed!! Quit being a Democrat Quit being a Republican Quit bashing the current Pres and The last 44  Start being an American Live by the Constitution and Bill Of Rights  Worship a Higher Being and Remember the What America was built on  Know your enemy and who has fought for all those rights  America.. has it is now (my opinion.. not open for interpretation or discussion) is in a state of peril as well as state of emergency
yes Make no mistake, Trump couldn't care less about Americans.  You're a fool if you believe his lies.
yes You're lying stop it.
no TRAITOR
yes Danny Jones you know what else the UK can get with $5 billion? A decent dental plan for all of its citizens. Maybe you should worry about that first, and let us worry about our wall.
yes I think you'll fine Danny doesn't know what he is talking about
yes This is not ok. If President Obama has said this, it would be Ok.....but not you President Trump. Nothing is Ok if it come out of your mouth. The media and the liberal socialist in this country Ill make sure of itz
no Ok  if you say so I'll just do the usual and send my thoughts and prayers since that's what's always done in these situations
yes Yes the problem is bigger than the Illegals,  1 big bite will be a start.
no Yes we do !  percent a.s.a.p
yes If people don't like the thought of a wall then why don't we open all the prison in America they are behind a wall or barrier for some reason or let someone walk thru your front door without knocking what is wrong with you people we need to protect our country everyone one needs to come the same way as our ancestors did legally
no Craig Wahlberg
yes Jacqueline Alas doesnt count they just claim mental issues or there problemd lives. Very sad.
yes If they had barriers for 1900 plus miles of WIDE OPEN territory where illegal border jumpers can just walk in, the BP could focus more resources on those tunnels!  I have not heard of 10,000 invaders coming through a tunnel you asshat!
yes High level DEMOCRATIC,  will feel  the PAIN, only when their LOVE one are kill or rape....this is reality
yes Charlesetta Brown Illegal entry is criminal.They can go through legal channels!
no Sharon Et Trina Bratley so we should do nothing to prevent some, because we cant prevent all???????
yes thank you President Trump!
no Trump cant seem to get the funding for the wall with out....well running in to a wall. So here's an idea.  build military bases along the boarder and do training exercises. I would imagine if you fly fighter jets up and down the boarder you would be able to cover a lot of ground and radio in to boarder control locations of Invaders. And with foot troop on the ground doing exercises there would be plenty of man power to help round them up.
yes Thank you Mr President sir
yes Bullshit.
yes Absolutely.
no Kim Miller if you have to ask that question sorry to say , you are blinded by your ignorance
yes There were 323 mass killings in America in 2018.  Not a single one was committed by a person who had entered the country illegally.  You are being conned.
no Keith Webber Jr. of course since Obama never declared one to deny confess, you just proved you are a fucking idiot.    Why do you hate America?
no BULLSHIT
yes God Bless you Mr. President!!! Trump2020!!!
no Gods children
yes Frank Johnson, good luck with that, I dont waste energy on yall brainwashed Cult45 Worshippers 
yes Not to mention anyone whos done the research should know the wall is fiscally responsible
no Not new. Clinton did 17,Obama 13. Where were you
no I hope it doesnt happen to your family members:Libtards!
yes There were numerous serial killers and guess what? They r mostly white! So should they have gotten deported too?
yes Renee Korabiak Ah huh...let's not foget the multiple deliberate attempts on people Fauxtus considers enemies...ie deliberate actions taken to target and plan and physically obtain lethal items them deployed in attempts to kill them with malice aforethought, not some random guy trying to grab someone else's gun.
no Trump has never been wrong.
no I have been rear ended by an illegal immigrant twice, but fortunately my car was the only thing hurt. Of course they were not insured and I had to pay for repairs myself. Texas needs the wall and immigration enforcement.
yes Shami Khan so triggered you came to his page hahaha. How do you sleep at night being so pathetic?
yes Build The wall mr. President
yes Very well say
no Yes
no Jamie Bessette sorry for your loss tho thats intense
no Lisa P. Woodruff  Illegal aliens not immigrants
yes DID THIS ILLEGAL COME THROUGH A PORT OR THROUGH  THE DESERT? I want to know.
yes Australia loves  President Trump keep up the good work
yes Estefania Torres Restrepo not if we get enough ice agents to round them up and throw them the hell out of here
yes George Brakey They can't compete with what he's done in alittle over 2 years with jobs,Korea,taxes oil production lowest unemployment! All Dems can do is try to stop him from winning at his promise of border security  as a win for themselves!
no So sorry! Please accept my heart felt sorrow
no I'm do sorry for your loss
no Janie Rogers Doss the man was not born even present when his son was born.    Emergency
no A white American male killed 17 people at MSD last year. Guns are the real emergency
no With Trump, though, the only clear precedent being set is one of deplorable incompetence. Hes taking unpopular action that divides his party and unites the opposition, hes doing so with a combination of brazen hypocrisy and nonsense rhetoric that makes the power grab impossible to cloak, hes guaranteeing himself an extended legal battle  and he isnt even accomplishing any obvious goal (theres a reason real immigration restrictionists are against this plan) except the personal one of saving a tiny bit of face.
no Leon Rackauskas research it then
yes Dante Noel maybe you need to shut the hell up. Thanks Adam Trump 2020
yes The constant false alarm calls from all you Trumpanzees must be fucking hilarious!
yes Donna Davis No kidding!!! Gun violence in the US is the REAL emergency.
yes God Bless Our "ANGEL FAMILIES"-!!!
yes After the wall, WE START DRAINING THE SWAMP.
yes If it saves one life!
no KUS - KEEP US SAFE
no Apple Rivera people have lost loved ones from Americans also. If you wanna fix that problem you'd have to get rid of everyone, not just immigrants.
yes Bill Johnson more importantly he cares about golf!
yes Build the wall secure our borders
no https://youtu.be/ZDg7CUh53ys
no President Trump, you do what it takes to Build that Wall, You have over Billions of supporting you, and with Gods help we will get that Wall built, Trump 2020
yes I have no feelings for the deadly caravan plague
no Allyson Stuhlmiller Everyday I miss him, his face, his eyes he had the most amazing dark brown eyes. His voice telling me to calm down Dee. Only would he call.me mom when something serious happened. You are right half of me died the day he died and the other half wishes for him. He had his life planned out from the age of 6 years old.. he was like an old soul in a beautiful body. My heartbreak is sometimes too much....i miss his beautiful heart. He was very uniquely special...hes not here so every year that goes by is harder because I see his friends living out their lives and he is not here to do that. He was so full of love and life
yes You people need to believe the experts and not lying Trump.    A Border Wall isn't the answer. Most illegal immigrants overstayed their VISAS or entered through legal points of entry.
no So sad and sad for our country
yes An illegal immigrant knocked over a building and killed my brother.  Damn you Superman!!
yes Whats wrong with his head lol
no God Bless President Donald Trump. Best POTUS in 50 years. Hardest working too!
yes Meren Tinu I have worked with military from 80 different countries, there is no military on earth that does more to insure innocent people are not killed.
yes Agree  with you President Trump!!! Build that Wall!! God bless America and God bless Israel!
no It's alright when they wanted to do it an all agreed but it's just because Trump is not a life long politician they don't want him to do it an look like a hero after it stops all the drugs an massive crime from pouring into our country it's a fucking joke
yes Joseph Nowik not you again with your stupid ass s***. He didn't create this, where the hell have you been in the basement?
yes Yea well my dad was killed by one of them also. I was very young at the time.  My sisters brother and I suffered along with my poor mom. She was only 27.  Bulid that dam wall. And do something about all those kids they are having. Just to be able to stay here.  And have us support them.  While they stay home poping  kids out.
yes https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/i-didnt-need-to-do-this-donald-trump-declares-a-national-emergency
no Wendi Devalle i am sorry for your loss and i totally agree with you and don't listen to haters
yes Very sorry for your loss. Yes, building the wall will protect us all.
no Where is the blue check that this is President Trump?
no BUILD the WALL
no 100 US citizens are the victims of violent crime at the hands of illegals every day  If one of your loved ones was a victim, perhaps you would reconsider your position
no ;;
no okay and Americans kill too,  send your asses back to fucking england,  this was rightfully NATIVE AMERICANS land,  no one ever forced y'all to come here 
yes This is a tragic story but the fact remains that immigrants commit crimes at about half the rate of people born in this country. Trying to use a tragedy like this to score political points is tasteless and holding up this as a way to impugn all immigrants is disingenuous
no It's really great for you and your like-minded friends to identify yourselves as happy to see the US Constitution under attack.
yes "I didn't need to do this", is the very definition of not an emergency.
no finally! Thank you for caring!
yes God Bless you
no Ange Richmond ... No... The percentage of crime by immigrants is lower compared to percentage of Americans.
no Thank you President TRUMP!!
yes James Lewis Jackson Meanwhile as black me get gunned down by white cops.....crickets from SCROTUS!
no So now we are on to scare tactics when Americans kill each other more then we kill cows for food.
yes Ah Men     you are  Right  Mr  President
yes Chris Policronis what information specifically would you like
yes Margaret Charlton get your ignorance out of your ears. There are more factors than a simple statement to blame immigration status or lack there of. There is no actual evidence that this accident occurred because of immigration status. Peoples simple logic of well, if they where not here in the first place does not pass any body of proof tests. Theses are the facts. Someone was drinking. Someone drove a truck. Someone died. Saying this was caused from them being here illegally is not evidence. Its opinion. Saying if they where not here in the first place is conjecture. I have far beyond a GED.
yes what the Dem abortions
no I do agree with your idea though
yes If you don't like that wall just move to another country before it gets built....
no Actually, it isn't. They've repaired a little existing wall, but no new wall has been started. Do a little research. Also, spellcheck is a thing now.
no and we have laws against it and enforce them
yes Dedrick Jordan   Seek help.
no Build the wall , keep Americans safe .
yes Deanette Christopherson The Feds bring in the drugs... into the prisons.
yes Admittedly May is a nightmare but Europe is finished we are the first to leave but not the last
yes So sad.   Our President is absolutely right on this issue, as he has been on so many issues before.  Support Our President, and support our Border Wall to safeguard our Nation.
yes A walk MUST be built. Maybe some of the liberals that are against the wall should have one of their children or a family member killed/murdered by one of these illigal immigrants. Just maybe they would change their mind and be supportive in building this so needed wall.
yes Jean Kakuk ,trump wants to grab you by the pussy. Well,maybe not you
no Por pendejo tu hermano
yes To destroy USA you do not need a great military like USA. The greatest weapon to bring USA to her knees is the Democratic Party. Think about it Americans the Democratic Party are more concerned about the welfare of foreign nations & non-US citizens.
yes Just remember how el chapo manage to transport so many drugs around the world lol . He even built a tunnel . Wont stop lol not every criminal is illegal
yes Finish our Wall
yes Building the wall!
no Walls don't work. If they want to deal drugs or do harm their going to find a way to do it.  That's why their called criminals.
no Yes!!!
no Patty Bertocchini La Puma lying liar. You are 100% wrong. One officer was killed by an illegal immigrant. One. Im not defending it, but you are wrong. Fake news spreader.  https://www.google.com/amp/amp.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/dec/27/144-police-officers-died-in-line-of-duty-this-year/
yes So sorry!
yes Build the wall Mr President.  Then abolish the IRS , FBI and CIA. Next lock up all members of Congress and any other Politicians that break their constitutional oath to office . Reduce their salary to $25,000 a year , give them term limits and since they want our guns so bad , stop them from being allowed armed security . You have done a great job President Trump.  Now if we could just bring down the prices of everything in this price gouging , hyper inflated Society , so those of us that live below poverty level , could affird to live once again !!
no How many legal people kill people everyday. We have a murder problem not an immigration problem
yes Bill, Mr. trump is compromised and has proven himself to be an asset of The Russian Federation. Remember when Mr. trump advocated on behalf of Russia at The G7 in Canada? Why are we having a meeting without Russia being in the meeting? And I would recommend and its up to them, but Russia should be in the meeting and should be a part of it. former NBC celebrity game show host Mr. trump - 06/08/18 Why is this not a bigger story? That is not normal! Why not Brazil? Brazils economy is far larger than Russias. Russia is no longer a part of The G7 because it invaded its neighbor Ukraine in 2014! This is not a drill! This is serious stuff! Mr. trump is a national security risk. Im correct on this matter. 
yes Adam Corria well make the boarder control do theirs and stop bitching!!! Where is all this love for America? Their are kids getting poisoned! Lol the man keeps lying to you  dumb ass eating up
yes Paul Seldes and the Shooters was not Immigrants this was Trumpees the right Wing Idiots.
yes Yes,  President Trump, please, please build the wall. We stand with  you all the way. Also, thank you for fighting fir freedom of Christianity and what you are doing for  Israel.  I am praying for you and your family.  Keep up the  good things you are fighting for.
no Built the WALL
yes I'm british and my Visa expired. I dare someone to report me!
yes Florence Tedesco Pearl Brown Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR
no I just would like to have a hypothesis on what would happen if CNN had a bunch of illegals raped and murdered several of their reporters. Would they still be opposing President Trump and the wall? Could they even bring themselves to admit that President Trump is right?
yes Best president ever
yes Why not put the army at the bordee that money can be spend much better or wiser
yes How does  a wall  stop anyone? Reply trumpty dumpty followers ! Simple question!
no Our tax dollars are wasted anyway. Let's just take a chance and build the wall just maybe some people will use the front door and come legal or go to jail.
yes IN JESUS CHRIST NAME AMEN
yes Heartbreaking!
yes Yes build it now
yes If the wall saves one innocent life it is worth every penny
yes Very sad story. Nothing that relates specifically to immigration. Many native-born Americans drink and drive and flee accidents.
yes Walls work or else all the rich wouldnt have such high ones around their estates. Also lead works wonders too!
yes So sad this keeps happening to Angel Moms and Dads!
yes Yea but the left says the dont walk across border anymore. Apparently they take planes now.... smdh
no Unconscionable to use one person's tragedy for your own political gain. Even worse to give this man false hope. Because of Trump, this man will feel responsible for additional deaths caused by illegal aliens  when he learns more people will suffer loss like he did (when statistics demonstrate that the resources wasted on the wall could have saved countless others) if only America would have invested in alternative and far better protections than a wall. In addition, this poor Dad will be no closer to bringing his daughter back. Trump is literally compounding this man's tragedy for his political gain. GROTESQUE!
no Great leaders do not have to self-promote.  Great leaders do not have to use simple-minded propaganda spin messaging to falsely elevate themselves.  If one is a great leader, their words, actions and accomplishments speak for themselves.  Trump is one lousy, incompetent leader.
yes BUILD THAT WALL !!!
yes If the wall saves one American life Im for it. Lives Matter.
no Thank you Pres. Trump! God bless you.
yes youre an idiot
no Trump chuckled about how his "bone spurs" got him out of serving his country in Vietnam so he could play the dating game.  Macario Garcia was a boy of 3 when his parents moved their large family across the Rio Grande from Mexico to work in the fields of South Texas. Thats where the draft board found him, 19 years later, in 1942. Wounded in the Normandy invasion, Garcia recovered in time to rejoin the 22nd Infantry Regiment for its advance through the Hrtgen Forest  some of the most ferocious fighting of the war in Europe. On Nov. 27, 1944, acting squad leader Garcia led his men up a hill toward entrenched German positions. When the first machine guns opened up amid a rain of mortar fire, Garcia ignored severe wounds to his shoulder and ankle to drag himself toward the nest. When he destroyed that position, a second German gunner began firing. Once again, Garcia attacked, silencing the gun and taking four enemy prisoners. Even then, he refused to be carried from the battlefield until he knew the hill had been taken. At a White House ceremony in 1945, Staff Sgt. Garcia became the first Mexican-born soldier to receive the Medal of Honor. A month later, he was denied service at a segregated restaurant south of Houston, and when he refused to leave the premises, the owner beat him with a baseball bat. - WaPo
no Gabriel Anibal Toribio hell never learn
no Marcos Ramirez are Democrats taking money from the drug cartels politicians all see motivated by money over the best interest for Americans ,their position has no logic,with More than 70,200 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2017, including illicit drugs and prescription opioidsa 2-fold increase in a decade. ... Drug overdose deaths rose from 16,849 in 1999 to 70,237 in 2017. The bars are overlaid by lines showing the number of deaths by gender from 1999 to 2017 (Source: CDC WONDER).
no Shane Randle  so we will just ignore the fact that the immigrant is here illegally in the first place?  Build the damn wall.
yes The democrat communists lure the illegals and when they are here they find out it was all a lie,  they do what they know what to do best steal, attack , destroy and murder,  its not like they were highly educated and with endless job skills , they dont even know English
yes Ward Karsman Well, let's just do a fact check on ONE of your list...Robert Byrd was honored by the NAACP after his death, because of his tireless work for civil rights.  I understand English can be tough when its not your native language, so let me explain that NAACP is an acronym -it's made up of the first letters of the words in the title of an organization- meaning "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People".
yes So very sorry for the loss of your beautiful daughter. The blood of all these deaths is on Nancy and Ch ucks hand. Praying for your peace.
no https://www.facebook.com/100003370994761/posts/1928236563965358/
yes Its take long papa.
yes Shared
yes MAGA!
yes Eva Graham at least Pelosi has shown her Tax returns.
no Great British culture. I'm a Brit. The EU hate us. End of. So I'd rather we gave the USA 5 billion as a gift for the wall rather than give 39 billion a year to the EU ...
no When I wanted to escape prison it was a wall that stopped me
no So sorry for your loss. Let's pray that no more parents must suffer this horror.
yes https://youtu.be/YLVj1TCTQ3k
yes Im so sorry for your loss
yes Curtis Rice is the perfect example of why cousins shouldn't be allowed to breed with each other.
yes We need a Class Action Lawsuit to stop this invasion and forcing us to pay for it.
yes  I am so sorry for this man & his family! Praying for their healing  I WILL continue to pray for God to guide, direct , protect our President Mr Trump! 
yes whats a moeron?
yes Marxist Communist left sit on the left to destroy all socialist progress to overthrow capitalism. They never have a socialist agenda ever!!!! Karl Marx was Jewiish and a cousin to the Rothchilds bankers.
no Stephen Michael you make complete sense dood.
no Thank you President Trump  for doing your best to protect Americans.
yes Holy racists, batman.

no So sorry for your loss. I agree the wall must be built now
yes NO ONE but Pelosi can deny this!!!!!
no As much as I can sympathize at the loss of a daughter (mine passed away in 2013) I fail to see how one death out of over TEN THOUSAND deaths last year by drunk drivers, be they legally or illegally here is grounds to declare a national emergency, grounds to build a wall.It would be far better to declare a national emergency against all drunk driving.
no President Trump Is Building The Wall For The American Peoples Safety. Making America Great Again
no So sorry to hear of your loss it should of never happened your in my prayers may those so opposed to the wall open their eyes to what is really happening as a result of. Open wide borders our President is trying to protect us from things like this happening God bless you and your Family
yes Meanwhile: https://www-nytimes-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/us/ethan-couch-affluenza-jail.amp.html?amp_js_v=a2&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQCCAE%3D#referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2018%2F04%2F02%2Fus%2Fethan-couch-affluenza-jail.html
no If Anyone monitors this feed ....we have a family in LaGrange, GA that started an orphanage in Haiti...they are stuck there because they cannot get a Visa for the baby they adopted. The American Embassy is shut down. They are desperate! Does anyone have any connections to help bring them home?? I dont know how to share their story/post outside of my page...
no Keep the wall building
no Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin fake crisis is your opinion you got from media opinion. Truth is the voters, the president & Federal border agents disagree. What one would you choose, media bias or the source of people who are on the boarder, the president who has access to info no one else does, the voters who put someone in office to do a job that has gone unchecked for years?
no That I can agree on. I guess I misinterpreted your first post and I apologize for the misunderstanding.   Though we might not agree on everything, I respect your views and knowing you're a future politician, I'll give you this advice to help you on your path.  The ironic tone of your comment made it sound like you were making a statement on the president's priorities instead of him pushing propaganda. Some might have understood your position, but I think your comment is open to a lot of misinterpretations.  Nothing's wrong with irony or humor of course, though clearly stating your position is a must in this day and age (especially considering everyone takes everything as an attack nowadays). Hope this can be of some help for your future career. :3
yes I am not American but I had always been your fan for the fine person you are. I think people must trust in your decisions. The government has to protect its people and the president must do whatever is in his reach to help with that. I would be proud to have you as my president. God bless you and your people.
no Ron O'Hearn we enforce immigration laws every day too so what's your point?
yes Border emergency what a hoax
no Build the Wall
yes Americans kill Americans all the time. Hell I bet the damn police kill more innocent people than any so called undocumented immigrants
yes I like that
yes Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin opinion vs fact..2.) Jobs  ~ 4 million new jobs have been created since the election, and more than 3.5 million since Trump took office.  ~More Americans are employed now than ever before in our history. Jobless claims at lowest level in nearly five decades.  ~The economy has achieved the longest positive job-growth streak on record. Job openings are at an all-time high and outnumber job seekers for the first time on record.  ~Unemployment claims at 50 year low African-American, Hispanic, and Asian-American unemployment rates have all recently reached record lows.  ~African-American unemployment hit a record low of 5.9 percent in May 2018.

Nearly two-thirds of Americans rate now as a good time to find a quality job. Optimism about the availability of good jobs has grown by 25 percent.  ~Added more than 400,000 manufacturing jobs since the election.  ~Manufacturing employment is growing at its fastest pace in more than two decades. 100,000 new jobs supporting the production & transport of oil & natural gas.
no I am so sorry for your loss. I stand with our president. Love and Prayers
no El Chapo's people dig underneath walls
yes No, Don. They will not keep us safe, but they will contribute to our safety.
no Make this go viral: https://www.facebook.com/dave.reiser.9/videos/10213329614251019/?t=19
yes Diane Smith DONT COUNT ON IT!
no Emily Neal I'm so sick of liberal stupidity.  Crime is a state issue.  This is a federal issue since it has to do with illegal immigration.   Stop voting Democrat, and your state will fair better.  Also, go back to school and educate yourself on state and federal issues.  You must have skipped government classes.
no If it can save even one life we should build the wall, right libs?
no Do best for  every one, people country & world, once we to gether we do every thing for safe life. safety is must in our  life than money. Wall we build later , but criminal mafia is inside the countryu between people.  capture them first , take technology from them because thy use every technology in my home ,in our body. Thy r behind my family ,  want divide, divorce, ruin , I never seen them I don't want to see them, they ruin any life when they want, either president ,  Pm , businessman, or any people, They R mouth speaker , Capture any camera delete image , Disappear criminal mafia, Hack track & push mind for any one ,  They have no right to look any one's personal life, , Be strong sir , God Bless you & nyour Family.
yes need a wall.
no Certain people do not believe that a southern border wall will make any difference but just wait until it hits home and someone they love lose their life because of lack of that border wall you better believe it
no There's a serious problem at our Southern borders.
yes Charles Michael Spooner II Yes! And they will.
no Build the WALL. BUILD the WALL.  Keep us and the country safe please. God's your guie and protector.
yes We can t blame the vulgar or bad feelings of the most people for our deceptions.....they are what they can .....but we must live and fight for God Amrica and all people deserves to live with moral respeat and true love in GOD for Amrica!!!!!!
yes Dianna Adams Ewen - If you are referring to the "new trade agreement with Mexico" that has never been ratified by Congress and therefore has never taken effect, no it does not make any provision for Mexico funding any phony walls, directly or indirectly.  And no I never thought Mexico was going to write a check.  I am not as stupid as your "president"  who said precisely that, or his voters who were stupid enough to believe him when he said it and believe him again when he claimed he never said it.
yes Danny Hernandez
yes This man took an oath too protect us Americans and hes trying too do this.Its not his job to fix all of the  Americans problems of health and finances,take responsibility people we are not entitled.
no Stops the dividing of families. They can not throw their children over the fence and say America separated them
yes Sorry for all your losses and yes 100 % with the idea of the wall !!!! R.I.P to all who were killed by evil
yes God Bless America and our President.
yes So should we just build a wall around the whole country so no one can get in or out? The south border is not the only border. Also, how many criminals from America have traveled across the southern border to live there illegally? It goes both ways. 911 happened because of a man across seas, complete opposite direction. Should I also mention that this land was taken from Indians, not given to our ancestors? There is so much to this that no one is considering because Trump's phony speeches and false promises are trapping you guys into this crap. Our country has been built on white, biblical, supremecy, and anyone who doesn't go by the book or anyone who belongs to a culture they don't like, they are trying to keep them out.
yes Dan Griffin   Neither do I!!!  It's facts versus feelings!!!!
no i feel bad for you...no one should ever be treated that way.
yes Alberto Weisz Im no fool. I know a door gates and fences do nothing to keep anyone out of my house.
yes Dave Heffner its already illegal to cross the border
yes fake news better than no news
no How come you dont advocate for victims of mass shootings using the same rationale?
no #AGREE!   Walls work, so complete the wall!  God bless!
yes Hal Eric Mitlitsky  hes been trying to get out of this job since he was elected.
no Sharon Et Trina Bratley at least they problem had a license and insurance also wont be driving
yes Nancy and Chuckie are you two listening?
yes Build the wall and drain the social democratic swamp. President Trump send those liberal NWO GLOBALIST communist traitors to Siberia WHERE THEY BELONG.
yes Thank you Sir
no Trump is trying his bestv
no Ralph Alvord Hey
yes Ughhhhhhh
yes You gave up too much in this deal! Immigration will be increased and we will suffer the consequences more!
no Michael Thompson https://www.facebook.com/roguepressbriefs/photos/a.219075375254770/550355752126729/?type=3&theater
no Also, left coast, land of fruits and nuts
no help, Make our world a better place.  please, Mr President
no 772019702
no Hal Eric Mitlitsky every single president has declared a national emergency, usually to protect foreign countries, time to protect ours.
yes Dylan Clymore yes! 4 walls to be exact, but one wall might be made with vertical steel bars.
no we will to, ,
yes You  can  blame  governor  Newsome  and  polos  of it
no Gus Keller You should move California or better yet to San Francisco with the other snowflakes like yourself .
yes Will the wall keep everyone save from the Americans that are killing people an robbing houses an drugs I dont see how the Mexicans get the blame for everything Americans do wrong
no I thought for sure this story would be about those big ass fore-heads. Lol
no My president
yes Another mass shooting and not even a word from the "Mar a Lago" national emergency crisis con.
yes James Campbell how many die because of a car ?why arent you screaming about banning cars .more gun laws isnt going to stop it .
yes 2020 Trump & BEYOND. Enough with all the illegal invaders build the wall and send all them back......
yes John N Karen Morris it's hard to be funny with ignorant bigots like you
no You want to blame immigrants   Rally me this  what if trumps grandfather  were the immigrant who killed his daughter   Is that the solution for an unnecessary wall  We have more shootings of backyard corn bread  Americans killing more than any other race in the United States    The statistics are proof  You cant blame one immigrant When last year alone you have 50-1  50-Americans  1- immigrant  Responsible for the murders of innocent people   We have a Gun problem  Not an immigrant issue
yes Hey pussy-grab, remember that time you told us Mexico was going to pay for the wall?  Was that "fake news"?
no Ok . ask pelosi and the lottery man what they think coz they dont care! They care more about looking after the illegals
no Jim Acosta and Nancy Pelosi try to ignore this. The American people hear it loud and clear.
no Alberto Weisz so why are there still doors at your place then? You still carry a set a keys to get in too???
no Channel 3 here in Phoenix interviewed a Dad who lost his son to a multiple DUI offender, illegal alien. His son was hit and run, after initially hitting him the man in fleeing ran over him, killing him, he supports the wall 100%
yes Theyll tunnel under it mate. Waste of time.
yes President Trump, respectfully I implore you to quit taking all this gruff from the democrats and their far left wing. Please release the documents that you promised to unseal. You need to expose the lawless left and if so those on the right! If you actually see these messages help America help you make it great again, expose Washington for who they are!
no Not likely soon
no Sorry for your loss Sir, such a waste of life, that would never have happened if not for the laws or lack of enforcement, and the so called leaders from the lowest city mayors, to the gov"s, congressmen, and senators lack of caring, or maybe they getting kickbacks of one sort of another from making sure the flow of people, drugs, and sickness never stop !!!!
yes We must build the wall not only for todays citizens but for future generations..Thank you President Trump for striving to get the USA back to a nation of integrity...Thank you and God bless
no omg thats so funny it just cracks me up; haven't laughed this hard since i watched the fake pres make a fool of himself in front of the WH yesterday.
no I'd call millions of illegals here over the years a fucking crisis.wouldnt you.
yes Keith Webber Jr. You get Lego Stones Troll. Than you can bulit when you finished with work  Wall , das and Night  Low Minded naive Brain Limited Trumpee
no In fairness to all the Angel moms & dads whose children were killed by illegals who came into the country illegally, we the citizens demand that the wall must be finish.
yes How many sons and daughters has trump killed
yes Marcos Ramirez I guess his accomplishments mean nothing, its cool just wake up with hate in your heart and MSN in your ears
no Albert Lucas sorry I meant billion it auto corrected.
yes Ive been following the whole Build the Wall debate the best I can & I would like to voice my opinion. Why on earth would American citizens NOT want to protect their country?? I cant figure that out. People need to set aside their feelings about President Trump & Congress & strip the debate down to what the issue is. This is keeping America safe, plain & simple. I really dont care if its a wall, border agents, cameras, whatever.  Put the bickering aside & just DO SOMETHING! We protect our homes, our possessions; why not our country? This is where we LIVE people! Such stupidity all this whining & name-calling. What good does that do? Put that energy towards something positive.
no I want the wall built but i do not want my president to look stupid . He is after all the PRESIDENT OF the UNITED STATES OF America
yes Our president would be impeached if he didnt something wrong. You people need to just go with the flow until hes impeached or done
yes How many more must die til we get a wall??
yes Stupid
no Tim Koepp , nothing will change until it happens to a politicians family.
no Very sorry for your daughter being a victim, sir, this is beyond serious, Kate Steinle should have been enough for Naughty Nancy to flip and convince Chuckie we need border wall, and over-all extensive immigration reform!
yes This guys opinion doesnt matter , the only opinion that matters the the radical liberal politicians who want open borders and anchor babys to boost their voter rolls
no Time to create a Border Chief Engineer.  Where are the Engineers in politics???? Be the first President to embrace engineers.  Engineers create our economy, but are consistently ignored as the experts they are.    Time to appoint a Chief, let him answer the Wall updates.   Time for the President to move onto the next project.  If you need anyone to argue the reason to build it, just make a Wall website, with a politician section with all the Democrats saying a Wall is necessary.    In 2020 we don't want to argue the Wall like an Abortion arguement of past elections, we the voters want to say, "The Wall was built, crime, drugs, have gone down in the past year".  We cannot say that if the Wall is not built.
no This is sad but shouldn't be America's main focus there was ANOTHER mass shooting yesterday done by an American! Many people killed many hurt!
no Trump is a liar because he says the the Mexicans are going too pay for the border wall but he is coming too the democrats for he is a liar impeach him send him back too his reality tv show called apprentice
no So South Asia has also to right to build the wall to stop your government way towards more warfare.
yes Danny Jones I'll happily second that!!!!
no Yvail Fox that would be
yes https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.elpasotimes.com/amp/2117269002
no So sorry
yes Danny Jones, I am sorry that the European Union is taking 39 billion dollars a year from your nation every year. Completely unsustainable.   Praying that Brexit is finalized this year.
yes Lisa Mannim retired from the Michigan department of corrections,  if done right ,the wall /fences ,would stop about 99% .I was in Israel before the wall was built, they had weekly bus bombings, after wall built bus bombings stopped,  then they built a wall ,along Egyptian border, where thousands were entering illegally, know there was only 16 people get across, wall work if built right, and manned right. Thank you.
yes Thank you Mr President
no Go Trump you The Man!!
no How many people have been murdered by Illegal immigrants VERSUS How many people have been murdered by white Americans lets say in the last 10 years?
yes Danny Jones what culture is that then ?
no bs...do you even know what the term means...3-4 victims ...thats  what...take a look at percentages...there are 14 times  the amount of citizens to latinos....350 million to 20 million.....math alone tels you theres going to be more citizens killing ...gangs kill that many on any given weekend.....mass shootings lol...get educated
no We are meeting some real resistance from local,state and national elected officials that are obviously on the game from cartels! It seems draining the swamp has gotten more complicated! No wonder Trump made the comment that he hoped it wasn't too late to save America!
no That is a big problem in San Diego
no There are many better ideas. A wall won't stop the tunnels nor will it stop the fentanyl thats flying in fromChina.
yes So sorry for your loss there is no excuse for not stopping these horrible acts.
yes That's is truly terrible what happened to you, both. But I would argue a wall doesn't fix these things as accidents happen from more than just illegal immigrants. Universal healthcare would certainly have helped with those medical bills though.  Apple - if CHP knew he came through Texas, then he couldn't have crossed illegally. If it was an illegal crossing then they couldn't know that, think about it. That really does suck, what happened to you, but clearly a wall wouldn't have prevented this from happening to you.
no I think we are very naive if we  think this wall will stopp immigrants ! Use this money instead to help people in US that need help !
no Here in Germany we can only dream of closed boarders - keep on realizing your plans
no Build the wall President Donald J. Trump. The polls AREN'T correct!! You have a LOT MORE support than they say...they just don't poll everyone!! WE WANT THE WALL!! WE NEED THE WALL!! WE DESERVE THE WALL!!
no it happen everywhere in the world.
yes Just build the wall !!!
no Mr. President, please stop using people like this as pawns in your ill-fated game of chess. Her suffering is unconscionable and the culprit should be held to account, but it doesnt justify your actions. The research shows this just isnt where the focus should be right now. An unjustified executive power grab like you took this week, which you denounced under Obama, only steepens the fact that this scare mongering is atrocious, unethical, and dangerous.
no I agree
yes Trump made some very specific promises during his campaign and I voted for him because of those promises. I want three things before I vote for Trump in 2020. 1). I want Hillary/The Clinton Foundation prosecuted. 2). I want progress on the Wall. Funding and the wall being started. 3). I want Obama Care repealed. No, I didn't say fixed or a work around or even kind of repealed. I want it Repealed. And NO(!) repealing the "mandate" is NOT the same thing as a repeal. And no, he didn't promise to FIX Obamacare. Donald Trump was clear, he promised to repeal the most oppressive legislation ever imposed on the American people. These points are nonnegotiable; period.
no I support America also like trump does, trump 2020
yes Repost Nancy's number 202-225-4965 build the wall. Here's Chuck's 202-224-6542. Be professional but demand the wall funds.  Repost numbers. Let's do this
no Please stop using these people.
yes Sorry for your loss.
no Never heard or read story about that... most of it is the illegals
no Donald J. Trump, put the border wall to a national vote. Let the people decide. I believe we need it, and I am with you. Lets see if the people of America do as well.
yes That's What sanctuary cities are all about
no Yes we need a wall erected as soon as possible !!
no Build the wall dont let the lefties win. Ignore the protest majority wants the wall. You made that a campaign promise and you always keep your campaign promises. You are tough and cant be bullied . Build that wall president Trump!
no Democrat socialists call the invasion of criminals " manufactured". Pelosi said Trump is delusional,there's no crisis. When they're,along with Soros & his buddy are org & paying these caravans of enemies? They are committing treason against Americans while trying to disarm citizens, not criminals. Hitlers.
yes Drugs are a choice that unfortunately many teens make...Innocent teens getting shot and killed in school is not a choice......Where is the national emergency?
no Im so sorry to hear that. I do believe in our President Trump
yes You know if walls are important to you, you should have gotten one when the Republicans had Congress.
yes Completely agree, Charlesetta.
yes There is no difference between an illegal alien & a Democrat.  Their "kill record" is sickening!
no Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall!!
no Yves Graux
yes Danny Jones what is your culture not trying to be rude
yes John N Karen Morris yes that is something a fascist cunt would do.  We know how to deal with fascism here.    To report a president that is a Russian asset, support Mueller.
yes Outstanding leadership President Trump!
no RIGHT MR PRESIDENT
no Bill Johnson are you serious
yes Real talk
yes Tim Somolitis, the Republicans are divided about the need but either way, a person who listens to a proven compulsive liar who can neither negotiate or make a deal and wasted 6 billion dollars of taxpayer money shutting the Gov down over money for a Wall that he said Mexico said they would pay for, is in no position to suggest who others should  listen to   Bottomline, it's clear that the politicians will deal with this in court.  The first of many lawsuits have already been filed about what they call a " Manufactured Crisis" in order to bypass Congress
yes https://www.statista.com/statistics/476456/mass-shootings-in-the-us-by-shooter-s-race/        Overwhelmingly, the mass shooters in our country are white. But the narrative out of the Oval is not that. Wonder why.
yes Remove democrats for obstructing
yes I am sad that innocent people have lost there lives, and a group of people, Liberal Democrats, who have supported the wall before, refuse to do the right thing just to Hurt Trump.  Well guess what Americans are being robbed (ME), murdered, drugs crossing borders,  trafficking of women and children.  DemocRATS your not hurting Trump your Hurting US citizens. GET A CLUE!
no https://www.facebook.com/450243058344758/posts/2140768489292198/
yes Dan Burnzinsky Thought them over it! Mind bullets!
yes Foreheads.
no John Zappini, your argument is complete BS. A border wall will not stop the flow of drugs into the US.
no I would become Pelosi's nightmare for the rest of her life if that was my daughter ......
no Angela K Christensen I cannot claim to have lost a loved one due to an illegal immigrant. However, I pay my fair share of taxes, they dont. I pay for my medical usage, they dont.  I pay for a lot of the things given to them freely. Im not against people coming to the USA. Im all for them coming to our wonderful country. However, I want them to do so legally and become citizens. Thats all.
yes Steven Keslar just like we sued obummer? Not going to work
no 5 people were killed the other by a gunman. The Las Vegas massacre was a national emergency. 100s of people were killed. When is the real emergency going to be addressed ?
yes Danny Jones Thank you for caring.  God bless.
yes Amen to you and your family we send our prayers
no BUILD THE WALL AN SIR please stop telling the left what the right is up too gives them to much ammunition or prep time to make your life an ours miserable.... I SUPPORT YOU AN THE WALL... AS DO VERY MANY AMERICANS... WE STAND BEHIND OUR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP....have a wonderful Presidents day tomorrow.... an HOW DARE CNN AN OTHER NEWSPAPER PEOPLE TRY TO MCOK OUR PRESIDENT.....clinton obama supporters...when obama had a 12 different times emergencies for stupid things he just did it an no one even knew.... YOU SIR ARE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BUILD THE WALL....an you sir are our president for the next 6 years...
no Krista Meyer they do put out warnings, at least in Ohio.  I post many of them in my crime group.
yes Gun reform https://www.vox.com/2019/2/16/18227655/aurora-shooter-gun-domestic-violence
yes Preach All You Want Buddie , Becaus The Democrat Politicians Dont Care One  Bit, There To Worried About Destroying America.
yes The CR bill you signed that was full of pork, amnesty, and restrictions on ICE will do the opposite of help Americans. #offthetrain
yes on behalf of idiots everywhere, let me say how insulting!
yes Should have never happened  opposers can say what they want ...but the facts remain- if this illegal wasnt here she would still be alive! How we spend billions on taxpayer funded abortions but cant find 5 to build a wall infuriates me!
yes What a shame to lose a beautiful daughter
yes Yes, please don't let us ever forget those who have suffered because of our open borders. It is time to get our borders closed so we can be safe and check everyone coming into our homeland.
no Crime rates are higher for Americans than for immigrants. Fix gun control.
no Gabriel Anibal Toribio another one, heres to the 1% Kerlyn Marcelino....
yes Another sad example of why our country needs secure borders.
no What about all the whites killing Americans here, every mass shouting theres has been has been by an America. White Donald
yes I propose building a wall in memory of those lost over the past 3 decades due to lack of and ineffective border security. Think of all those lost since 1990 due to terrorist attacks along with all of those killed by illegal criminal aliens. The wall could be similar to that of the Vietnam Veterans Wall and it could travel throughout all 50 states making people aware of the lives lost giving us the opportunity to pay homage to them. Thank you for all you do Mr. President. We are praying for you in all your decisions and endeavors.
yes Nothing more American than mass shootings!
yes Joseph Nowik all presidents have called national emergencies.  I cant wait until people know what they are talking about before spouting off.
yes Mike Mandel well guess what. That is exactly what is proposed.
no Gabriel Bergeron, compare a job in a steel factory with a job? Are you on drugs?   https://www.facebook.com/TheOther98/photos/a.115969958413991/2503185179692445/?type=3&theater
no What about them? It has nothing to do with the fact that we can act in a responsible way, and slow down the illegals. No one ever said this would stop homegrown evil. The point is to stop or reduce  what we can control.
yes Bryan Hurlburt Himself, himself and himself.
yes Totally empty words
yes Illegal immigrants killed millions of Native Americans.
yes What happened to E-verify? That is the one issue that would fix most of the problems.  I want a wall, just wondering about why E-verify isn't made mandatory for employers....
yes A legal citizen killed my nephew with a gun. We must get rid of all guns! Right?
no COLLUSION!  - Trump Advisor, Stone Communicated w/ Russian GRU Hackers & Wikileaks about release of DNC emails  - Trump Campaign Manager, provided polling data to Russian Agent  - Don Jr./Kushner/Manafort met Russian Agent to get Hillary Dirt  - Russia promised Trump Tower Moscow
yes Thank you Mr President Donald Trump for working so hard for America and giving us the best,  you only want whats good for us , because these is your country even doe you could live anywhere in the world you choose America,  because you are a greatful son , unlike the democrat communists that want to destroy America to make themselves rich
no By the way, Presidents Day, Monday Feb.18th, is canceled until we get one.
no People who don't want the wall are for criminals -aka. Democrats. We elected President Trump to fight criminals and we want him to . #BUILDTHEWALL
yes Austin Reis Green Did you read some of these comments? Horrible how some have suffered because of this insanity.
yes Fox news  Fake news
yes Why don't we hear about these on news  They're to busy Harrasing our President
yes I'm shocked USA today wrote this. In the era where media is ignoring and dismissing angel families this is a shocker
no That is so very sad also.  But that isn't what this message stream is about.  You should start a new post on that one.    Surely you would get support for it.
yes Thank you for declaring an emergency.
no Jackie Lee Collins American prisons are filled with Americans.  And?  You think because we have criminals here we should invite more criminals to come here?     Were you born this stupid or did you have to work at it?
yes So sorry for your loss. Praying.
yes Simone Piloni
no Linda Durbin How many people have been murdered by Illegal immigrants VERSUS How many people have been murdered by white Americans lets say in the last 10 years?
yes Not a bad thought.  It should be part of a discussion of best ways to address any problem.
no Yes sir thank you President Trump!
yes Eva Graham , after we impeach Drumpf for treason!
yes Tyler Loving that is BS propaganda you are trying to spread
no All for the National Emergency but the National Security bill needs VETOd if it makes it that far. Dont give in. It sucks!
yes My question is, What real harm will a wall or fence do?
no Lynn Limauro Floyd   Your son was a moron
yes Kris Landers sorry the wall will prevent further loss of funds why do they want to come here Free healthcare , jobs schools oh and dont forget birth right citizenship are all opportunity that should be for green card holders and sponsored workers etc .
yes Build  the  wall .
yes The name Donald Pinocchio is very beautiful. Your priority is Israel's security !! Do not lie to the American people.
no Stop
yes Guns kills more people than illegals.  Doi.
yes Danny Jones you need to go educate yourself, and have all the facts checked! Please!
yes Barbara Samuel well I just sent you the pictures you say Im lying about. Ive no reason to lie about an accident, only to bring awareness. In case youd like to put your foot in your mouth, I can send you my hospital bills, and the CHP report.
yes This is a very sad story.  Too bad it has nothing to do with a stupid wall.
yes Thank you Mr President You truly are a Godsend to America and the free world! God bless you
no DUMOCRATS KNOW WALLS MAKE US SAFE SO THEY DON'T WANT THEM  BUT THEY HAVE THEM AROUND THEIR HOUSE  RIGHT PELOSI
yes the democrats are against him , the republicans are weak, we the people put him there and its up to us to keep him there keep up the good work mr  President
no Albert J Destefanis it's to bad people can't see trump for what he is, a lying egomaniacal psychopath!!
yes Benedict Bchele we live in a free country, people can say what they want.
yes Guess he learned from the Democrats on how to exploit situations.   Democrats are professional victims !
no Kris Landers How hard for you is this to understand ??? If the person was never in the country, he wouldn't have been here to cause the accident. -- Get that GED, you need it .
yes I wish NANCY & CHUCK WOULD LISTEN TO THIS TRAGIC NEWS AND BUILD THE WALL!!
no Bullshit! If protection for American families was Dumpster's highest priority he'd be having high level meetings to look for solutions to our national gun fatalities emergency.
no The left relates to a wall like a marriage therapist talks about a psychological defense mechanism a wall is an inanimate object design to protect life and property! What the heck is wrong with the left they do not know the difference between legal and illegal and now they're talking about a physical wall like an emotional problem God help us.
no We need a good purge.
yes And a few trump supporters killed kids in mass shootings. Right wing extremists groups are our number one threat right now. Stop the dog whistles and get your people in line. Day after day we keep hearing about your people harassing, hurting and killing people. DO SOMETHING
yes So if a legal citizen kills a person, it's okay, right?
no Sad that so many have lost their lives. I pray that all illegals are removed before any more of our children are murdered & addicts get help before they are killed by these drugs flowing into our country. God Bless President Trump for taking the necessary steps when our traitor congress would not.
no Last year there were 40,000 firearm related deaths on the US. Last year the Trump administration overturned environmental protection statutes and workplace safety regulations. Meanwhile, people without legal resident status actually have one of the lowest crime rates in the country- precisely because they dont want to risk being deported. If Trump truly wanted to make American families safe he would implement stricter gun laws, reinstate laws that ensure clean water and safe food, and protect workers from dangerous working conditions. But we all know he couldnt care less about actually making American families safe. #AmericaDeservesBetter

no So sorry that happened!  Prayers for you and your family, yes President Trump built the wall!
yes Lets start taking names of RINOs and get rid of them
no We are. Let them try and sue him. Eyes dont lie.  Honestly, he should have just called for a national emergency from the get go, but I understand him wanting to try going through congress first. This country is not holding thousands of illegal kids because we dont have a border crisis. Think about that. Why do we have so many illegal children in custody? We have a problem people. It's not that hard to see.
yes So sorry for the loss of  your precious child.
yes What about melina trump she is also immigrant
yes Who are the 116 sick F***CS  that thinks this is funny?

yes Debbie Valdovinos you are ignorant or a liar, which?
no Is it possible dems are getting kickbacks from drug cartels?
no No life is worth 5 billion dollars says every Democrat everywhere
yes Just do it do it do it.... Nobody loves crimes and criminals
no Bull O'Neill You obviously are repeating crap that you have heard and I gather do not spend much time reading and learning about the rescession..Maybe this will help you a bit .you will be hoping for another President like Obama by the time Trump is out of office because his spending is on steroids.....I am sure you won't believe me  but easily researched.....but you won't like the facts you will find out. He has never been fiscally good with his own companies that is why he has filed bankruptcy so often.     https://www.therichest.com/rich-list/the-biggest/the-top-10-biggest-spending-presidents/      https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/07/trump-budget-deficits-growing-big-spending-fiscal-irresponsibility/           and he isn't doing well in the way of trade deficits either despite his bragging...     https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/08/03/trump-hates-trade-deficit-its-track-be-biggest-decade/?utm_term=.7f7f6ef1fee9\
yes I'm sure when wealthy Americans built barriers around their homes, they weren't directing thoughts of illegal immigrants or cartels breaking in there homes.  I'm pretty sure they were thinking bout Americans meth heads instead
yes Sir Donald Trump is God sent. Americans don't value what they have, unlike us in Nigeria who don't have any president.
yes MAY GOD COMFORT HIS FAMILY.
no #BUILDTHEWALL.
no Yes, ASAP
no The world has 0 respects for the people of the USA,  our government likes to play the good guy, so keep working. Your money is working.
yes Would LOVE to see the statistics of how many people died from mass shootings versus being murdered by illegal immigrants.
no Noble Loria so according to your logic, the live Facebook streams of the past week or so, at the border where the area is going from wide open area to an area that has a wall is fake?  Ohhhhhhkay.
no Do you mean walls like most of the ones that are against it has around their homes?  Umm makes since to me !
yes Michelle Ann Deshaw Pearl Brown Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR
yes We stand with our President!
no This type of divisive claptrap is exactly what the Australian government has been feeding us for the past 10+years and we are finally waking up to it. Keep the public ignorant and xenophobic because that makes us easier to control. Just do a little bit of research and, like Australia, you will find that most undocumented immigrants arrive legally on tourist visas and simply don't go home. No border wall is gonna stop that.
yes Jamie Bennett I agree! What does he care about?
no Good morning sir
no David Simmons
no https://youtu.be/W1XDwADwfBw
yes Ok fucktard because ONLY illegal immigrants kill?!? What about all these Americans Killing Babies!!!
yes I am so sorry that Pelosi , Shumer and their Congress hate you so much and do not care, they hate me too and my family nearly died from drunk driving illegals a few years ago, I cannot believe how our country had turned its back on us . Thank God for Trump!! I thank God everyday for Trump, he loves his country and the people.
no #BUILDTHEWALLNOW
no July 16, 2018: I was rear ended by an illegal, Daniel Zuniga who was driving an Enterprise moving truck, injured my back, neck, and shoulder. Enterprise didnt take responsibility because they said they didnt contract with him. Daniel Zuniga is no longer able to be found. Find all underground tunnels coming into the US.  #BUILDtheWALL President Trump 
no Danny Jones thank you but since you can give us your Prayers!!  They are better than money!
yes Thank you Mr Trump...Illegal Immigration costs us way more each year than building the wall.  Prior presidents have wanted to do this but never got it done.  Well sorry people, like him or not President Trump has been working for me, and you, and finally putting America first since he took office.  The economy is good, unemployed the lowest its even been, the military is getting stronger, and Trump is working to get all of the unfair deals and so on that the US has been getting screwed over on.  Yes there is alot of other things that need attention..prescription prices...veterans..elderly...homeless people, revamping the welfare system...but I think Trump has done a good job so far and glad he doesn't mind ruffling some feathers doing what he has to do to get things done..
no MAGA, Built the wall,  dont let these crazy Democrat politician stop u. God bless you, you have turn around lots of Democrats to support you and I'm one of them, just keep doing what u are doing
no Wow tump you use other peoples sorrows to advance the far rights agenda that you have no clue about . What about when my uncle worked on your casino and you flied for bankruptcy just so you did not have to pay him , poor guy also went bankrupt when he was left with a $750,000 debt
yes Illegals don't belong here! We welcome immigrants coming legally! If they are coming illegally, they must be hiding something! BUILD THE WALL!
yes Build the wall and in same time sand all illegal immigrants back where they come from. You will see difference in over economy. Unemployment O, school classrooms half full, jails half empty, court rooms need to be open two days a week. Waiting to go see Dr half as long. Over economy booming because government and States have surplus money. Crime cut 90% this is just small picture what is illegals immigrants doing to America and American Citizens.
no Jennifer Yvonne Croff you are right, but i could also blame alcohol: if there wouldnt be alcohol she would be alive. Should alcohol be banned?
no Me too, loss my son almost 8 years ago.....
yes We must have the wall!!!

no Tear down the doors of any politicuan who is against the wall, year down THEIIR fences, throw away THEIRr keys to their cars, pitch tents in THEIR backyards and invite any illegal to squat there and see how THAT suits them...and by the way, take THEIR guns and tie the hands of the police that  protect them, then see what kind of tune THEY sing then!

yes Yes build the wall,

yes https://www.facebook.com/NowThisPolitics/videos/346213832769560/
yes Laurel Balinski, there is nothing   illegal about them  if they haven't entered the United States!  Can't refer to them as illegal immigrants.   It's your comment that's wrong!  Why is YOUR FB PAGE FAKE?
no Ask Putin he knows about walls
yes PRESIDENT TRUMP 2020
no Thank you Mr. President for not giving up. God bless you.
no Lynn Limauro Floyd How many people have been murdered by Illegal immigrants VERSUS How many people have been murdered by white Americans lets say in the last 10 years?
yes the morons dont understand how tariffs work and the " new " NAFTA has not even been signed
yes Ride Mr President. You have true love for America. God bless President D. Trump.
yes I trust you read my comments on how to end this thing.
yes Yes the sooner the better.
no You are disgusting because her life means nothing to you. She and all the others who will be killed by someone who has NO right to be here are the reason we need a wall!! You actually have a higher chance of being affected by an illegal as you are part of the Latino community.
no Keith Webber Jr. not too bright are you???.....sad
yes And yet, he hasnt done anything for the Americans who continue to be shot and killed by other Americans at an alarming rate. What a joke. This crime is not indicative of immigrants.
yes President Trump,  Please enforce border walls and security to enforce our southern border NOW!
no BUILD THE WALL!!!!
yes Emil Drr
yes Marybeth Paredes so dont fix one because there are multiple?
yes We need the wall but we need to staff our wall with our military men and woman. If they attempt to cross our boarder we have every right to eliminate that illegal immigrant to extent of power we need to use up to and including death
no Mass shootings kill hundreds in America, when do we institute meaningful gun reform.
no WE LOVE YOU POTUS  !!!!! MAGA !!!!!!!!!!
yes An illegal immigrant killed my Uncle. Had been deported twice.
no Jo Sechi We must have a Wall  and we Must Stop illegal immigrants from killing    Us ..
yes We need to stop talking about being safe from other humans and bring attention to be safe from the New World Order....There is an peace deal on the table that if America and Israel sign..it will start the Tribulation...Our only real enemy is Satan...
no Trump 2020
yes It's not about a wall! It's all about the voting booth! We have a RIGHT to have voter I'D!  Now let's talk collusion & meddling in an election!  TRUMP MAGA 2020++++++++
yes Bill Johnson yeap very safe , shootings eveywhere theaters, schools, churches, daycares etc., etc., etc.,etc.,etc.,
yes WHEN IS EVERYONE GONNA GET IT???    THE ONLY REASON MUELLER DID THE INVESTIGATION WAS TO KEEP THE HEAT OFF HIMSELF, HILLARY AND OBAMA FOR THE CLINTON EMAIL SCANDEL.  TIME TO GET THE CROOKS IN PRISON.
yes So go over there and do what you say you want to do. Nobody's stopping you
yes Rochelle Askinazi I dont know, but I know who killed our mom!
yes Regarding immigration, read your Bible, Leviticus 19:34
yes Joseph Roy lets see the parents befriended some. They are actually to blame. Hard to swallow yet logically if they had not, the child would never had been raped.
no Beverly Harris so let in other countries problems instead of trying to fix the ones here already?
yes Let us compare.  I live in Indiana with lifetime gun permits and we have one bad county in the state Lake County.  Tons of bad people live in Lake county rest of state is fine.  Illinois has strict gun laws and is a shithole full of shootings.  It is definately the people not the guns killing people.   If not guns they would stab each other because they act like animals that don't care about human life.
yes Except....only water separates L. Ontario (Canada) and by N.Y. state. Look at the statistics
no Worse President ever!!!!!!!
yes https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/trump-lies-supporters-fans-believe-fake-news-facts-immigration-border-wall-a8781571.html
yes Sad for the loss of your daughter are the loss of anyones child to illegal invaders. We are Americans. The president is executing his responsibilities to the constitutional the United States.
yes Kris Landers if a known serial killer was loose in your neighborhood would you lock your doors? An illegal immigrant is a KNOWN criminal, therefore statistically more likely to engage in other illegal practices. Its really simple, logical, and moral.
yes PLEASE POST YOUR PROOF!
yes Thanks you my president! Make our country strong anh safety again!!!!
no You are not going to infringe on my Freedom of Speech as I will not infringe on your Freedom of Speech.
no Trump will take Billions from the Military, The Police and Dissater Fundd to fund the Wall.
yes Yeah that wall would of stopped him wouldnt it..
yes Uk British family not the people had no right signing the Belfour Declaration are they secretly Jewiish???
yes Thank you sir!
yes Go build the wall now
yes Dont use other peoples grief to push your personal agenda. Your own administration admitted the wall was not where the problem was. The border patrol themselves said the wall isnt the problem. Get your head out of your ass and address the actual problem. THE PORTS OF ENTRY. Every government body involved in the border knows it.
no You bet.
no Danny Jones I hope May makes no deal with the EU! You will prosper that way! Stay strong!
yes People who come to this country illegally and commit crimes and dont respect America and its laws make me sick, they should all be rounded up and put in concentration camps Id say(Im only talking about the fucking assholes) leave the good people alone and give em citizenship and health care
no He isn't trying to get elected over , he is trying to use the death to stop more deaths and the FATHER is agreeing.
yes Dave Callender this is awesome man! Godbless my brother!
yes Thank you, Mr. President.
yes All the mass shootings I believe have been committed by white Americans.

no Kris Landers the point is that if you ignore one Law,  you probably think you're above any Laws.  My sister in Law came here legally, loves and respects this country and feels others ALSO need to wait in line and do it legally like she did!
no Yes no more killings
no Were with you President Trump.

yes Should of moved back to Europe. She woulda still been alive. Oh well another illegal European gone.
no Thank you Mr.President.  I agree. After having finishedreadingI  thought that you should push forward measures to prevent such a sad event by all means in the same way.
yes Build the Wall....
yes " BUILD THE WALL NOW "
yes Illegal immigrants drive in America without insurance and cause accidents, which drives up peoples insurance rates, they eat up lots of resources that are meant to be provided for our fellow Americans.
no You would want people to knock on your door, instead of illegally  coming into your home.
yes Jim Smith No, a concerned American citizen who cares about our country. I have a right to my opinion just as you do. Can I call you a TROLL for disagreeing with me?????
yes We're all living in mama bear snake pit. I gotta take a chit right here in mama bear snake pit. And when we die she gets all our pills from our medicine cabinets for that toothless old hags' opiod thrills. I sing it to the tune of "yellow submarine".  It doesn't bring my dog back but it helps me cope with that toothless old hag. She's not my wife. I would never let that hag touch me.  She's just a vindictive evil old toothless miserable old hag.
no Chris Mallory   Not quite zero.
yes Besty, you don't get it.  If we don't put the wall up there won't be any resources to help those who really needs it.  First things first, secure the BORDER
yes So very sorry for your loss. I hope the wall gets built for all our sakes.
no Build the wall!!!!
yes Lyzbeth Martinez Puga make me chump. I'm sitting right here, walk off the reservation and show make us coward.
yes So sorry for your loss! We need the wall!
yes The chair for a high ranking democrat. They support illegal has great automotive citizens.
no SirKeenan Burgess go back where YOU belong!!
yes How do drugs get into prison if they have walls?
no Was that another illegal in Aurora Illinois?
yes Go for it and dont listen to the Naysayers like Ann Coulter Etc. she definitely has her priorities mixed up. I dont know what happened to her.
yes https://www.cato.org/blog/murder-mollie-tibbetts-illegal-immigrant-crime-facts
no You could write the Constitution on his forehead
yes Not from American born nut jobs with guns it wont...  priorities.....?
yes Draft dodging warrior huh?
no BUILD THE WALL  MAKE AMERICA GREAT
yes Lisa Vocelka No you libtard you need to build that wall and evivt the illegals, Bad the magic Kenyan done that as he promised this guy would noy have lost his daughter to an illegal scumbag.
yes If Democrats are smart they would just give him the money he wants. Now that he's moved on this and the fact this is such a polarizing subject, if this trickles to the next election good luck winning.
no AMEN !!
no Go Trump
yes Amen amen amen
no Yes keep going
no Millions of Americans are behind you 100%! Keep fulfilling your campaign promises and we will get you reelected in 2020. The Democrats will eat there own.
yes How many more young women are killed by Americans than illegals?
yes Some white co workers ate by breakfast tacos. Build the wall
no Those that support this action are supporting fascism. If you want fascism then get out of my country.
yes Well maybe you got some TBI now.
yes Everyone knows that legal citizens never kill anyone.
yes Temicka Brown at least it'd be a free ride home
no Agree walls work
no Build it!
no Eva Graham I think Trump should be the one to be impeach and put cinder blocks around his feet and put him deepest part of the ocean
yes Yes build a strong wall
yes Curtis Rice statistically people who give answers with false facts are fools.
yes Debbie Bauman white people drive drunk every second.  AND
yes Nora Arevalo ground penetrating Sonar. Was invented in the 60s. Seriously, google it, it's not that hard.
no My neighbor's daughter was killed while visiting a friend in Detroit. I want a wall around Detroit!
yes So would free health care. That would help a lot. How about our doctor's being able to practice medicine according to their oath and NOT answer to the insurance man. That might help. Release the free energy patents. Leave the wall down build a hemp trade and build a better earth.
yes We agree with you 109%, President Trump. Thank you for trying so hard to protect us all (EVEN the jerks that have been against you since day one )!  God bless you and your family greatly, Sir!
yes Some of you are just missing the whole point of the fact illegal means illegal no matter if they are killers or sweet little old ladies...ILLEGAL means they are not supposed to be here without going through the immigration laws and procedures...smh
yes Veronica.. you are being played by Mr Trump's satanic bilderberg group Freemason demons.  They are the MSM, CIA, KKK, ISIS and skull and Bones fraternity and Russell trust that are doing ALL the human trafficking and heroin and fentanyl manufacturing in the world for the past 243 years thru the US embassies and Rothschild Freemason colleges and council on foreign relations and Bohemian Grove club.   SO Sorry.. but paying the 9-11 bombers $$$ for a stupid senseless wall is not going to fix anything..
yes Why aren't the moms of American civilians murdered in shooting sprees by American citizens called "angel moms" too?
no President Trump!  I've heard a statement made by you on a Non-Local Media Website that may or may not be accredited, but it mentioned that you were going to stop the Mennonites, their drug trafficking operations, and other reports that state that the Mennonites and Mormons are working together in Chihuahua, Mexico and are corrupting Mexican Officials!  And since we all know the whole ordeal spread throughout Mexico and South America!  It's big!  Thanks!  But have you ever thought about stating that specifically in front of the live Broadcasts, rather than pointing out the various groups of folks being hurled into this, due to the Jewish Sects if Amish, Mennonites, Quakers, and Mormons!!!!
yes #Impeach #TrumpForPrison #AbuseOfPower
no Mr.Donald J.Trump The Great
no #buildthatdamnwall
no The fact that democrats are still trying to argue this is completely ridiculous.
yes I bet the 5 families that lost thir loved ones to another mass shooter this week  Think THAT's a National Emergency.   Whats the plan for that?
yes Anthony Clark  Corrupt leaders. Fix that first. And last I heard.. They are!
yes Without a doubt Those who disagree put other things before our citizens lives and the safety of our country
no I hate to say it but, Pelosi and Schumer will see things differently if an illegal took care of one of their loved ones...
yes Joseph Nowik I feel sorry for you. You can't be happy about any how well our country is doing. Maybe Venezuela is a better fit for you. TRUMP 2020!!
yes No it wont nice try the worst human trafficking is here in Michigan is u going to stopit here.
yes Robbie Reid look in the mirror.
yes Here is an idea... there are 2,738 prisoners on death row, with the average time spent on death row being 15 years.  Each prisoner costs the government a minimum 31,000 per year.... that is 84,878.00 per year if you multiply that times 15 years... wow 1.2 billion, if we could shorten the time on death row to one year instead of 15 we would have a great solution for funding of the wall. Just saying.
yes We have more mass shootings than all other countries combined and you do nothing, but three people were killed by illegal immigrants last year and its a national emergency?
yes Thais esses comments sao legendary low key
no This crisis has existed for decades and didn't get any better after you kicked off your 2016 campaign. But you did NOTHING for two years. Meanwhile thousands more Americans have been robbed, raped and murdered. Enough talk. Start building the damned wall and kick-start deportations of ALL illegals.
yes Kevin smith, ha so you believe in an armed revolution very gung ho of you to recommend that to the UK. Be we are not Gun mad unlike you lot who don't deal with the problem thats killing your kids
yes Ron O'Hearn either way license or no license people still need to drive to get to places like work
no I'm sorry for yr loss
yes God bless  President Trump,
yes An American citizen who was not supposed to own a gun killed 5 innocent people yesterday in Aurora, Illinois. Too chickenshit to talk about that?
yes Lisa, the wall may not be a perfect solution, but it will take considerable effort to go over it or under it. There are areas of the border that allow anyone just to walk in. No resistance whatsoever.
yes Jan Lynn Simpson  Prioritize all you want .  Build that wall . Then build more of that wall . We just can't get to much wall .
yes Illegal drugs killed mine Fake media and uncaring Demolition Dems haters of Justice & citizens & security sanctuary for illegals and homeless & criminals what can we do these fools are evil
no Eva Graham Pelosi is smart impeach Trump
yes Keep strong. Sorry for your loss! Wall should have been done years ago!!!
yes Lisa Mann yes Americans kill Americans..... doesnt mean we should import murder and other violence.  Ahhhh there it is.....  hes rich, he can pay for it......   moron
yes Great job mr president dont give up the fight. The swamp is worse then anyone ever thought
yes How much insulin could be bought with the wall money to save those who can't afford it...know any diabetics?  How many homeless Veterans could be placed with the wall money?  How many crumbling bridges or roads could be fixed with the wall money?  How many schools and businesses could be protected from gun violence with the wall money. There are far worse emergencies in America today, and you know it. Which is why you are at your fancy resort stuffing your face with omelettes and playing golf. Shame on you.
no The spending bill should not have been signed. Too much money to support illegals and restricting where the wall is built.
yes American soldiers went in Middle East and killed hundreds of thousands of innocents. Build that wall and stay inside yourselves
no Asha Artis the innocent illegal I guess. Bet you would feel differently if this was your kid. Bet you would be calling for the end of illegal immigration also. https://fox17.com/news/local/undocumented-immigrant-snuck-into-lebanon-home-raped-6-year-old-girl
no Build the wall...we the people should vote on the wall..
no Our  sympathies  Build the wall Build two. Walls 100 yards apart.
yes Donald Trump is 100% right
yes ....and a white person killed how many innocent people in Las Vegas...how many innocent kids got killed by a white kid while at school..how many innocent people got killed while watching a movie at a movie theater by a white person..how many people got killed while attending church services by a white person..just asking for an illegal immigrant who only comes to do a job a white person doesnt want to do..
no Nancy Hissa Is nevyconfuse a real President Obama, with a fake one!
no Lisa Mann sovereign countries have borders AND walls. Walls work. Fact.. That's common sense.
yes Wall all the way
no #YuriGiovanni
no Yes, we must all understand that a sample size of 1 is NOT statistically significant!   But, statistically speaking, there is a higher chance of you being killed by a fellow citizen than by an immigrant!    #MyopicPresident
yes Linda Gurtz Hildreth probably fake ones like the Obama birth certificate.
yes My Heart... The declaration of a state of emergency should have occurred at the beginning of 2017... And not now...
yes So sad.. May she RIP.. GET THAT WALL UP QUICK..
yes You have to be a special kind of stupid to believe that...
yes Louis Messier you need nothing. Yoz need an other Goverment you insane naive Corrupt Bigotic Blasphemic TROLLS of Trumpsupporter the lowest Level of the USA Society.
yes why did you wait? you had the house and the senate... if you don't get re elected there's gonna be hell to pay! but you are off playing golf!
yes Curtis Rice Don't make posts when you are drunk.  I did it before and it always comes out wrong.  Just trying to help.
yes Nora Arevalo have you heard of mole traps?
yes Every mass shooting in 2017 was carried out by American born Christian males!
no Need the wall AND total immigration reform: end of birthright citizenship, etc.
no A strangers apology means little. But as Parent and Patriot there is ZERO tolerance for this. We have OSHA for work place regulations, to the point most can no longer DO THEIR JOBS. Yet we allow THIS. Inact few laws & slmost no regulation that we actually deploy. Sickening. God Bless and God Speed to your lost loved ones. I will fight for our Freedoms and Sovereignty (foreign or domestic) until I can no longer. Which means if I'm lucky, I'm 80...and still have an eye and steady hand!!!!!!!
yes Where is my Trump bonus? Taxes are terrible this year? National debt has increased by $2 trillion! What was your Tax this year?
yes Should we deport all white people to Europe then?  Almost every single mass murderer is White.  Huh?
yes Trump has done nothing but spread hate and divide this country.the big tax break was for the rich and 72% of Americans will have to pay back money. Did you know the rich don't have to pay federal taxes? The rich take care of each other.  Trump is not taking any pay for being a President because its being made up by all the extra money from his tax break. I didn't say he wasn't stupid.
no As the wall is being built, I hope Mr. Trump will take other measures to keep criminals out of our country.  Anyone else feel this way?
no NOT WHEN SOME OF PEOPLE'S That is already here in the u s a  then all they doing is bringing in a hellve lot more here just like the Mexican PEOPLE'S who came over by one of the Mexican gril that was seen on ((Monday)( and she was with a white man then she was muder by a black man )) and why was she killed ? And Why do woman's go have naked  don't they know that they asking for anything can happen too them !!! And on Monday she was with another girl and what had happened to the other one then this one was posted on Facebook
no Thank you President Trump...
no I see the Callender family is full of idiots. Those must be fun family dinners, full of self hatred and victimization. 
yes John Burks stops the inmates from walking out and taping your mother or wife though....
yes I hope the wall doesnt work so everyone who is for it looks even more stupid.
yes Fantastic President trump you are doing a great job for all American families. Keep up with good job.
yes Lisa Mann no, it will be difficult to go over, and it will have cement footers.  Since you will be able to see through it, border patrol will see digging or other things that could show other avenues around the wall.  The slats make it difficult to go through.  So, with other things that Trump asked for, like more agents and technology (which was in his package they denied, and then passed with 1.4 billion for a wall) the wall will slow down any potential illegals.  If by chance they could make it across, they will be apprehended immediately,  which doesn't happen now in areas without barriers.
yes Soooo there are no home grown "white" bad people?
yes Veronica Torres, What Do you mean by they??? By the way are you Hispanic? If you are, I just hope that you are kind, to the undocumented immigrants, because sometimes they can experience the worst cruelty from their own kind.!!!
no Kathy Finley Hayden its way more than 35%
yes I should have known that David was from the left coast, land of fruits and nuts! !!
yes Janie Rogers Doss   True. But that would be 17,200 less if Republicans would get their heads out of their asses and the NRA out of their pockets.
yes Corey Groff sure  how about we do SOMETHING about the real national emergency?
no All that money going to that wall could help people who can't afford health care who need assistance with mention health
yes We support you and fully agree with you!!! Build that wall because Congress and the Democrats don't know how the rest of us live and go through. The rest of us don't have a security detail or the money to invest in high quality security systems.
yes Please make them razor sharp, and able to electrocute - evil 
yes Its against the constitution by using money from the treasury
yes Oh, sweetie...that degree from Trump U. didn't serve you well.
yes Bad people walk on through imaginary borders.
yes Bush gave the MONEY for the damn wall, to OBAMA TRAITOR! They all wanted the damn wall long  ago, SHOULD ALREADY had the damn wall! Hell with Congress for all this B.S.
yes Mr President dont forget america is build and made from emigrants from all over the world
yes Danny Jones why you say that ? What is your culture and  what going on ?
yes I'm very sorry you and your family have to endure such pain due to the Progress Liberal stupidity.
yes Betsy Hammond:How much money do you think could be put towards these issues if not for the billions of dollars spent on illegal immigrants.
yes Finish the wall...Trump 2020!
no https://www.facebook.com/423550194411366/posts/1736144173151955?sfns=mo
no So comes you aint sharing sad stories of those parents whose children are victims of gun violence; gun violence perpetrated by your supporters?
no Protection of American families, I guess military families don't fall under that category....https://www.foxnews.com/us/military-families-warn-of-unsafe-housing-rats-toxic-mold-and-more
no Emily Neal underground weapons will always make it into the hands of criminals thus we dont need to make laws making it harder for upstanding citizens with no record to own them!
no Barbara Samuel and you can CLEARLY see July 16, 2018/ 9:25am & 9:26am, you cant make that up can you?
yes Chet Bentley Yahweh (That's HIS Name NOT God) had NOTHING to do with her death!. WHO is responsible? Answer: The Evil One who I will NOT honor with a name because his name has never been removed or changed, JUST MULTIPLIED! Which ONE resides in YOU? PRAY NOW to be SAVED and SEALED in Yahweh the Father and Yahshua His Son, Revelation 14:1 HalleluYah! Hebrew: "Praise ye Yah!!"
yes HELLO DONALD, you are building a wall to protect your population from the immigrants, but you are asking for immigrants and terrorists from the Middle East and Africa. In addition, you are still responsible for ISIS, for the entire situation in the Middle East named friends of Syria. What kind of person are you ???
no Corrupt 45 doesnt care about all the parents who had their little children killed at school. Corrupt 45 doesnt care about the Americans killed in the Las Vegas Massacre! Corrupt 45 doesnt care about the kids killed at that night club outside of Los Angeles! Corrupt 45 doesnt care about the 5 people killed yesterday. Corrupt 45 the worst president in American History!
yes The wall around Obama's property works, yet he doesn't want a wall to help our country.
no 5 Americans killed in Aurora, Ill yesterday by an American.  This was one of many mass shootings by fellow Ameicans.  Border Security, Yes!  Everyone wants Border Security. But one illegal immigrants crime doesn't justify the expense of building a Wall that experts say can't serve the purpose for which it is  being built.
no Literally the last opinion we should be listening to.
no Dave Callender.  Don't be asinine.
yes 100 % right the best president in my Lifetime for sure
yes So sad, to much of this happening.  Build the WALL
no Ok lets put it to u this way if you baby was on the other side of the wall crying how many ways could you think of to get to your baby sit down and write down all the pros and cons then on another piece of paper it the Military was holding your baby list all the ways you think you could honestly do to get thru them to get to you baby
yes So sorry for the loss of your daughter! Pray for Trump!
no "Fixed fortifications are a monument to the stupidity of Man." George Patton
yes I'm sure a wall would have prevented all the school shootings that happened last year
no #Greatestpotusever
yes lol
yes Eddie Almeyda my act of kindness today is not to respond to your misunderstanding.
yes American citizens with legally purchased weapons have been killing children in our schools - when will that be declared a national emergency?
yes Can America invade Alberta and make it the 51st state
no Veronica Torres precisely
yes SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS!  PRAYING FOR YOUR FAMILY!
yes How about all the daughters killed by Americans with guns, people that shouldn't have guns, what about that moeron?
yes Mr. Trump is right.
no God bless u and ur entire family
yes No wall!
yes Jeanie Railsback that is why we should take care of ourselves instead of running to doctors and seeking pharmaceuticals for the sniffles.
yes Trump you have reason, make the wall and accept immigrants with degree and real capacity to become a citizen of your country. I admire and respect your ideas. Socialism promotes chaos and help countries don't become poor, this way no one go try illegal immigration. :)
yes Sheryl Whitfield-Tolliver  Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR
no Marla Herring Huh?
yes Make America SAFE AGAIN!.........give Trump his Four Walls!!!
yes Lisa Mann no.
yes My husband and I support the wall!!
yes Nancy Pelosi And Chuck Schumer Just  approved  1.3 Billion Dollars  for Funding  to Build part of the Southern  Border Wall ,,,. So I take it that their 1.3 Billion funded part of the wall is Morally O.K   .But Trumps working on  funding for  5.6 Billion for another  section of the Southern Border Wall....This  is not morally Ok and wrong in Chuck and Nancy eyes  ?
yes How many maniacs have shot places up this year?
no The time has come to end illegal immigration
no Marxist communists have no socialist agenda and sit on the left to destroy all progress including capitalism. When cities get old they destroy them from within to build elsewhere at the expense of the nation states they prosper from. Study history 100 million people died under communist leaders and the media commie owned will not report it.
yes My friend was stabbed 40 times the illegal was just deported to Mexico.  That was his punishment.  And you wonder why I fight for the wall?
yes sorry to know  of your Loss
yes There is no reason for any person to enter the USA illegally
yes Bring in more troops to battle the gun violence in schools!
yes Sorry for your loss...For evil to exist ... all it takes is for good men to do nothing.
yes But all who live in america are illegal immigrants except ppl who have indian roots
yes Raphael Pulman  This is very insightful about the European Union (EU) government.  """ Dear Mr. Temple, Thank you for your supportive email. The EU president was not elected into his post and is meant to be the face of 450 million people in Europe.  There is no mechanism to remove him and no way, through the ballot box, that the people of Europe can hold him to account.  The European Union is a undemocratic and corrupt organisation that tries to force us to accept one EU currency, one EU flag and one EU state without the consent of the people. It is my job to fight against this and be the voice of free speech - again thank you for your kind message. Yours sincerely, Nigel Farage" """
no It's sad that the world has changed so we need to build walls for our protection
yes Amen. To that
yes This only helps to spread fear and hate amoung ignorants.
no Valerie Siggson  yep because Trump cant be bought!!
yes What are you talking about Worley????
yes So sorry for your loss.  But thank you for telling Mandy's story and I pray that her story will keep others from the same fate as hers.  Build the wall! Trump 2020
no Love you Mr. President.
no Absolutely!
no AMEN-people just refuse to see the danger!!!!
yes Go Mr. President, go. You are the best. Dimitris from Greece/Hellas.
yes With all due respect...this could have been done by any us citizen.  Not just a  immigrant.      This happens all the time in the US by us citizens.   Alchoholism is a  horrid disease.    Guns kill at much higher rates  as Americans purposely murder at much higher rates.
yes Guns knife's and baseball bats work to
yes Okay but anyone could've drank a few and got drunk. Illegal or citizen of the u.s
yes how many americans kill eachother every day
yes Michael Curtin  hi
no We need President Piglosi's permission before we do anything now. This is so wrong
no Only COWARDS Veterans Supplemental Support Network use military signal device to overheat citizens phones like the ones at 1218 & 1086 Goa Way Road Hedgesville WV 25427
no Larry Martin nope.
yes From Quebec - Canada - You're Right Mr. President Trump - You're doing a great JOB at White House in all areas - Just Fake News and people as them don't agree.  Stay strong with all your near collaborators - You are FANTASTIC  WORKING in the right way tirelessly to get the BEST.  Thanking you to be there - Love - Support- Respect - Pride since Day 1.
yes Now tell me Aurora shooter was here legally? Slovenian I think so
yes Nora Arevalo    yep, just like in Israel, we will fill them up with cement.
yes #MAGAOTS
yes http://ourfilm.org/help
yes deplorable TrumpTurds > Ann Coulter: Trump Trying 'To Scam The Stupidest People In His Base
no Every single one of you people are of illegal ancestry. None of you are legitimate.
yes Every sanctuary city should be held accountable for these crimes. If it comes to light that an illegal was released instead of reported, then commits any crime, victims should be allowed to sue for damages.
no Priority as high as that dudes forehead HAHA!
yes Simon Kitson ... didn't donnie mention chain migration? Does he mean melanoma's parents?
no HELL YA MAGA 2020 , on cnn the other day they had a republican congressman and she was saying walls wont stop anything.   He said your absolutely correct BUT since we built barriers we used to have 150,000 crossings a year. Its down to 15,000...... so ya.... the dems are a joke...... Ill take 15,000 to 150,000......
yes We need to correct the narrative. It is not Trump's wall, it's America's. I believe Congress passed a motion to build a wall but just never got around to funding it.
yes Adam Somerville One angel family does not a crisis make!!!!  Trump declares national emergency...  Nobodys done the job that weve done on the border,  said Donny as he declares a national emergency today........the slowest emergency in history.  And with the lawsuits that will ensue, his wall will not be funded or built until after the next election...if ever.  THE WORLDS SLOWEST EMERGENCY!!!!!  Donny lied directly to Americans about his border crisis.  Our Liar-in-Chief said that all the data that refutes his crisis designation is lies.  Got that?  Our president told the American people that THE FACTS ARE LIES...this is what all wannabe dictators say.  This egomaniac is THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!  Donny doesnt seem terribly concerned about this crisis.  He plans to travel to Florida mere hours after declaring the emergency from the White House. A president, in times of strife, would typically stay in the nations capital to oversee the crisis. Donny plans to do so from the comfort of his weekend getaway.  In reality, Donny is preparing the country for a fake war as he plans to enjoy a mini vacation. The only national emergency in America right now is one of leadership!!
yes You know what would protect our families more than backward logic straight out of the 1st century? Healthcare for all, increased funding for schools, environmental protections, better wages. But you keep sticking to your regressive guns, champ
no An illegal immigrant committed a hit and run on my husband and I while we were riding our motorcycle.  We were left for dead in the middle of a road.  Yes, we need the wall.
no Dear God, please protect my family, my friends, this country from your lunatic followers. Amen. https://americasvoice.org/trumphatemap/
yes Do WE have LAWS.???  .......
no Why doesn't he report on the whites mass shooters?
no A madman killed 50+ people at a concert in Las Vegas  we must regulate firearms.  Or do we only use anecdote to make policy when it suits you ...
no Valerie how are you doing
no Sorry for his lost because we havent been protecting our borders correctly.
yes Keep them coming!
yes Scott Magers how have u been personally affectes by an illegal? just curious
no You're missing the point. Its called a deterent. It will make them have no choice but to use those methods and will likely be shot down or sunk if so.  Why do you have locks on your doors at home if someone can just ram a car through it or break in a window? Thats your logic
yes there should be a wall build around all europe to stop imigrants from north africa
no Stephen King they are trying
yes You missed the entire point of my post, Janie. Congratulations.   By your logic, everyone who dies by firearm wouldn't be dead if those were banned. Does that mean that we should ban firearms? No, it does not. Does that mean we should politicize gun deaths for the sake of taking gun rights away? No.   Please understand the complete hypocrisy before commenting again.
yes You been CHUMPED suckers  https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/average-tax-refunds-fall-fueling-discontent-with-gop-written-law?fbclid=IwAR2CctX_Dos3h7r6aS64kODkUYAv4hlJYNuLmU37nbGx_e6uHpCV_hVMicY&linkId=100000005061441&utm_campaign=newshour&utm_medium=pbsofficial&utm_source=facebook
yes The people who have had this happen should unite and sue the demon-rat-tick party.
no Kevin Llamas Jurez WOW really it amazes me how much stupid you can fit in your head.
no Build the Wall and let us keep America safe ...
no Tim Koepp  A wall wont fix it. Its a stupid idea
yes Really sorry for this persons loss but far more instances of mass shootings. A legal citizen killed groups of people in Vegas, Orlando, Parkland, Columbine, and San Bernardino.....Trumps not right and we need gun control.....so now what?
no Most of Orange Countys non illegal residents are for you president Trump. Newsom is NOT representing us! HELP
yes Adam Somerville yes, get trump out!!
yes Americans face consequences.  Illegals get deported and come right back. And....what about all the children that get trafficked through that border?  Oh I forgot, our country no longer cares about children
no How can you build a wall against gun massacre though idiot
yes Ps these shootings are from white American males. Let's put a wall around your butt
yes Not only complete it but install laws to prevent future issues and weedi g out the ones here uding and selling drugs. Guns. Or people.
yes An American white boy killed my brother, trump never brings that up does he?
no Such a high priority, in fact, that you waited two years to act and then went golfing right after you declared the emergency.
no What if we make being an illegal immigrant a capital offence? You have 30 days to buy a ticket and go home.
yes The same thing happened to me from a man that was a US Citizen and serving in the military. The point is these things happen and the people doing so will be legal and illegal at a proportion relative to their portion of the population. Just as my situation does not mean that men in the military are bad your situation does not mean illegals are bad........only that the individuals that perpetrated this on us were bad.
no Babi Nikki The reason black  people were brought here was black Muslims who captured and sold them to Dutch and Portuguese slave traders and brought them here to be sold to the American slave market. If you want to know where the origins are of your slave people look to your own black Muslims.

no #buildthewall best President ever!
no It is so sad Democrats have become the Anti-American party.  They have abandoned the American people.
yes Hal Eric Mitlitsky Obama already did that with his pen and paper!!
no you must close the loopholes in the immigration laws now.. also we must have term limits and voter i.d asap!
yes CliffandKim Ferrell ....they are desperate! Trump is winning for America and they cant stand it! Their hate for him is greater than wanting to see America win! How sad is that?
no CliffandKim Ferrell ....52% approval!
yes Joseph Nowik they cant touch the 2nd amendment but nice try
no ASAP and on
no Let's get this done! Once and for all..
no Its your number one job as The President of the United States. And youre doing everything in your power to protect us. Not Mexico or any other part of  the world.  Now Democrats apparently work for everyone but Americans and the United States. Lol. They kinda need to. No one trusts them anymore
no Hey Dude.....Rebuild America's Middle Class......You're The Smartest Man that's Ever Lived......You Can Do It......!! You're a Big Boy.....!!!
yes How about, we regulate who is buying the firearm!!?? Makes more sense to me. Regulating the firearms, isn't going to solve the problem. Look at the UK, they took and regulated those guns, so evil is jumping into vehicles and running over people in mass numbers, folks are being stabbed with knives. Yeah, regulating firearms worked for them didnt it
yes Toni Saunders how are you
no God bless America and God bless president Trump.....the true American leader.....he loves our country.....
no Hello here
yes Lori Olson Rasmann American taxpayers have paid for border walls in 3 other countries. What you should be thinking is why the democrats dont want a wall. They dont want it not because it wont work but because it will, and they know it.
no Hayden Blair sueing is just going to tie up the funds I didn't say he wouldn't get the money. Moving the bases and starting training exercises would just be a cheaper  option that would get us a more effective boarder control almost immediately. He would still build the wall as funds became available  And would make the wall more secure even after it was built
yes Need build the wall...President Trump do the right thing...
yes They wasn't killers and murders when you hired them in Trump Towers.. you can't get what you want like a little boy you fallout because people don't play with you
no Seeking asylum is not illegal.
yes We support our President!  Build the wall!
yes No they dont, no it wont, and if you cared about the safety of American families youd be doing things that actually matter (like gun control)!
no Thank you, President Trump, For keeping  your Oath: The Oath, as stated in Article II, Section I, Clause 8 of the U.S. Constitution, is as follows: "I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
no Thank you
yes Tim Masters he didnt veto it.  Yesterday you said it shouldnt be an emergency order.  Now the government will spend millions more in court fights.
yes Build the wall!! I support President Trump. I want immigrants to come into our country legally after they have had sufficient background checks. I want a safer America for my children and grandchildren.
yes Dianna Adams Ewen  yes I have thank you
no Maria Nichols ....yawn.....
yes What a joke, the guy cant make a simple point about his country losing it's identity without it turning into a race issue.
yes the 2A was written to protect us from libtards...the side of castro, mao, lenin, stalin, che, infanticide, abortions, kkk robert byrd, kkk governor northam, margaret sanger, rapist impeached clinton, pedophile jailed anthony wiener, maduro,...just wish democrats would stop shooting up all these places, and more importantly stop turning all prosperous countries into killing fields..
yes Hey look, its racists who think all immigrants are murderers. Thats Trumps key demographic.
no God bless Trump!
yes #TrustthePlan #EVerify #VoterID
yes The 56 laughing at this, I right now am requesting a #PrayerAvalanche for you and now whatever comes, is on you... Maybe if you had had a different view on things, it may have been different. Thoughts be to you... 
yes Ed Wrany you mean best Idiot ever in this Planet.
yes Yes support the wall. Sorry for your loss.
yes Apple Rivera  GB was stable before joining the EU? You really are ignorant of fact. Unbelievable. Why comment on something you clearly have no knowledge of - you just make yourself look incredibly stupid.
yes Build The Wall!
yes All the mass shooters I know they were legal white people, but at court the judge said they were mentally unstable....
no Sad. But there are many more deaths from gun violence. When will you declare that a national emergency????
yes https://youtu.be/OYcpiokCRHo REVERSE WORLD MAP. BECAUSE: ROUND.
no they invade us....we invade them. let's see who's better at invasion.
yes Keith Webber Jr.; last post 2015. Comments are full of these revived, foreign, and newly created Facebook accounts to show support for propaganda and spread discord.
yes Mike LeJe some people misread the 2nd amendment. It says "to provide for a militia..." more people should study history to understand why that amendment is there.
yes Build it and make it so the Democratic nation cant take it down.
yes All you folks who say that walls don't work are either stupid or too blinded by liberalism to see past the end of your nose. If walls don't work then why are their walls around prisons, the vatican, military bases, the white house, rich people's estates , and countless other places where access is restricted?
no Why didn't you acknowledge the Parkland students on the anniversary of the shooting? That is a real crisis. You're full of crap.
yes George E Simpkins Jr  and just like Trumps point, it has nothing to do if the person who killed this guy daughter was illegal or not. Or his point is that if youre legal you have the right to kill?
yes trump should just send im thoughts and prayers-like he did the other day to the families of the victims of the Parkland shootings.
yes If the wall had built 20 years ago, how many people would still be living that were killed by illegal immigrants and chain migration people?  That would be an interesting number.
no Raja Ali none
no We have a fence to my backyard and someone went over it
no and Militarize it!
yes Build the wall !!!
yes David Thoreson because you had that vision right David ?
no So where were you when Obama was shoving his crappy health insurance down our throats?  Where were you when Obama was sending billions to our enemies in Muslim countries?  That idiot had so many executive orders it was mind blowing.  He thought he was God!!
no build the damn wall !!!!
no Thank you...President Trump!! Stay strong!! We love you Mr. President 45
no Andres Zapata sorry, you missed the point. 90% of all illegal narcotics come from you guessed it, The Honduras. across Mexico, over the border to mainstream America via. MS-13.  And no, everyone responsible for own decisions, just like my son. However, if there wasn't any available, No Addictions, and/or 300,000 deaths of overdoses! Got it?    #buildthewall #nationalemergency #stopthedrugs
no James Anderson If youre thinking that bump stocks and large magazines should not  be illegal, that the legal age for purchase should not be 21, and that we should not improve access to mental health programs then you support the perpetrators of these mass shootings that constitute a real national emergency.
yes Declares a national emergency. Flies to his resort and goes golfing. Suckers !!!
yes Good pick
no Illegal drugs killed my beautiful young grandson. One of 135 that day. Why would you resist a President that wants to spare us from all this? Pray it is never your child Liberal.
no How much are the cartels, coyotes, human traffickers, paying in brtibes to Democrats to keep to Border Open for them?  there is no other reason why Open Borders ....
yes I am an angel mom...my 20 year old son died from a fentanyl overdose in 2017...build the damn wall
no Jacqueline Alas exactly!
no Pretty please?  Japan?  Please??!!  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-wants-nobel-prize-795962/amp/
yes Despicable use of someones pain and loss for selfish reasons. Youre awful.
no I'm sorry for your loss. But then, how about white males shooting up schools and theaters? This is utter hypocrisy!
yes Dennis McCullar if lives is the criteria,  then gun violence and the opioid epidemic are greater emergencies.
no Maybe if some of these protestors could feel the pain and loss you have they would have a different opinion.  I pray God will comfort you and all the others who have suffered this great loss.
yes Timmy Macneil
no Patti Piccione Zambuto  Its not President Trump that is for murdering Babies, that is the Liberal Socialist Democrats.
no You people are really dumb
yes If you really cared about the lives of American families, you would declare a national emergency for gun reform since more lives are taken by guns, than illegal immigrants. Gun reform would be much more effective and cost less than your 8 billion dollar wall.
yes We have more HOMEGROWN terrorists...tRump's a bigly fool.
yes Americas in debt y'all,  why don't we use this money to pay back the Chinese instead or something more useful then a fucking wall 
yes That fucking forehead, Christ
no Build that wall ASAP
no So if a neighbor kills a bunch of kids in a school, or in a church or a music event, shouldnt we declare a national emergency and deal with the threat? Get real.
no Fake news
no Why it was built by the past Presidents?????  If that wall is not important let the Democrats to destroy it and make an open border to all !!!!!   That's what they want????  Funding to secure? / Wasting for protection?
yes DONT BE A SHEEPLE TO THE PRESIDENT, THINK FOR YOURSELF!!!!!!!
yes All the Dems care about is illegals, invaders and criminals
no If I read the case well, what caused her death was drunk driving, not illegal immigration
yes The driver was wrong but this is why you LOOK and pay attention when using a crosswalk. Just like you should never rely on the safety of a gun, you cant rely on people not to be idiots and blow through red lights. This is a drunk idiot problem, not an immigrant problem.
no Such a sad story but a wall is not going to stop the madness!
yes Eric Morrison blame the business who hired them
no To Angel mom's & families,  The world is watching  politicians devalue your existence,  that of your beautiful loved ones for self serving agenda.  Justice will come when these  politicians are removed.   Blessings for you're strength,  perseverance in the name of validating their lives, as worthy.    Thank you,  American Deplorables
no Bottom line we need wall
yes Linda Durbin   You mean working so hard on the golf course? You have to stop drinking the Kool-Aid. It has seriously affected your health.  Republicans think we hate Trump more than we love America.  The truth is, we hate Trump because we love America.
yes Mitch Haynie hey moron check the FACTS most illegals are visa over stayers that arrive on planes and boats not jumping over walls you fucking retard
yes They bring in fentanyl which killed my nephew.
no Even heaven has a wall and it's not an easy one to get into
no Yes sir that is sad about that girl that Nancy could care less about
yes Thank you for trying to keep us safe!!!!! Build the wall!!!!!
yes Sandy Seaney Mahady, make sure your relatives are not in schools where an active shooter might enter
yes Sharon Fantana there is no big tech equipment that is going to physically stop a vehicle from driving over the border in a place like Arizona. Also if they have to build tunnels to traffic this takes time and resources of the cartels. We've been building barriers under the last several presidents. The fact is some people just dont like Trump and use it as an excuse to oppose him but that does not change the fact of what works down here and unless you have been out in the field chasing this stuff you really can't understand how much it slows them down for us to get to these places especially the more remote ones.  As far as Mexico paying for it. Like I said we've been building barriers and paying for it under the last several presidents. Now I have not read the full new deal that replaced  NAFTA but from what I've seen, been told, and understand is that we're getting a huge swing of money our way essentially paying for the wall. He never said they were going to dish out cash. There are other ways to make them pay. IR tariffs, new deals in our favor etc. People tend to be too narrow minded to think about those things because the mainstream media just pushes what they want. That's why it's more important then ever to do your own research and find the facts not just what they want to tell you.
no And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me.             Thank you Jesus for Trump and Pence.
yes THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF RACE KILLERS EVERYWHERE WITH OR WITHOUT A WALL.
no These people...
yes How many shootings are done by American citizens yet you haven't passed many come sense gun laws!
no Ed Wrany Yes!
yes No, it is not possible.  You can see for yourself by looking back, trump's wall idea was never something the majority wanted.
yes How much more is spent on catch and release programs that the dems want to increase more per year than the wall would cost? How much more does it cost for jobs working off the books so taxes don't go where they should go, where the people working off the books get hurt and can't get medical? How much more does it cost for the gangs that, for me, is walking distance from my house, and all the harm they do every single day. There were over reported 1,000 crimes in the town that was my school district's town last year, about four reported crimes a day. On my way to work, depending on the time of day, there are about fifteen day laborers waiting for off the book work in an area, usually two or three groupings of men who are perfectly capable of work, which means they can't legally get work, which means they're criminals or not here legally. These are jobs that would pay better with benefits if it was done right. We need better policies for immigration control, and we need better ways for people to come here legally. In my eyes that means we need a wall with guards, but we also need more agencies out there to speed up the process needed for those who should be here legally to do so. We need what Ellis Island was, but in New York, California, and Texas, with branches set up in each state that reports back to those three places. We need an overhaul. We need a wall. We can fix things from there.
no The KKK kills people everyday.   Where's the wall
yes Carl Ostendarp better than New York where  you would killed them
yes Danny Jones haha "your" culture? Have you ever read a history book? Or can't read?
yes Mr president wall don't work , that's a waste of funds, take care of the veterans. This way you will always be great.
yes NO BRAINER; DEMOCRATS ARE OUTRIGHT CRAZY!!!!!!!
yes Kim Miller  lol lol I love when you idiot say this! I do! So your cure is to take guns away from non criminals so that when criminals Illegally get a gun theLaw abiding citizens can't protect themselves! You definitely are a Dem! Lol No better then Obama care or the new universal health care that your demoRATs want to try AGAIN????
no Build It!!!!
yes It must be done!  If it saved only one citizen's life, it would be worth it.  But it will save many more, than that!
no Complete it 100% for the ENTIRE length of the southern border please. Not just certain sections.
no Danny Jones what culture
yes Walls work? Let's ask about the great Wall of China.
yes An illegal hit my son with  my Grandson in the car also.The illegal was drunk and did it on purpose to hurt his wife.My son is disabled for ever.YES ----WE NEED THE WALL.The illegal had no insurance or license..
yes Sorry for your loss. #maga
no I've been on google maps and looking at the border. California has a really nice wall. SO they can have a wall, yet, they don't want anyone else to have one that needs one. There are already walls in a lot of places, but on google map, satellite view, you can see roads going to places that there are no walls... Walls aren't to keep people out, it tells them to use the door.
yes Sorry for your lost but the wall may not keep safe you and your family if you are at wrong time on the wrong place! Dont live your home ever!
no Daniel Alexander Allen this is the dumbest comparison on earth. Can't fix stupid is the real problem.
no Build the Barrier

no it's amazing how he was deported but managed to get back to the US, managed to get a car and drive around!!!! omg how could the authority let him do that so freely??? the state should be sued for this!
yes Obama Worst president Ever...
no I DECLARE A NATIONAL EMERGENCY FOR THE FUNDING AND SUPPORT OF OUR UNDERFUNDED AND OVERPOPULATED ANIMAL SHELTERS AND RESCUES, AND FOR WILDLIFE RESCUE AND REHABBERS...
yes Stop their money & benefits too
yes I think the American people have a generous instinct. They understand that we're a nation of immigrants. But if those folks are going to live in this country, they have to be put on a pathway to citizenship that involves them paying a fine, making sure that they are at the back of the line and not cutting in front of people who applied legally to come into the country.
yes liberals only care about illegals, votes and power, not american lives
yes You really need moron meds
yes Dante Noel perhaps you should pull your head out of your ass
yes Arguing about whether a wall works is a lame, diversionary tactic used by Trump-haters, period.
yes We are with you!
yes Raping
yes A dui. Common man that coulda been anyone. Dont get all political and bigoted because an illegal drunk driver killed her. Jesus
yes BUILD..THE..DAMN..WALL..ALEADY
yes He will get well over 10 billion through remittances from the USMCA deal he made with Canada and Mexico so yes!
yes So sorry for your loss.
yes Oh  sad
yes STEVEN MILLER on Fox News. Rhino Neo Con Chris Wallace trying to get him  to made a mistake. Wallace arrogantly trying to trip  him up. MILLER was magnificent. KNEW the Law.  If Miller had been sent to negotiate  a spending bill instead of Democrat Jared Kushner., Rhino Lindsey Graham and Mike Pence...TRUMP WOULD HAVE THE MONEY... Before 2020, someone needs to do an intervention and get Kushner Out of the White House. Ambassador to Israel? Tune out Graham. Not his friend.
no Tell it to the world. They are just selfishly trying to get voters for the next election. It's all about power. The don't care about  your love ones, America or Americans. Yell from the roof tops and we'll yell with you! The old ones need hearing aids, the young are tone deaf so get loud and make sure the hear you.
no Good evening
yes Alan Davies   Yes, America is a Republic founded on God.  We have Gods Blessing, until we turn our backs on Him.
no I'm with Trump  no don't about it.
yes My Name is Mr. Yogesh Pratap THANK GOD FOR MOORE FINANCIAL COMPANY LTD. I have been searching for a Loan to settle my debts, everyone I met scammed and took my money until I finally met MOORE FINANCIAL COMPANY LTD. I received a Loan of $25,000 From them. Within 5 hours after I applied. If You're interested in getting Loan Email: kellyloanfund@hotmail.com or Whats-app number +17347995059
yes Simon Kitson Im just messing with you, at this point...Im admiring your persistence, lol!
no So sorry for the tragic loss of your daughter. I believe President Trump will protect our country like no other.  May your daughters death and all others not be in vain.
yes If your thinking they should take guns away that would just make matters worse. Look at Chicago as that example.
no Robert Duncan I'll try.
yes Linda Durbin if youre a multimillionaire, hes working for you. Check your bank account, you may have been duped.
yes Larry Fields and the sad part is the left sees nothing wrong with this. And you are exactly right!!
no Why isnt mexico paying for it?  damn yall dumb
yes Ryan, you're a special kind of STUPID! !!!!!!
yes A wall will not make us safer #Dotard! Ever hear of ladders? Tunnels? How about simply cutting through the prototype steel that you're thinking of using?
yes So mr. Krabs you can't make money off everything through contracts and contractors that build the wall after your fake presidencies up .
no Thank you President Donald J. Trump.. after you announced the wall being built a heavy monkey off our backs..
no An illegal killed my dad years ago..
yes An illegal immigrant was drunk driving and killed NFL linebacker Edwin Jackson. News was mostly silent...
no TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP WALL WALL WALL.  Our great President Donald J. Trump will go down in history as the only president to fulfill all of his campaign promises!!!!
yes Sorry for your loss God Bless
no Herb Nachbar
yes So so sorry for your loss of a young beautiful daughter.
no Build the wall then dig a mote next to it so that they cant dig under it , then use the dirt and build another hill.
yes Mystique, What is your point?  other than we have ENOUGH Legal criminals so why are we IMPORTING them?????
yes Trump loves the poorly educated   https://www.facebook.com/mark.steward.1654/videos/1070211679808070/
yes Trump and his base of believers are like a cult. He claims his wall is already being built, when the truth is not 1 inch of his wall has been built yet. And his followers eat it up. A lot of Kool-Aid is being consumed! Lol
no John Jacob google trump Epstein Clinton. They are pals
no The first step is to recognize the problem, make a decision, and move it forward
no "Safe again"? So there was a wall before?
yes Simon Cardinal those are all problems we have to worry about, of course. There's no debate here. the point here is that the wall has nothing to do with the fact that somebody has been killed. the point is that trump is using a specific situation that has nothing extraordinary to prove his point on a global issue. You cant build a point on such an important issue by playing with peoples sentiments using tragedies. En fait c'est simplement de la malhonntet intlectuelle et cela est une preuve parmis tant d'autre que cet homme exploite les sentiments, les motions et des stratgies trompeuses dans ses discours afin de contourner toute rflexion rationnelle puisque c'est un terrain o il s'est avr tre incapable de gagner.
no All u dumb asses that dont think we need a wall. What if it was your family member
yes Adam Somerville Amen
no Linda Durbin So hard he blocked back pay for the federal workers who worked through his shutdown..
yes Eva Graham you are sad
no Respect from the U.K.  build the wall. MAGA
yes So sorry for your loss. My heart is very sad for all the Angel Parents caused by Devils here Dems gladly let in!
yes I wonder about the mental faculties of people who buy into Donalds propaganda messaging of hate and intolerance. The same people who feel the need to place blame in the case of unfortunate accidents. Small minded individuals who cant reason past the end of their noses. The same breed of people as the petty, vindictive moron child in the White House.
no Build it
yes Adopt the Texas law! Execute murderers regardless of citizenship.
yes Hal Eric Mitlitsky why wouldn't a wall work??? i want to hear your thought
yes The wall is pointless. They will still get through and trump is making it seem like immigrants are the main problem committing crimes etc when it's our own American people!
yes Trump!Trump!!Trump!!!
yes Shits beyond stupid. Let's just pull out of other countries and go to war with south America. This post is wack.
yes But how did this illegal get in? From Mexico? From the airport? Oversea?
yes Its time the US Government gets sued for tortious negligence for breach of duty in protecting our citizens.  This will put an end to the Liberal open boarders agenda, real quick.
no Maureen Hersey Brown becaus theyre braindead sheep!  They believe what the evil scum tells them!
yes Mr President have you heard of Tunnels.
yes Walls work very well in Israel to solve many border problems.  We can take a page out of their playbook.  Only millions of dollars to do about 500 miles, not billions.
no QUIT THE FEAR MONGERING..!!!!
yes ..Thousands and thousands of innocent people are murdered every year by "home grown" American murderers.....How come they`re NOT paraded before the public like this one committed by an illegal....??..I guess if you`re killed by an American it dosen`t matter because it dosen`t fit in with Trump`s BULLSHIT about his wall....
yes The wall needs to be built for American Security. President Trump is aware of all the violence in the border towns.
yes So sad....the left thinks voters are more important than the security of our own people.....4,001 killed in two years by illegal immigrants.....in Phoenix we have 7.5% illegal immigrants.....50% of all class one felonies are caused by the 7.5% of the population.....33% of all drug arrests are for the 7.5% of the population.... 74% of the 7.5% are on benefits for life...at least since the 1986 Immigration Reform Act.....
yes What happens if Mexico decides to build a big staircase on there side of the wall ?
yes What about people killed by police officers. Should we build a wall around police officers?
yes Craig J Grove I can't wait ! Locked and loaded
no In Chicago every 14 mins somebody is getting shot. The man who created the massacre in Las Vegas? All these shooters are "legal Americans"
yes Crazy people kill innocent Americans, I support gun control 100%, nobody with mental illness history should own a gun.
yes Send all illegal aliens back and their anchor babies
yes Renieri Ortiz immigrant does not mean illegal  !!!!
yes Build it!!!!
no How many legal citizens kill people in the United states daily?
yes Build the wall Build the wall Build the wall
yes 3000 killed by white men so we should build a wall around each person
no Dave Callender   Regardles of any crimes commitef by them after they get here,It is illegal  to sneak into the country,. When an american citizens break any laws we are held accountable.  They shouldn't be an exception. They  are criminals because they brpke  the law.
no Stay the course, Mr. President!
no Alberto Weisz hell no because then all the white crackheads will take my stuff!!
no Marcus Rech no I am protected by aliens. I was abducted and they taught me how electromagnetism from microwaves,tvs,cell phones,mp3 players can save my life. I also mainline fluoride cuz it not only protects my teeth but my bones are indestructible.
no Betty Bilbrey "The only national emergency is that our president is an idiot"  Ann Coulter
no Christopher Curry  According to the Democrats,  came through the port of entry and put his name on the list so they can keep account  (statistics), they talk about them all the time !
yes Enough is Enough!!!!! Prayers....Get this wall up!
yes We can't build the wall with our tax money because that's socialism! Let's make Amazon or Walmart or one of the big oil companies build it... about time they pay us back for all the subsidies they get.
no Linda Durbin working?  Building a wall is not much of a work if you might ask......
yes Crystal Maskell Carey what part of well regulated militia do you not understand?
no Still so many brainwashed programmed sheep
yes Wake up Democrats
no So sorry you lost your Daughter. I know Donald Trump is working hard to keep us safe  so many is trying their best to stop him.
yes A far greater problem killed over 70,000 last year...but it's Big Pharma getting rich, so trump keeps hands off. https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/5/18207386/trump-opioid-epidemic-state-of-the-union-2019
no Absolutely  If we don't have the funds to build the wall along our own southern border  Then stop sending American tax-payer funded financial aid to foreign countries, stop financial aid to illegal aliens, stop importing cheap labor, stop allowing and enabling US jobs and industries to be outsourced to foreign countries and do not import foreign fuel, steel nor electronics used in our military weapons, national defense systems and power grids  Build the wall and guard the border using our drone and satellite surveillance systems to find and turn back unauthorized intruders  Also, hire our veterans and former law enforcement officers to monitor and minimize visa over stays.  This is The United States of America, it's our country and being a US Citizen is absolutely relevant  What the American People clearly want and need are more elected officials that will actually start putting the best interests of our own US CITIZENS first and foremost, and that includes appointing judges and others that will do the same.  For the first time in 30 years, we finally have a president that's actually doing something about our traitorous trade and immigration policies  And the corrupt manipulative media, establishment puppet politicians and their globalist masters are blatantly fighting President Trump and the American People tooth and nail every step of the way.
yes BUILD THE WALL AND MAKE THEM GO THROUGH THE LEGAL CHANNELS TO COME TO THE US.
yes Chump you should show the crimes against immigrants there will be at least twice as many. You should be ashamed of yourself for politicizing tragic deaths to push your sick agenda.
no 100%
yes Protection and Defense. What more are the Feds good for?????
yes Impeach the Fascist Trump, NOW!

no Your all strong than me some hurts one of my children or a family member I wont stop I'd destroy everyone of there family and them
yes Build the Wall.
yes Why do people not want to be protected? Do you allow anyone off the street into your home without first knowing who they are? Of course not. Our country is no different. Can you go to any country you choose illegally and remain there illegally, taking federal aid, get a job, etc., with no paperwork? No! Why should America be any different? Come legally or dont come. My ancestors all came here LEGALLY.  Immigrants are wonderful and add to this country, but come legally as countless others have. Can we, as Americans, break the law without expecting consequence? No! Why should anyone coming to this land illegally be allowed to break the law of the land without consequence? Its just not that difficult to understand!
no its a globalist scam... allies wanting to defend each other shouldn't need to be coerced into doing so... either yah wanna help your homie ..or not

no Charlesetta Brown um...walked
yes Kevin McGrath   Are you still in Canada or Kansas?  Dont expect to see any walls there.
no I think anyone that dont support border security or that thinks its just not important is no different than the problem itself, anyone that wants to argue with facts that family members have been lost because of it are just idiotic  because they havent lost their family because of it so they wont know how it feels
no and Hamburgers are made by germans
yes Drunk drivers come from all walks of life. I'm sorry for the family. But it seems like alcoholism is the root cause of the epidemic that caused this death and thousands of others.

no How many immigrants desecrate American families by  committing these mass murders!
yes Behind you 100%!!!
yes The reason liberals and some so called republicans are so mad is because up until now every president since Reagan has given just enough money for a small section of wall to keep enough voters happy to keep getting re-elected. The liberals dont want the wall because it will keep their base from growing and ruin their idea of a world without borders. The republicans are afraid they are gonna upset the moderates and independents. We finally have a president that is serious about securing our country.
no Complete the wall
yes ORourke, a Democratic former Texas congressman and candidate for Senate, responded in an interview with MSNBCs Chris Hayes Thursday to a question tweeted by Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas), who asked whether ORourke would make the citys border wall disappear if he could.  Absolutely, ORourke said without hesitation.  Id take the wall down, ORourke said, adding that the barrier has not in any demonstrable way made us safer.  ORourke said the existing wall has pushed migrants and asylum seekers and refugees to the most inhospitable, the most hostile stretches of the U.S.-Mexico border ensuring their suffering and death.
no FAKE STORY ALERTS I jus don't believe there is truth in a lot of these stories with fake pages.  I think some of y'all jus giving fake testimonies to help campaign for TRUMP and trying to see who can come up with the best sob stories.  Republicans geeeesh!!!!

no Mitch Haynie Take your Meds, Mitch.
yes Get it done.  We need it.  Thank you, Mr. President.
yes And young white American citizens cause a thousand times more destruction. Besides, there was no intention in your brothers death, it was an accident. I am sorry for your loss, but blanket statements that equate an isolated incident to mass murder is ludicrous. Immigrants are not killing us, our own citizens are.
no MAGA TRUMP 2020 Mr President Sir  Build a nice big beautiful wall , very tall and very deep so they can not tunnel under

Same day he declares a FALSE National Emergency on the border our REAL NATIONAL EMERGENCY REARS ITS DEADLY HEAD AGAIN WITH 5 DEAD, 5 POLICE INJURED AS WELL AS OTHER INNOCENT VICTIMS. THERE IS NO PALATABLE EXCUSE FOR THIS TO CONTINUE.  There is NO difference between Angel Moms or any other family who has suffered this unimaginable loss by gun violence in our country by our own American citizens... DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT CONGRESS AND TRUMP...DO IT NOW!!! IT IS OVERDUE.
no Donald Trump, explain to this poor father why you are off playing golf after declaring a national emergency.  So much respect for respect for his dead daughter.

no Yes people we have several problems in this country mass shootings drugs illegal aliens and so on so forth.  We now have a president who is picking a problem and doing something about it.  Then we can move on to the next thing.   It may not be the fix all but even if it only keeps out half the drugs and illegal's that's a huge victory. Build to wall.

yes Temicka Brown funny, you do not blame the democrats running Flint .  They get money to deal with the water crisis and divert it to keeping democrats in office and their pet projects they get kick backs on.  But everyone else is suppose to fix the problem.    Grow up.
no Also I didnt say Mexico was paying for the wall
yes The vast majority of illegal immigrants that cross the southern border enter this country do so in cars through ports of entries how is the wall going to stop them?

yes Thank you and bless you, President Trump for doing what is right for the American people!!! Praying for all these families 
yes People die everyday
no fund the wall
no Like if immigrants are the only people in the world that kill people.  So much hate on the heart of this fake presidents.  White people kill more people than anyone in the entire history,  but wait that's "fake news " uh?
yes We also should not give any illegal immigrant any kind of benefits or welfare I think this would turn away a lot of them from coming into the United States.
yes Trump. Dude. You have been eating up the fake news for years now. Stop it already. Please. Resign. You are not qualified to handle this job. You are screwing up America.
yes Charlesetta Brown they are more than welcome IF they come in legally.  The problem is, the ones that don't come legally.  They have no right to be here period.
yes Kimberly Mansfield  yep by crazy people that have mental health issues!! If their parents lost control what the hell can President Trump do? Most murders are from illegal guns the wall will cut down on that too! People with guns need to lock them up better! Not a lot can be done about crazy people!!
no Anecdotes do not constitute statistical data. One, a hundred, or even a thousand do not represent a whole group.
yes BUILD THE MOTHER FUCKING WALL

yes Debbie Bauman close to my daughter's age. Do you track him still? What he'd be doing ? That sort of thing. He'd be 32 now? I'm sorry. He was old enough to know him as a man and the person he was becoming. Every year is a gift.
yes He's so big on immigration reform yet he employs  so many illegal immigrants and married one then had her parents come over here think about
yes Keep doing what you are doing
yes Wow, Jeffrey Dahmer, Charles Manson, Ted Bundy, thousands of American killers and donny plump is exploiting these families for his own twisted agenda. Did Mexico's check not clear? Over 7,000 lies told since taking office. IMPEACH now!
no Shooting? Lol damn Trumpbots
no We have enough problems with our own criminals! We don't need illegal criminals to compound the problem
yes Yeah liberal morons have been saying if gun control saves one life its worth it, but guess where most of the "gun violence" occures. Gun free zones and cities with higher gun laws. Yup how's that working for you libtards.
no Definitely yes thank you President Trump
yes Protection for American families? Then does this mean you will ban assault weapons?
yes Then why did you sign the funding bill that actively goes against your own goals?
yes HELLO.......they comes here for FREE (which we pay for) perks.  Stop all the freebies and they will quit coming right away.  Charge a hefty fee for sending money to a foreign country and walla, that will stop or slow down too.  And, lastly but not leastly, reduce or stop foreign aid all together.

yes These posts are old
yes Build that wall Mr. President I completely agree with you and support the idea of protecting our country. Im firmly in support.
no That means your stupid ass has to go too, you don't like it here then leave
no Donald J. Trump so my question to you Mr. President is why so much concentration on our southern border . I understand yes drugs do come from there but also what about by planes ,boats etc. Why aren't we focusing on other countries such as Russia,Columbia parts of Canada that supply cocaine ,herion and whatever else come from those countries?
yes Its not about the wall, its about that the bill provides amnesty for illegals, limits ICE and hampers our ability to throw the illegals out. I don't know why in gods name he signed that damn thing. Not to mention once again provides an unchecked slush fund to isreal
no President Trump, you forgot to finish your sentence because of the interruptions at the press conference, You didn't have to do this..... but you had to because Congress would not do their job to protect the American People.
no Yes!
no More legal citizens kill more people are you fkng kidding me. So idiotic.
yes Only fools think Walls dont work!  WALLS WORKED!  Look  around your house  and see what Walls do for you and your family!  If walls dont do anything for you, Tear those walls down!  Its simple as that!!! A message from a lowly lowly Master Sergeant (Ret),  USAF from San Joaquin Valley, California, a Ground Zero for Armed Criminal Illegal Aliens because of Sanctuary State Policy benefiting Illegals enacted by Corrupt, Greedy, Heartless, Lobbyists (Bribes) Loving Cynical Democrat Politicians led by Wicked Nightmares Creator and Anti-Border Security Speaker Nancy Pelosi!  #45MAGABUILDTHESOUTHERNBORDERWALLS
yes Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.

no What about those killed by the negligence of the opioid industry!? You accept Sackler donations don't you!?
yes Sharon Fantana

yes Easy answer..trumpers..
yes Jim Popper it's not fear mongering.....its common sense, but what do libtards know about that??
yes You yourself said, in Fridays Rose Garden announcement, that you did not need to do this now.  Of course, you wont play that part for your blind followers - gotta manage their perception of dear leader!!!  How can it be an emergency if you did not need to do it now and as you said, it could be done over several years?  You are one terrible leader.
yes sorry to say the wall will slow them down but not stop them.
no Why do all the liberals like Pelosi, Schumer have armed security, walls, home security systems to protect themselves, if they dont want a wall to protect American citizens?
yes https://boston.cbslocal.com/2019/02/07/access-to-guns-not-mental-health-responsible-gun-violence/
no Not trying to be rude but Americans do that all the time either drinking and driving or texting and driving causes accidents
no Kenny Shuster get your head out of your ass we need the wall
no American killed 2 of my nephews 3 decades ago.
yes God bless you, President Trump.

no Demand your da to prosecute governor mayor even senators who allowed the murder to be here there are laws against aiding and abetting also go after aclu
yes America deserve your services, please can you come over to Africa and change it completely different?

yes Don't trust turtle head, read everything.
yes Build the wall now!

yes Steve M Souza What happens when its not finished by the time hes out of office. Im sure you have an answer for that too. Even if he were to be re-elected, it wont be finished. There are literally mountains, rivers, and private property to contend with. Think about how long lawsuits will be drawn out.
yes BUILD THE WALL #TRUMP2020MAGA
yes :-)
no Joseph Tewell so how's your tax dollars that are being sent to Jordan to build THEIR wall helping you?
yes Kelly Anders wow, really?  50% of violent crime in America is committed by 13% of the population and they ain't white.
no Art Jackson Unless your numbers include the hundreds of millions of disarmed people that have been killed by their communist/socialist governements then you are pissing up a rope. But, by all means. Convince me.
no So sorry for ur loss
no OUR president has sent a solid and straight forward messege too not only the leftist in our country with yesterdays decision too declare a national emergency but he is making it clear to any tin pot dictators too boot on a few more levels of greater importance.....Give em hell Mr.President.....!!!
no Robert Cee wow you must be living in the twilight zone.  Here in the USA the urban dwellers are the takers.  They will not speak for the rest of the country nor should they.  People in big cities are ignorant of life outside of their little bubbles and can't think or do things for themselves.  Amazon just got run out of New York because of socialist A-holes who live in a fantasy world of progressive idiocy.
yes Curtis Rice inbreeding
yes YES AND WE NEED TO DO IT NOW. CONGRESS NEEDS TO QUIT ACTING LIKE A BUNCH OF JUVENILES.
no Damn right!
yes U BETCHA
no Diana Klausner ...I agree with you but honestly believe they are helping our cause in 2020...making it much easier for Trump to be re elected because a lot of people are seeing that party for what they truelly are.
no Sandy Theriault , lol building a wall to protect US citizens doesn't violate our rights. Do you really think people will just do nothing if they try to take away our right to bear arms. There wil be civil war if that happens. And I'm guessing the side with weapons will probably win.
no Why don't democrats what the wall? We all know walls work, not to mention, the same democrats that are against the wall today are the same democrats that signed off on a wall for the last 30 years. Pelosi, Schumar, all of them.. So what changed? The Bills were always signed and granted billions of dollars, Why are they against the wall now? But were for it in the past?
no Laura-Renee Mendoza
no Yeaaaa
yes He lost his home but he paid his worker and his venders because he was old school .  He told to file for bankruptcy too but his love for country and family did not let him do that . Now he is a broken man just because he believed in you . Are country is head in the same direction AMERICA awake up , this guy is no business man he is a CONMAN
no Bill Johnson are you less safe than 20 yrs ago?NOPE!!!!!!!!
yes Saves lives of border patrol too. They have family.
yes Maybe they should have built a wall around the Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora!  Of course that was an American male with a previous aggregative assault conviction who had a gun and killed 5 and wounded at least 5 others!! But dont worry about gun control, just build walls!!
no Build the wall Congress will never get it. Thank You President Trump for thinking of America first you got my vote in 2020 just like you did in 2016. Thanks for keeping you promise of putting America first. #MAGA
no There is a 10yr old an hour from here that would like to give her opinion but she can't. She was picked up at church and then raped, killed and her body stuffed down a well. The person who did it had been deported multiple times with an assault record.  Can you imagine how hard she was screaming and crying as she was being raped and then being silenced as she was murdered in cold blood. This was preventable. Now tell me how this was not preventable? She was only ten. She had her own dreams.
yes Is this a Russian post?
yes Carl Mrner Trumpcucks get hard off of dead kids.
yes Well what about the HOME GROWN white men's killing people in churches, in school's,  in outdoor  concert,running people down with cars,random shooting, no immigrant did this, nobody talks about this, and that includes trump. I guess we need a wall within states where all the violence  is going on.  Kids can't go to school,without fear of being murdered, you  can't go to church without fear of someone might come in and shoot you. We  desperately need gun control. You can't ignore facts, trump  haven't spoke out about this issue  Yet.
yes Julie your not really clear what your trying to say.
no Dee Dee Kelly Colvin never said it was did I!
yes Build the wall the government has money for whatever else they want

yes Humpty Trumpty promised a big wall, Humpty Trumpty said Mexico will pay for it all, But all of the 'King's' horseshit  and all of Fox News spin, couldn't hide that Humpty Trumpty was lying again!
no Daniel Alexander Allen these people don't understand logic you're wasting your breathe
yes "I'm declaring a national emergency."  "I could do the walk over a longer period of time, I didn't need to do this."  - Donald Trump 
yes The President has a Constitutional right to protect Americans... The court and lawsuit theatrics is such a waste,  and quite frankly,  Stupid!
no Ron Gagnon, yes 45, keep draining the swamp of that crap you keep filling it with. You know all the best swamp people. What a joke.
no #BUILDTHEWALL #PRESIDENTTRUMP use El Chapos seized money #THANKSELCHAPO

yes Yes we need that wall now
no So this illegal immigrant was arrested in 2017? Wouldnt it have been better to focus on locking him up instead of locking up the kids in camps? Im just a simple mind but it seems obvious that this is who should be locked up and not the children. Anyway, what do I know... I will still vote 2020. Btw, is it true with the national emergency I can also vote for him in 2024?
no Illegals coming into our country that add no value to our system, they suck us dry, take all the freebies they can and bring violence, drugs and gangs into our communities. Build the wall!!!

yes We must revise Immigration Laws, and enforce them. If you violate immigration Law you lose eligibility forever!
no Peter Fell lol. You poor man. You don't even know what day it is. You do know that believing a lie brings on a reprobate mind that's mental illness. Not knowing a lie from truth or right from wrong.
yes I agree with you.  I am so sorry about your loss of Mandy.   Please know there are many who are trying hard to get the facts out but it is difficult.  I do believe we will have a wall eventually.  Don't give up and all the best to you and your family!
yes Mr. Trump, illegal immigrants do not come just in southern border. I agree with the wall, but I hope you can solve the people who came here via tourist visa and overstay here.
yes An American with a Bump Stock killed 58 other Americans in Las Vegas.  Would a wall have stopped THAT???
yes Terry Smith amen brother
yes Melissa Corrente. Yoohoo
yes The Court: The President said he didnt need to declare an emergency, did he not?  Counsel: Correct.  The Court: And that he just did so because he wanted it done faster?  Counsel: Yes, your honor.  The Court: How on earth is that an emergency?  Counsel: Hasnt your time expired?
no Thank you President Trump!!!!! Please keep us safe:)
yes Was that an illegal immigrant that gunned down five coworkers and wounded five police the other day? The REAL emergency in the United States - gun violence.
no How many people were killed in las vegas or parkland or aura trump you don't care.
no Joseph Nowik its not an overreach. Since the 1970s therr has been nearly 40 national emergencies declared. Its only because it Trump the snowflakes are crying.
no Im with you brother I lost a daughter also not with an illegal but I know how you feel
yes FAKE CRISIS, FAKE PRESIDENT!
no Its evil, what is going on out here. And its getting worse. Mr. President.
yes How dare you use someones sorrow to promote your imaginary emergency. You have nor morals.
yes Rosemarie Cwiertniewicz; last post 10/17. Comments are full of these revived, foreign, & newly created Facebook accounts to show support for propaganda and spread discord.
yes People will come into open doors of your house. Leave your house and open the doors and you will see with open doors people just walk in.
no MaLinda Venatta you lying liar.
yes whats that have to do with an illegal with no license or insurance...etc...if he weren't  here, it never would have happened
yes Bob Cunha name a wall that has worked?  Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR
no Don't pretend you care then support abortion
yes Eff off.  So sick of your treasonous a$$ abusing your powerpower that never should have been placed in your incompetent, tiny hands, with your petty, tiny brain, in the first place.
yes Vote for ALL RED! Stop the killings!  Build that WALL!
yes If we could get every angle family affected in this way to March onto  capital hill
yes Dee Dee Kelly Colvin its sad that there are SO many illegals here
yes Jacqueline Alas laws against murder already on the books and enforced. We are demanding the remainder of our laws are enforced. What is so controversial about that? Why is that so difficult to comprehend.
no Protect your people. Stop the nonsense
yes But the fascist democrats need their human livestock from Central America
no Prayers
yes Sandy Masi
no Stu Brierley Hey brit! Men like this saved your worthless ass in WW2!
yes Amate la vostra Patria perche' se lascerete entrare i Gog e Magog dal Sud America la vostra comicita' si trasforma in dolore. W Mister Trump il Patriota.
no John Burks , better phrased as thats why prisons still have prisoners in them. There are plenty of drugs and weapons in every prison.
no 95% of these comments are bots, lmao.   Have fun the rest of yall.
yes Too many Americans are killed in mass shootings by US Citizens!!!! We need a national emergency to ban guns!! That would be much more effective in saving lives!
yes Because walls work
yes Yes Sir,walls work very well. How effective would a prison be at keeping inmates in without their walls/fences? And walls are absolutely Biblical too.
yes Mark Smart that's not how that works.  A company leased a truck from enterprise, a rental company.  The rental company has no liability of their vehicle in the possession of a subcontractor. Unless it was negligent maintenance that caused the wreck.
yes Hal Eric Mitlitsky you lefties keep regurgitating that mantra about gun control. So stupid, its in the constitution. Also did any of you lunatic leftwings know that Obama already did it 12 times in his Presidency? Btw, we dont give a rats @$$ what  names you whiney sore losers call us. We have names for you too.The dems have to bring in outsiders because the American citizens see they are not for the betterment of this country. Patti Cullen, try telling that to Ms. Pukelosi or the 12 times Obama did it.
yes Alberto Weisz says the foriegn ass piece of dog shit
yes Shame your daughter died. Just glad the wall is getting built
yes Singling out people? What about all the mass shootings in our own country?Americans shooting Americans?Highest in he free world. Gun control? The emergency appears to be your mind?
no Patty Bertocchini La Puma I do care but those stats are not accurate killed is killed not by a human hand
yes Art Gnuvo have you check the new trade agreement with Mexico?  Surely you didnt think Mexico was going to write a check
yes So it is a competition?! One is not as bad as the other?! It matters when some son-of-a-bitch guns you down?! What an asshat! What part of ILLEGAL ALIEN border jumper, who is not supposed to be here to begin with, do you not get?! As in if the illegals were not here at all, they could not kill anyone AT ALL! you mental midget!
yes Painful as it is , this type of situation repeats itself but in different scenarios. But a wall wont solve the presidents ego. Next itll be a some other promise he made to impress the masses holding someone else accountable. Mexico was going to pay for the wall he said . He knew that was a farce . When Irak was invaded , it was because of weapons of mass destruction which were never found to this date . Do not become part of the play because of your loss . Trump is disrespectful of your pain in doing this . Do not let them use you.
yes I pray that the democrats will see the need and help.
no Karen Dearham Grimaldi i just left LA 1 year ago. in 5 years I live in LA, the hispanic popular boomed exponentially. you won't believe it till you actually experienced that. they aren't even scared anymore that they are illegal. they think they are allowed to do that. everywhere in california. they only go into hiding when you call them out, then they will go back when people forget about the problem. right now there are a lot of them at the US border just waiting for us to rest a bit so they will continue. do you even know that hispanic population is now 50% of california? in just less than a decade? how? if not from illegal immigration?
no #MAGA!  #BUILDTHEWALLCRIMEWILLFALL!
no Saschas Page
no Yeah, Angel Precious .  $22tn deficit the highest ever. He really cares about himself!
yes The Congress wastes more in an hour than a wall the entire length of the border with Mexico would cost.   With a multi trillion dollar budget the 6 billion that Trump wants for a wall is a rounding error.
no Tommy Carpenter yea Tommy I know. I was what you might call being sarcastic
no Thank You Mr. President. The only one who truly cares about us.
no He would have liked the idea .
yes But it will be much,much harder.Every country who has a wall say their illegal's have dropped from 50-95% success rate.Israel is at 99%.He is on the front lines we just have news to go by,and some choose to listen and salivate to fake news..And those who believe in God and his word the bible,it's in many a scripture.
yes Nancy Pelosi and Democrats have not negotiated in good faith to fund a wall at our Southern Border, proving that obstruction is far more important to them than YOUR SAFETY.  Last week, more than 95% of the Patriots I polled demanded a wall. Thats because WALLS WORK! I was just in the great city of El Paso, Texas, where illegal traffic has dropped over 90% because of their beautiful wall.  I cannot allow Americas safety and security to be put at risk any longer. We need the wall, and I must put AMERICA FIRST!  Nancy and Democrats have said they will consider filing a legal challenge to ensure the wall is never built, as they continue putting illegal immigrants before Americans. So, we need you to make a HUGE statement to them right now.  Im setting a goal of raising $2,OOO,OOO. I know a goal this big is unprecedented, but we need the American people to make a powerful statement to these Democrats to FINISH THE WALL.  https://donate.donaldjtrump.com/finish-the-wall?amount=42&DCPe=ZGpzYWdlQG1zbi5jb20&utm_medium=email&utm_source=ET_16&utm_campaign=20190217_9282_finish-the-wall_donaldjtrump_tmagac&utm_content=gop_direct-ask_text_contribute_top_42_dn
yes I'm disabled from a stroke from a head on collision with a drunk illegal, there was no shoulder either yet a big ditch I thought he was passing till it was too late he wasn't supposed to pass on a solid line anyways but it happens so that's what I was figuring
no Hmmm. I know that is sad but there are more family members who lost loved ones inmass shootings by white American males.
no To tell the whole truth, the 1.4 million you mention, 98% are from cop self defense, suicide and good Samaritans saving theirs and others lives. Yep, 2% are all that can be called problem killings by criminals. Ask how many gun deaths France and Britain have. It 8lis far higher because only bad guys have guns.   The bottom line is you do not trust your fellow Americans to have the same power as everyone else. U want to disarm us, so you can control us. This is not your fault. Liberals teach this because they are also afraid. I am sorry you have to spend your life cowering in fear. I am sorry you believe Pelosi and Clinton who are protected by armed guards everywhere they go. What's good for them, you do not deserve because u are their subjects.
no This is most definitely why we need a wall. This is a sad story.
yes May God Comfort you.
yes Anthony Clark because flint michigan is a state issue, not a national issue, or a national emergency. Do you understand the meaning of national emergency? Fix your own water issues, hire competent people to run your water plants.
no Thanks you trump for the wall and safety of the American people.
yes Joseph Roy start with Americans first tho. That's where Trump should start
yes Mr. President, thank you for fighting FOR AMERICA!
yes Jack Goldman    Youre an Idiot, Jack.
no Build.the.wall  Make America.safe
no Very good good talk
no Tyler Rogozinski except you neglect consumer and investor confidence with has an immediate effect.  Obama did everything he could to stop any growth and told people straight up "1-2% is the new normal, get use to it."  Trump says "4% is good, let's try for 5 or 6%"
no Dave Callender that's a nice picture of you and your sister.
no Jim Acosta has the gall to  imply/say that the border situation is not a national emergency...........in front of ANGEL MOMS.......this weasel and his fake news pals are colluding with illegal aliens to provide more votes(voter fraud with drivers liscenses that shouldn't be issued to illegals in the first place) for demorats.
yes In 2018 over 37,000 US citizens were killed BY US CITIZENS via gun violence. Why are these deaths less important than the the ones caused by immigrants?
no Great Job Mr. President we've got your back keep up the great work KAG2020 !!!!
no My heart hurts for this family
yes CORRECT  BUILD THE WALL NOW
yes #maga many are getting arrested
yes I dont care what the Left says you, President Trump, you do love our Country and you need to protect us! The Wall is definitely needed! ITS TIME TO BUILD THAT WALL!
no Stay strong!
yes Yes, president trump, ban alcohol too so that nobody dies from alcoholism like your brother fred
no I'm for the wal
yes If walls worked you dipshit, there wouldn't be any drugs, criminals, human trafficking going on. You're just too stupid to understand that. #Conofthedeals
yes Carl Ostendarp art major from yale, oh please tell us lowly working class how to live! Cliche liberal.
no at least the dem side...repub sides on solid ground
no Silvia Serra Lobo uhmmm maybe you should look into what he is saying...
no hahaha Terry Beatus  can't even complete a rational statement
yes Keith Webber Jr.  You are wrong ..you must be in Trump's 35% base
yes Sorry for your loss,build that wall
yes Stay Strong Mr. President. Build the Wall and protect Americans lives and our Country, God Bless.
no Same thing like the girl from Iowa.
no So, so sad.
no Shame on you! For using this tragedy for political purpose! While you ignore the mass shooting in Illinois! 5 died and 5 polices  officers injured! Gun violence is real! Its time to declare a national emergency !
yes Deport and build wall we must defend,Americans first other countries need take care there own
no Not true. 50 people dead so far this year from American citizens shooting each other up. We know what the real emergency is. Most violent crime is not perpetrated by illegal immigrants. Trump just loves to exploit these anecdotal stories when it does happen though.
yes The best president ever!
yes Most crimes are committed by white people, then black people, then other races. Mexicans are not our crime problem but I do agree with securing our borders.
no https://www.facebook.com/367105936678679/photos/a.372249079497698/2040846389304617/?type=3&theater
yes What a crock. Trump said himself he didnt need to call a national emergency he just did it to attempt to sidestep congress.   Illegal immigrants are less likely to kill than native born Americans.  Drugs come in mainly through regular ports of entry. Illegal crossings are at an all time low. But hey who needs facts and rule of law when living in trumps Orwellian universe full of alternative facts.
no Thank you Mr. President! It saddens me that my sons and grandson are not growing up in the same America that I did.  I noticed the most change after Obama.  You are our only hope.  God bless you!
yes BLACK WHITE WHITE WON WHITE HEAT SUN
yes If folks do not think the border problem is a National Emergency, then go tell that to the families of the 70,000 plus that lose family members to drugs each year.  Yes, it is a National Emergency because our people are worth saving from drugs. God Bless You!
no If you threaten or defy American power and might, I encourage you to make your peace with your god and prepare for for your rewards!
yes #FINISHTHATWALL #TRUMP2020
yes Craig J Grove many feel that is just what "they" want ...
no The Government is more dangerous for the American people than anyone crossing the border unfortunately.
yes We need that wall Mr. President'
no Oh you dont care about the American people getting poisoned! But want a wall smh what about the people over here?
no And trump could care less he just wants to use this death to get funding which he will steal for himself to pay hookers to piss on him sad
no I hate the wall and you suck
no If you love America protect them from Russia-Ukraine and all those that come from Russia. And declare your Tax to the Americans you love.
no Chris Wren. Aguilera Samuel can you really ignore this?
yes YES!!!!!!!!!!!!
yes Do you have a security system for your house, lock your doors or call the police when someone enters your home illegally and unwanted with the intent to do something against you? ...I'll wait...
no May GOD be the force that wins this battle.  Have a blessed day with family.  You're entitled to it.  GOD says so.
yes So sorry for your loss it should never happen the loser Democrats will pay one day
yes Just like banning guns wont keep criminals from getting them, a wall won't stop  someone who really wants to from getting in.
no The Greatest President Ever. DONALD J. TRUMP.
yes May God be with you and your wife.  Ill keep your family in my prayers.  God bless
yes How many people need to die before other people care?
yes Keep up good work President Trump
no 13  National Emergency Conditions declared by Hussain Oblama, no suits filed.  1 declared for the illegal invasion of sovereign borders into the USA  by Trump and the Demonrats file a lawsuit and cry, "Unconstitutional!"  These people are the biggest bunch of anti-Americam activists since the Iranians celebrating the attacks against us on 9-11!  Bui.ld The Damn Wall, Democrats!
yes There are too many American killers as well into or out of the country killing people by Townsend and Townsend in wars for example. Dsole. Here also we have assassins of all the countries and own killers as well. What's the example, please, I can't understand the a reason named "why". Please tell me trust. 
yes Skip Rowland El Chapo got caught. Your businesses are over libs. #Build_The_Wall
yes Chuck Martin  Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR
no My sympathies.
no Silvia Serra Lobo He has the facts illegals get benefits right away but Americans are on a waiting list . You get the facts
yes Victoria Kay Riddick Cochran Facebook is not allowing me to see any responses for some reason
yes I need a woman for long team relationship which will lead to marriage
no No mames pinche paisa
yes Thats horrible! She was very beautiful and Im so sorry for your loss.
no White domestic terrorists kill more people than undocumented immigrants. The President should be doing something to solve crises, not create them.
yes Ok ppl are getting paranoid here
no Janet Martin I bet u support mickie mouse too
no Thank God for President Trump!
yes I got no wall around my home and we leave the key  in the door . Weve never had a break-in and there are no guns - Amazingly in Ireland  we have little or no guns and no one carries !  Other then with a few Gangs with illegal Guns - who normally only shoot one another - we dont fear people - or people with GUNS - because there are very seldom seen in #Ireland - no need for WALLS either ????
yes File a law suit against Pelosi and Schumer and take their millions that they have gotten from the cartels.   Unbelievable the demonic-rats!!!
no Shirley Wilson slapdash????
yes I am truly sorry for your loss;however, that does not mean we a wall that costs billions of dollars. We need immigration reforms that are humane and reasonably priced.
no God bless you President Trump
yes A white person killed some ones daughter. What are we going to do about that!
yes And now you just signed an amnesty bill.. great!  How come there never in two years were no figures presented regarding Islamic migration into the US? I t did vastly increase didnt it? While it decreased allot from culturally Christian countries.
yes 10 us code section 284... build the walls
no WATEVER TRUMP ANYTHING TO BRING YOU DOWN
yes Say whatever you want, but what Trump meant was there was no real need for a emergency action. Meaning the Democrats and Republicans could have and should have sorted this out 20,000,000 illegal immigrants ago!
no Mary Langan why?? Do u know there are many tunnels under many border all over the world??
yes Russ Bischoff right on right on right on
no I've been to places where guns are banned. Sure are a lot of people getting shot in those places.
no Dear President Trump....FB  will NOT let me re-post many of my posts....please help me
yes Sofiane Hamouda I got stitches when an illegal immigrant attacked me.  I'd report.  They can come in the right way
no Agree 100% with Eva's statement
no GOVERNMENTS ABOUT TO DROP US ALL IN IT.  Like a juggler trying to keep several objects in the air at the same time - there goes the politicians of the ruling circus that governs this world.  Like clowns hiding behind their public masks - they are but court jesters ruling amidst a menagerie of their own making - as they try to keep so many different people's entertained they are running out of idea's to keep their many different alien patrons happy.  This human zoo from which they have removed the barriers that kept some sort of order - is now becoming a human jungle of wild beasts that are turning more and more on each other as the barriers no longer exist.  All their resources and restraints are being exposed as impotent - as resistance to them is growing by the day - a bunch of circus clowns and jugglers who cannot even keep order among themselves - as they have all been exposed as having their fingers in the till - sleeping with the enemy - and as perverted as is their main stream media mouthpiece acting blameless and preaching like a saint the 'Sermon on the Mount.' on the one hand - when they are all as corrupt as each other.  What's the odds that those clowning circus freaks of power are going to bring the global big top down?
yes Lying POS.
yes  How many more will there be , so sad...the left cant agree... It takes a heartless bunch of Democrats to do what they do well absolutely nothing but care about themselves... guarded ,in their gated fairytale land they live in... what if sumthin like this happen to Pelosi.. AND I dont wish it anyone but its just so sad!!! Get these illegals out .. poor innocent children ,people !!! lost for words ... wake up morons 
yes Americans kill Americans every freakin day. Stupid ass post. I feel bad for the family, but really?
yes Bull crap!  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/nation/2019/02/16/man-kills-five-warehouse-shooting-spree-shortly-after-being-fired-illinois-police-say/Man who kills five in warehouse shooting spree was being fired from his job, Illinois police saywashingtonpost.com
yes Thank you Mr President for working so hard for us America citizens $$/
yes Bob Segal I've listened to trump. I've seen how he works up his base at rallies. . He's inflated statistics to demonize immigrants, refugees, LGBTQ community, minorities and democrats! He has us fighting each other, hating our neighbors . . . . It's what he does.
no Love my president Trump
no Cult of trumpy
yes Sad an all, but doesn't make a valid argument.   Just yesterday 5 people died at the hands of an natural born American citizen. A wall at the border will not stop such things. It'll only waste money that could be better used to help reduce such things....if used correctly.
yes Just build it Im so sick of hearing about it lol nothing will change other than we have a wall
no Sorry for your loss, but white, legal Americans keep killing children and fellow Americans. What's your point?
no Build that wall!!
no The majority living in the area are against it.
yes Yes President keep up the good work youre an amazing man and president!
yes PLEASE...PLEASE...PLEASE....BUILD THE WALL
no It's really necessary
yes And an American killed 5 people and shot 5 police yesterday in Illinois. A wall would not have helped!
no Seriously? What abt all of these deaths? Or are you only concerned abt crimes committed by @certain people or races you dont like? https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/number-of-gun-deaths?page=2&sort=desc&order=State
yes Kelly Anders I'll say it for everyone. Your a fucking idiot.
no Build the wall!! Save our children
no Joseph Nowik, how many more American lives are you willing to sacrifice before it becomes a national emergency in your opinion?
no Listen to him
no We only know what we catch coming in which is a fraction of all the drugs, people & whatnot that slips through Southern border undetected. When 60% of the border is unprotected, finishing the wall is a nobrainer.
no I dont care if you're against the wall. I was against Obamacare and still paid 8 years of fines. Stop your bitching and let's go
no An illegal president killed our country
yes Build the wall ! Trump 2020
no So this situation is made better by allowing illegal dangerous criminals into our country???
no While my heart goes out to you may I say we have many millions who have been killed at the hands of legal citizens,where is the outrage,where is the national emergency for those? We have American citizens that are killers,rapists,drug dealers,human traffickers,gangsters,and such. The only reason these families are even on Trump's radar is because it fits into his narrative.
no I am giving a $100 a month until Border Patrol has everything they need!  My heart breaks for Angel Mom and Dads and the rest of their family and friends!
no Build that Wall
yes Damn right ! The democrats are imbeciles ! They care more about an illegal than your daughter ! Truly Sad ! Trump 2020 !
yes Cal Phillips  soo..... u blaming immigrants for selling ur kid drugs that he bought with his money and his decision hmmm in that care i got 6 friends that are white and sell cocain heroin weed flaka acid xanax  and one of my friends is hispanic and died because of one of them how bout give the land you guys took stingy ass crackers
yes Mr. President Thank God you are working for the American people even though some are not able to see your efforts as what needs to happen.
no Paulo Americo Rocha I can't see the comments private message me
yes If thats your priority try to do something about mass shootings
yes Patti Cullen as apposed to who Obama ? are you mentally handicapped ?  Obama scammed us out of fucking billions .. he gave billions to fucking Iran and then tried to tell us that we somehow owed them half of their entire worth because of some deal the Shaw made with us in the 70s?   .. ueah for half of the entire worth of their country .. for a deal made with a regime that was our friend that we have no obligation to return to a different regime that is one of our number one enemies .. who who who is the con artist ? fucking moron
no #fearmonger
yes Walls work...get over Hillary!
no I need a remedy
no My buddy was killed by a man who turned out to be of Jewish descent. I dunno what I should support...
yes Dems are as dumb as a box of rocks.They wouldn't know an emergency if it hit them in the face. Nothing but a bunch of Satanist .
no Tony Rainwater armed guards at schools seems to be working these days, no law abiding gun owner would ever attack a school let alone children, only the crazy CRIMINALS who obtain guns illegally seem to shoot up schools, might wanna go after them...
yes So no gun control ?
yes Done now your turn!!
no Danny Jones Thank you for the kind thought.  This American really understands your anguish. It seems our culture is also being destroyed. Our President is trying with all his might to stop that from taking place.  I sincerely hope brexit goes though for the UK and that WE get  our border wall.
no Juanita H. Smart  Seriously, thats the 3rd time youve said that.
yes Large walls with armed guards anyway
yes So sorry,hope wall built soon.
yes Let's be clear, this was a car accident. It was vehicular homicide, NOT murder. We still don't know if Joel Velasquez is illegally in the country or not. We don't know if a wall woulda helped or not.
yes Brian Sterling many ifs there jefe
yes If the illegal population voted Republican guess how fast an armed electric fence with a mine field would be built........
no Timothy Kershner good for him  the illegal that murdered my friends child got squat!! Build that wall
no Check out Trump cherry picking stories to suit his political narrative. Your wall will not function Donald J. Trump.
no what was his name?  why havent we heard from these people before
yes Yes. There are a lot of hateful trolls.  Id personally go build that wall especially if it would save lives
yes So sorry for your loss and yes we need to protect our citizens. No one complains about foreign countries laws regarding entering their country. Why do we allow it, anyone can come here just do it legally!!
no My heart breaks for all the Angel Families, so sad
yes Dont you realize, a border is not going to keep the bad outitll only the establish the evil within
yes Wish we had a government in the UK like yours.
no https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NTDMG9V
no Yes, Protect all Americans!! 5 killed yesterday from US citizen. The national emergency is gun control and affordable healthcare!! Not wasting money on a wall, Years in the courts!!
yes That's like saying that because Dahmer killed your kid we need a wall around Milwaukee.
no More American citizens kill Americans than illegals do ! FACT !!
yes Worley Michael, you are an idiot, we need to send fools like you to Mexico and South America with the rest of the ilegals and build our wall to keep you out.
yes https://www.kvia.com/news/border/far-from-migrant-caravans-border-crossings-surge-in-texas/911604294
yes President Donald J. Trump; BUILD THE WALL NO MATTER WHAT!!!  Please protect us, "We The People"!!!!!
no Mark Schwendau youre a lying liar.
no #GREAT PRESIDENT45.
yes An American citizen killed 59 and wounded 500 at a Jason Aldean concert. Don't use these type of stories for reasons to build a wall. There are plenty of more valid ones. But this is making it look like the United States doesn't have murderers of their own. This causes people to hate people that look like me.
yes Why didn't Trump build a wall two years ago when he had a majority in Congress...Because it was not an emergency. Illegal border crossings and apprehensions have been declining for nearly two decades, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and in 2017 were at their lowest point since 1971. A 2018 study published by the Cato Institute found that undocumented immigrants commit less crime than native-born citizens, and according to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) the majority of illegal drugs coming into the country across the southern border are being smuggled through legal points of entry. In other words, this president has manufactured an immigration crisis for his own political gain.
yes After all the national emergencies for other countries from the past president.  About time we use one for our own country!
yes Ahmad Mahmoud and you hide your head in a rag and cover your ugly women with body rags. Get on your camel goat fucker and leave
yes Veronica Sanchez grew up near Detroit....
yes We need one arround Puerto Rico to keep the illegals out
yes I am not picking on Donald J. Trump screw that am sure he wouldn't actually wrestle me because I am a girl but if it were a wrestling match or just romping around like a bunch of kids yea I would bet he would be tough as nails to wrestle. Heck my brothers and sisters and I are all in our 10s, 402, and 30s and we still wrestle just for the fun of it all.  Whippin' up on each other just for fun so yea if he wants to wrestle heck yea I would wrestle with im because heck I love to romp and carry on like a child even though I am 37 years old. its all fun and games.  Heck yea its on.  but only in fun no meanness
no David Woodsmall the difference is their using those events to push for reform that can actually save lives in the future. A border wall is ineffective in preventing these deaths
yes Hmmm...not a single mention of his Type 1 Lia-abetes.
no A legal American citizen killed 5 in Illinois yesterday in yet another mass shooting in Aurora. Get your priorities, straight...fool. that's an emergency.
yes Must monitor for tunnels and should put razor wire at top of wall .
yes Luke Tierney WALL!!
yes WHAT IS THIS WITH THIS WALL AND THE DEMOCRATS AND RINO'S???? I cannot believe we Americans,no matter what side of the aisle would not want the wall unless you are an illegal or have some personal interest in having open borders.  We desperately need immigration reform and we need the wall..  We may not need the whole wall today but we will need it as time progresses.  Last time 15,000 people came to the border.  How many next time or the next time?  And who or what will they be bringing with them?  We have 3000 miles in the southern border that needs protecting.  We need it for our future.  It is always better to be prepared for danger.  Our current Congress is driving me nuts that they have  become so un-american.  I believe in legal immigration, always will.  I just don't believe in illegal immigration in any shape or form in today's world. Try to imagine thousands of people coming into our country illegally every year with no background checks,no job, etc.  Either should our congress.  All American democrats for the wall please start inundating your representatives with phone calls, letters, twitter, e-mail, whatever way you can to show your support for the immigration reform and the wall even if you don't agree with other legislation the president is presenting.  It's important to our future economy, safety, taxes, educational resources for our children.  Keep our taxes here and our country safe.  an ounce of protection is worth a pound of cure.
yes Oh, that makes a big difference then, so the wall will keep democrats out also?  Poor trump followers, bunch of ignorants with stupid arguments
no FACT: Immigrants commit crimes at a lower percentage than American citizens do. Stop spreading propaganda.
yes Without a doubt.....
no SO it's a competition?! I s that  what your point is?! Or are you saying that crime by our own citizens justifies letting illegals border jumpers in?! "Meaningful gun reform?!" Exactly what is that?!  Most of the schools and mass shooters have obtained their weapons LEGALLY, through background checks and "common sense gun controls!" The Florida theatre shooter bought one just for the occasion the day of the shooting! Or then you have those who are criminals like the Aurora shooter of 5 who couldn't get a legal gun so guess what he did, come on Chris, guess what HE DID?! He got one ILLEGALLY!  Not one gun used in a mass shooting in this country was acquired by private sale or transfer either! The UnConstitutional Common sense gun controls we allowed last time with the promise "this will fix the problem" even knowing it would not, have failed miserably and cannot be documented as saving ONE, not ONE American life! You know what has worked, good law abiding citizens who were armed and shot back! You really are a myopic liberal lubricant! #ShallNotBeInfringed!
no They are everywhere driving with no license. They have damaged two of my vehicles that I had to pay to repair. They do not even get cited and are released. I couldn't imagine losing a loved one. It is a huge problem and the cities and churches are conspiring to bring them here. Everyone pays higher insurance rates because of the damage they do. States ignore the fact that one legal person registers 100's of cars for them to drive. The corruption is disgusting. Ohio is overrun with illegals and I am sure most states are. I have few neighbors that speak English in Ohio.
no you want protection or you want TRUMP wall?
no Too many lives lost at the hands of Illegals! From drugs, murders, hit and runs, and drunk driving. BUILD THAT WALL NOW.  DEPORT ILLEGALS.
no Dave Heffner or TDR.
yes Have to stop electing democrates
yes So sorry for your loss.  Thank you for standing up for the victims of illegal aliens and the families of those victims.

yes Finish the Wall, Mr. President!  We are with you!  #WWG1WGA 
yes Thank you for speaking out. Prayers of peace for you and your family.
no HISPANIC CHURCH DIVIDED BY THE COMMIES. GET ALL HISPANICS BEHIND THE RIGHT. NEW MEXICO IS LOSING ITS COUNTRY TO ILLEGALS FROM THE MIDDLE EAST.
no A Republican killed my co-worker. Deport them all.
yes Trump is god for this time Americans people he doing good job in Washington DC
yes COMPLETE A COMPLETE boarder wall !!
yes Forehead thinking
yes Its an incredibly sad day when liberals care more about foreigners than they do about our wives in children. I have no use for them and wish them straight to hell unless they change  their ways
yes 1. Day 758 of 1462 (Illegitimate Presidency) - Embarrassing! The WORLD is laughing at the USA...VP Mike Pence speaking before a Security Conference in Munich was greeted with silence where the crowd was supposed to applaud. He looked visibly shaken after the 2nd time...Again, the WORLD is laughing at the USA b/c of Donald KKK Trump!  https://www.rawstory.com/2019/02/mike-pence-visibly-shook-nobody-claps-applause-lines-disastrous-european-trip/
yes Yes and citizen opened fire on school kids at parkland last year. And shot up a factory two days ago. Your point?
no #FinishTheWall #NoAmnesty #NoDACA #AmericaFirst #Trump2020
yes Walls help as a big part of comprehensive plan.  Walls will never stand alone.  But added to tech and manpower and better enforced laws, walls are one important part of the package.
no An American killed my Compa!!! He was from back east build that wall down the middle of America!!
yes SO AWFUL
yes Ed Wrany not even the best president this afternoon  ...
no My 4 grandparents came to America legally.  Why cant they?  My son died from illegal drugs.  Where did the drugs come from?
no Those opposed, weve lost control over the dangerous people already here, want more? Unlock your doors, take down your walls...
yes President  should look into  3.5 billion that Newsom has breached  contract  for the fast train in ca  he shut down
yes Dave Callender coming from a man who lives in New Hampshire where people don't lock their doors come down to South Texas you'll change your mind
yes Democrats caused the govt shutdown....Democrats are InHumane. They hate Americans and WAWAWA CRYBABIES Personal Vendettas agAinst us True Americans Republicans should be our Congress Office since we have a Republican President...
no Anthony Clark they send billions to other countries, I believe they should do more here but, it does not mean we shouldnt have a wall!
yes And plenty of people have lost loved ones at the hands of US citizens. The wall is your dog whistle to your sycophant supporters. Youre a traitor trump, resign.
no how many legal citizens are murderer?
yes Peter Stock then why do you live in a structure with 4 walls? Remove your walls and welcome them to your home.  If you do this.. I will then support you 100%.
yes What about families killed in shootings by white unstable Americans dont see u doing anything about that
no So proud of you Mr. President! Build it!!!!!!! Keep us safe:)
yes People please, there is no need to justify a barrier leading crossers to ports of entry, it's called rules, even the bad guys aside, it's our country period and we people call the shots, period.
yes Agree!!! I have a list of people to deport and revoke their fake citizenship  have proof they lied on their application
no Duh. Tell us something we don't know.
yes I hope to leave  Egypt  and emigrate  to america ... please mr president  help me about that
no ok mr know it all what would
yes This is the lamest excuse for a wall . Sorry for ur lost but u so wrong - lmao
yes Such stupidity
no The deal can include completely unrelated incentives for the United Kingdom since President Trump said Americans will do the construction and use American steel. It's a win-win. A treaty isn't even needed between friends.
yes Dave Sienknecht nope no way they are coming through the dessert. Really come on, this is a real news report.
no I see illegal immigrants walking working traveling freely in USA,,, it looks like someone is not doing his job !!!
yes Bulls the wall
no Trump 2020!!!!
yes Can I asked how they were an illegal resident?? Did they over stayed their vacation visa like majority of the illegal immigrants? Did they travel over by planes or cross over at the port of entry with a granted visa to only visit and return after their purpose? If so, if they were part of the 62% of illegal immigrants that are here by overstaying past their due dates... how is the wall going to stop others? Now if they were here illegally by hiking through the fields and crossing over outside port of entry, then I support the wall. I just want to know the facts.
yes Steve Finigian you should research before dropping BS.
yes So sad for you
yes Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin WHAT PART OF ILLEGAL MAKES YOU THINK LAW ABIDING  THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE GUY IN THE MILITARY WAS PUNISHED AND YOU COULD GET SOME COMPENSATION FOR YOUR LOSS  BUT YOU ARE TOO BLIND TO SEE THAT  ILLEGAL MEANS ILLEGAL ILLEGAL MEANS AGAINST THE LAW   ONLY LIBERALS THINK ILLEGAL MEANS OBEYING THE LAW
yes Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive its an American society problem. If you really cared about this guy and his daughter you would address that.
no Ron Gagnon  In this great emergency, Trump decided to play golf.
no Do it big man
yes I just don't understand the Democrats and their coldness to these families who have lost loved ones to illegals.   I'm so sorry for all the losses and pray President Trump will get the wall built and our borders protected the way they should be protected.
no Someone needs to go ahead and kill trump instead of shooting schools
yes Most of them are CRIMINALS,  so sorry for your loss!
no Im an airhead because my opinion is different than yours? Ok then.
yes Thank you sir
yes Propaganda ..
yes Bill Reese unfortunate accidents happen all the time. This story is purely about blaming illegal immigrants. And I will still stand with that is petty. Might as well blame the place that made the beer, maker of the truck, whom sold them gas.
yes Carl Mrner we will have guards patrolling the area.  I would like a minefield but I do not see that getting approved.
yes We all need to stand up for our self and our President that stands up for the United States people every day and build that wall.
no Yall lost your minds
yes Oh... so now we are putting Diabetics insulin use ABOVE the LIVES of American Citizens???????  Apples and Oranges people... TWO SEPARATE ISSUES... and definitely an invalid argument.  diabetics have health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid (not to mention thousands of state and private agencies who help when the federal agencies cannot/dont) to cover their insulin costs.  Speaking from a household that has two diabetics, one of them myself!   Hugs  Get the facts straight! 
no Do something about mass shootings, asshole. 
yes I am sorry for your loss
yes Thank you for caring about Mandy Ferguson! Thank you for protecting American citizens!
yes Troll
no Tommy Carpenter I am good....husband died peacefully at home where he had bought and paid for doing what he loved.
no #elongatedskullsofperu
yes Charlesetta Brown there are tons of crimes by illegals that go unreported by media. And, you make the point for us supporters. We have enough home grown criminals to deal with, without opening the border for criminals from other countries. We have far too much crime as it is, and do not need more. So, your argument just worked against you. Thanks for playing, we'll see next week on the wall has begun
yes Timothy Kershner pussy
yes Kimberly Mansfield  get rid of illegals and hey there a whole lot of extra money for mental health
yes Agree build that wall!
yes Kyle Callender from what the CHP officer stated, he came through Texas, thats all they had on the report. No address nothing.
yes Did this illegal immigrant even cross the border by ground or did they over stay their Visa or arrive by air or boat? A wall can only possibly stop one way of arrival, the most least used by illegal immigrants... a wall is stupid.
no Marge Hackett Fox news!
no Immigrants can kill. So can any other human being within the country.
yes GOD BLESS OUR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP
no God Bless President Trump!!
yes ??? And then?
yes So sorry, Sir, for the loss of your daughter. I stand with you in support of the boarder wall. We have the need to feel safe.
yes I'll help build the wall ... Save our jobs . Our benefits & health care .
yes BUILD THE WALL! See what's happening when we let illegals just walk in. We need to start caring for our own country. USA! USA! USA!
yes Eva Graham  You are so ignorant
yes Tudy Anderson Latulip a wall will not stop the illegal handouts and instantly relocate that money to vets. A wall will take decades to build and vets should not have to wait.
no BUILD THAT WALL
yes If that is the case, shouldn't you put a wall around Chicago?
yes Yes,
no Illegal immigrants commit murder so do American citizens. #Donthecon
yes she should not have died and wouldnt have if that Illegal hadnt of been in our Country.
yes That's absolutly bullshit
no STFU Donny
no Nazi's used propaganda like that to condemn the Jews.
no Walls, fence whatever you call it slow people down allowing us to get there and catch them. Also stops drive vehicles from just driving through in places like AZ. Also need the Congress to change laws to stop the flow of people so we can focus on the bad guys.
yes Abdul Majid legal. You do know the difference hopefully
yes Build it TALL
no So sorry! Now senator from Texas John Cornyn is saying hes against Trump getting wall build !! Hes up for election we have too vote him out of office. He is worse then a democrat. Cornyn he is killing America.
no I am so sorry for this man's loss of his daughter @
yes BUILD THE WALL AND BUILD IT TALL
no Carl Ostendarp guns again are not the problem people kill people not guns snowflake
no Agree Mr. President. Im upset that ur party failed us but they're replacable too!
yes And a US citizen shot up Columbine, Shot up Parkland, don't get me started on Eric Robert Rudolph, or Ted Bundy. American Terrorist attack at the 96 Olympics in Atl. Yeah our prisons are filled with Americans. Whats your excuse now? Try again.
yes We really need the wall .
yes Ocasio-Cortez and New York Democrats put poor people out of work. THINK. There would have been thousands of jobs Like cleaning Restaurants Office Construction Democrats putting people into Poverty   Not helping people. Democrats hurt people
no Steve Cotton  Shouldve been armed and protected them,
yes The person who sold him the beer didn't hold a gun to his head and force him to drink too much. The car dealer didn't force him at gunpoint to drive drunk. It's simply called TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS!! No one forced them to kill these people - they did this by themselves. So, before you shoot your mouth off, be sure your brain is loaded!! Call us when you get some common sense. What an idiot. Ain't got the brains God gave an ant!!
yes We Support Our President! Finish the Wall! Trump 2020
no Sheryl Whitfield-Tolliver   love your irony........hahaha  - seriously not a consent comment
no This is to sad how many deaths of American Citizens need to happen and how much money do we need to give illegals before democrats wake up and realize without the wall Americans aren't as safe and are suffering the consequences of the Democratic decisons.. #AmericaFirst #BuildTheWall
yes The statistic shows the number of mass shootings in the United States between 1982 and November 19, 2018, by race and ethnicity of the shooter(s). Between 1982 and November 2018, 60 out of 107 mass shootings were initiated by White shooters. The Las Vegas strip massacre in 2017 had the highest number of victims between 1982 and 2018, with 58 people killed, and over 500 injured. Additional information on mass shooter profiles in the United States  The high number of tragic mass shootings that have occurred in the United States has led to a large amount of attention on the profile of the people who commit such violent acts. A look at the worst mass shootings in the United States suggests no clear common connections other than a tendency to undertake mass shootings in educational institutions and other populated areas. However, a look at mass shootings in the United States by gender shows a great majority of mass shootings are carried out by men.  With no clear patterns between the socio-economic or cultural background of mass shooters increasing attention has been placed on mental health. Analysis of the factors Americans considered to be to blame for mass shootings showed 48 percent of people felt the inability of the mental health system to recognize those who pose a danger to others was a significant factor. Further attention has also been given to the factors influencing the behavior of mass shooters. Surveys on violence in the media and drug use as potential factors show that many Americans place blame on these influences.  In the wake of multiple mass shootings critics have sought to look beyond the issues of shooter identification and their influences by focusing on their access to guns. The study mentioned above showed 61 percent of Americans felt the easy access to firearms was to blame by either a great deal or a fair amount. Hide
no An American murdered 5 people in a bank and another one murdered more today and yesterday too.
no DemocRats don't care, unfortunately.  They LOVE illegals
yes Thank you Mr. President for caring about America while the democrats don't.
yes Should have vetoed that awful spending bill. Big loss for what your base supports
yes THE SKY HAS WALLS AND RIGID IMMIGRATION RULES! WHO HAVE OPEN DOOR POLICIES IS HELL ... I'M WITH THAMP AND I DO NOT GET FOOT !!! ...
no GREAT President Donald J. Trump
yes And a trump supporter killed Mrs Heyer's daughter Heather by mowing her down on the streets of Charlotteville in the middle of trump's "very fine people" rally. https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1zP3gTDEZYk/WjKzpOUXZ7I/AAAAAAAApg0/XvPWfhK6z7se6bZ0TL3I2TApJMo2YqhDACLcBGAs/s1600/171213-teeman-heather-heyer-mom-tease_eb5wff_ie40xu.jpg
no 4000 Americans died last year at the hands of illegal aliens. Thats an average of 5 a week.  When is enough, enough?
yes He flew in from Portugal. He's Portuguese. Build a wall at the airport he flew into.
yes BUILD THAT WALL MR. PRESIDENT! I'm with you on this!
yes No.  Fear mongering is wrong. Smart border security like walls and fencing and technology.  The  majority of illegal immigration and drugs come through ports of entry..
no Amen to that
no ARE YOU ATTEMPTING A MASSACRE??!!!!!!  AND WHO IS SPREADING FALSE RUMORS ABOUT ME AND THE PRESIDENT??!!!!!!  I AM ASKING WHAT HAPPENED AT the address of 2717 South Normandie Avenue in Los Angeles, California 90007 during the 11th hour of February 16th, 2019!!!!  Does it have anything to do with under covered authorities retaliating because they KNOWINGLY REFUSED TO HELP ME WEEKS BEFORE THE FACEBOOK LINK BELOW?!  My comments may be found underneath them.  https://www.facebook.com/NASA/posts/10156928323646772/  https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/717737358622614/
yes Anthony Clark the entire city is run by democrats thats what happens  Also the water crisis ended April of last year
no Are you fucking kidding me right now?
yes I am so sorry for your loss!
no "Walls don't work" is a NON argument. Not supported by facts at all. I can bring fact after fact about walls WORKING. So enough with the manufactured bullshit talking points from the lib media.
yes Joseph Nowik  Juarez mexico is one of the most dangerous cities look it up . Its behind our border and if them walls are not fully secure or they come down thier dangerous city will be part of our country because they can walk over . Think about that ! Think about your family to be safe.
yes https://www.watchdog.org/national/reports-illegal-immigrants-receiving-medicaid-costs-taxpayers-billion-annually/article_6a9860a6-d0bd-11e8-92ed-5bca8b2d3b38.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=user-share
yes Youre disgusting for using the death of someone for political gain
no An illegal killed my son.... build the wall!!!!!!
yes .org/36942///PEBvgJX0hnDHuK9/fcbg/?cat=1&pid=1&i=1163951
no Stacey Britton fear mongering?  You mean like when democrats said if Trump was elected the stock market would crash and possibly never recover?  Or them screaming that Trump would start a nuclear war?  Or that he would take away woman's rights, black rights, gay rights?     All democrats have is fear mongering.
yes Gary Hooper, you have no facts to counter my comments so you resort to name calling.  It's classic for your type!
yes Its a pity, Mr President. America is such a beautiful nation. A decade ago, I went to California to study. I should have fit right in, I spoke perfect English and Spanish, I was paying for my own schooling, and had a bright career ahead of myself being a hardworking person, and a Deans List student in a STEM field. Having gotten out of Venezuela while the getting was good, I felt I was in a land of opportunity and that with hard work, perseverance, and respect there was room for my dreams to come true in this environment. It had not been easy to secure a visa to go to America to study, and staying would not be easy either but my love of the country and its ideals made me determined to try. Life chose a different path for me. Upon finishing college, there was a full-blown economic crisis in the country. I left to Asia where young people like me could more easily find work based on special skills and secure a visa. Others in California suggested I could just stay illegally and eventually use loopholes to claim asylum and go on welfare  but I had too much respect for myself and for the country to do that.   I have spent many years in developed Asia now and I still cannot understand how this situation is still crippling the America I once knew and loved. Over here there is no welfarism, basically no handouts of any kind, and zero tolerance for immigration violations. The result is virtually no crime and very little of thr social ills now a mainstay in every American community: single-parent households, drug addiction, and degeneracy. Over here, there is a vibrant community of highly-skilled and entrepreneurial people from overseas who call cities here home but it not a mass phenomenon. We all have dreams, as do the native citizens here, but we all understand no one has a right to break the law to fulfil their dreams.   Americans, too, have dreams. The establishment politicians and the media have allowed emotional terrorism to dominate the debate on immigration and the rule of law in the United States. Only principles can be used to rein in emotions. I pray for your country everyday and hope the principled will of the American people can win the day in these trying times.
no Joseph Roy Yes we should and we should do something about all the white guys with guns killing all of our women and children too dont you think? Yet we do NOTHING, heck the so called prez never has much to say about any of that does he, only focuses on mexicans day in and day out. So messed up!
no When Trump finish fucking up the economy they will leave anyway!!!
yes We need the wall!!!
no Daniel Alexander Allen Please provide a link to back up that statement or do you just make stuff up as you go along?
yes Who are the legal immigrants who are in jail in the USA???
yes Estefania Torres Restrepo look it up you moron. Look up what the border agents, the chief and mayors have said. I would be embarrassed if my heritage invaded a country where they committed crimes, most couldn't speak English, had no skill, didn't assimilate, didn't care about AMERICA and cost the American Tax Payers 130 billion a year
no TEACHING  THE  RIGHT  WAY !..    https://www.facebook.com/prageru/videos/1878883872216452/
yes Walls wont stop where illegals are the most coming in: Canada, airports, seaports and LEGAL points of entry.  And Trump sure didnt care about that when he hired ILLEGAS for his properties up until just recently WHEN HE GOT CAUGHT.  This just shows Trump cares more about re-election than solving real problems.
no For all those against the wall, look at all the DEMS and liberals that have huge walls and tell me why they have them? Is your door open or do you lock it at night or when you leave the house?!
yes Bob Stubbe the National Emegency guts anything Trump wants gutted in the bill, Trump and his team basically used Obama's precedent to do to
no Linda Durbin
no I notice alot of people who just seem to strangely believe that once a new president come in he snaps his fingers and suddenly everything good that happens his because of him. The first 3 to 3 and half years the current president is riding on the previous one did like how Obama's first years and company unemployment and so on was thanks to goerge Bush goerge Bush was riding Clinton's so he had a surplus in the begening and Bill's didnt start well because of Reagan's deficit. Pay attention for one you can learn alot.
yes yes exactly, the dem abortions. fucking genius response.
no Prayers for you and the wall
no Love my President Trump!
no Build the wall ! Enforce the laws.
no Let's build a big mosque over the white house and invte the Bin Laden family to design and build it
yes Lead by example.....GTFO
yes So sorry too all of you for your unimaginable losses.   BUILD THE WALL MR. PRESIDENT!!!   #buildthewall
no There are legal means in which to come in by.
yes Build the wall !
no Amen.
yes A illegal immigrant killed my friend georgia, he kidnapped her, beat her, raped her and then murdered her and sadly a few other women too before they could find him and take him down.
yes Sean Walsh your comment doesn't deserve it
yes Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
yes You can't hate an entire race for one persons screw up, what if every race that white people did wrong forced you back to where your ancestors came from because trump got one person killed, one person.. You can't live life in anger and hate, it solve nothing and creates chaos... A wall should be built agreed , but hate is not the reason. Passion deprived from a Greek word "pascho" meaning affliction or suffer. "You ask God and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions". James 4:3
no Rich Pal both
yes how does it feel, Charles, to live your life being a disrespectful little punk?
yes Julie Albers Hampe the money was released money that belonged to Iran. Get the facts.
no Keith Webber Jr. you stupid!!! Most of all you are probably on the system..
no Richard Boudreaux they will... first you have to build it and than get paid from Mexico.... its gonna take a little time.... Ill be laughing when Mexico pays for it without knowing about it....
no Aden
yes Wall not fence
yes We are with you Mr. President Trump
no Nancy and Chuck could care less how many are killed as long as they can get the illegal votes and keep the power they wield over the people, they believe in lie, cheat steal and falsely accuse but don't lose power. People should demand that Nancy move out from her fenced security guard home in the rich neighborhood and live in an area with her constituents, the bitch would not last a day. Also should be illegal for her husband to get Government contracts that they make millions on. and to top it off she will retire with over $800,000 per year paid for by the taxpayers of this country.  sorry for the rant, however the people fighting against border security are doing so to line their own pockets.
yes I have seen people driving whom cannot speak or read english and the signs are in English. I've seen them drive 18 wheel trucks and come and ask for directions how to go somewhere. Companies hire illegals.
yes Climate Change?
no Sorry. Mr. President. You shouldnt sign the bill and accepted what the democrats wanted on immigration. U cant trust dems. Now Its going to get worse the southern border problems
yes Yes it is important if its the only way to stop the influx of illegals
yes Yes.  We need the wall.  Thank you Mr. President.
yes wipe your chin...i don't think hes that into you
no What about the thousands of citizens that kill citizens?
yes This is a shame that we have lost any brother or family member! Politicians it will come to you some day more especially you corrupt shits that call yourself our representatives of the people!I call bullshit! When and if it does I do not want to hear one word of grief nor television media about it! Just live with it and move on because the Immigrants are not the problem! YOU POLITICIANS ARE THE WHOLE PROBLEM!  Build the damn wall Trump!
no Jeff Trek
yes https://youtu.be/tlfOPvUABnw
yes Betty Jo Lollis thank you! I only shared so this way people know that MOST if not ALL illegals won't accept the word "NO" I have learned from this experience and I only hope that my story will entice others to break their silence too. It's ok to talk about it. It's a BIG problem amongst other things as well.
yes Sorry for the losses but the wall will help in many ways
yes It's interesting, a handful of illegal immigrants commit crimes, and you ride on those stories for as long as possible. You show sympathy and support for their families and believe something needs to be done immediately to prevent it from happening again.  Meanwhile, over 400 southern baptist employees are found to have sexually abused church members, mainly children....absolute silence. Because those are just the few bad apples right?
no On the contrary, it is a broken tool that would not have done much anyway even when whole; you don;t use broken already inadequate but REALLY expensive tools to address a problem when you have tools that are whole, work well, and cost much less.
no Danny:  Brexit is going to be a disaster, voted on by the same rural rubes who voted in Trump. You are in for a rude awakening when the welfare dries up because of all the lost tax revenue when London loses thousands of high paying fianc jobs.
yes Help Tymoshenko to become the President of Ukraine and we will come and build your wall without a congress.
yes Trump #2020
no Me too I need my wall
no Mark Schwendau Id LOVE to see your credible link regarding this.
no Permanent separation means nothing to baby killing democrats.  How can any democrat consider any of their candidates or voting democrat?  Those freebies buy a lot of votes
yes Let's just forget about all the victims murdered y white people who had guns, I guess.
no Guess what stupid, there was another mass shooting yesterday!!!!
yes Hailey King was my 18 year old cousin. She was left in the street to die by an illegal who hit her and her friend on a Scooter. He was doing over 70 MPH in a 35 zone. After he hit them from behind, throwing Hailey onto his windshield and falling in the street he continued to drag her friend and the Scooter for Blocks until his legs were torn off. Hailey had a Baby girl that will never know her Mommy's voice and her friend is a double amputee.The illegal immigrant that is supposed to be deported at the end of his prison term(originally 17 years) will be out of prison in 2021 (2 yrs for a life and pair of legs), do you want him in your neighborhood? Would you trade places with my family? I stand with my President! Thank you and God Bless you President Donald J. Trump. #ChristianforTrump
no One of the many examples of why we need better border security.  And yet, I always see liberals throwing up people like Dylan Roof and others who a wall wouldnt stop.  They obviously miss the point.  No, a wall wont stop the Dylan Roofs but it will stop the murders by people who never should have been in the country in the first place.
yes So many ears listen to the libtards. You are spot on Deb!
yes Why dont liberals quit crying about the wall and get back to aborting full term babies?
yes OK Stop sending 39 billion dollars to EU!!! I second that for any reason!!! You By Wall!! We Stop Payment to EU,Mexico,Guetamala,ElSalvador,Venezuela,Haiti,Africa,And Everybody!!! Great!!!
yes Glad i live in canada you guys are nuts
yes Amen God bless are President
yes That's one reason we love and respect you, you genuinely care about the american people.   
yes Maximus Herrera i wouldn't try  it the rednecks don't take things lightly and you wouldn't like the ending if you tried ask one.
yes My heart goes out to you
yes Yeah and vote out the people that been running your city for years
yes Matt Martine but criminal's dont care about gun laws they go around them but all these gun laws hurt law abiding people guns dont kill people, people kill people.
no You're the most divisive and disgusting president ever, I support any wall,that leaves your sorry excuse for a soul on the other side of it.
yes Support him in 2020!  Please people dont forget!  Every vote is needed!
yes A Minefield and some Constantine wire might work to
yes So sorry for ur loss.
no Carl Ostendarp Kids wouldnt be here if criminal parents or others sneaking them in STAYED HOME!
yes R. Ryan Roach Duh. They're politicizing this poor woman's death to sell the building of the wall. If he got here by plane or boat, that's horrible, don't you think?
yes Oh pleez, Ted Bundy was a natural born citizen, and we all know how well that turned out.

no Keep ROCKING It Mr.President...best POTUS EVER! Thank you,  thank you, thank you!  Maybe my husband can keep his construction job now...i was well past time for some one to do something! We had been promised solutions by every single administration before you, and they did nothing except steal the money that was supposed to be for a wall? But now YOU are the bad guy...such hypocrisy I've never seen, keep cleaning that swamp Mr.President,  we are behind you 100%...good Americans believe in EVERYTHING you are doing! Also time to make California responsible for disobeying the Commander and Cheif...if they don't do as the POTUS Orders....cut Federal Dollars to them....its time these sanctuary states, who pull their troops out, though you ordered them there...to be held accountable for their actions....no more monry! And move YOUR TROOPS where you order them to be....they have NO CHOICE or say in this issue! This American who's father,  grandfather,  great grandfather's and brothers served this Country honorably,  is appalled at these actions, and every action that has been taken to disrupt,  userp,  disobey our POTUS....Treason is treason..and it's past time to invoke this Mr.President! I'm sorry,  but it just is!!!!
no Put a wall around Illinois, mass shooting, Chicago murder rate.  Put a wall around LA lots of gangs and murder there. Put a wall aroung FLA, NY, Michigan the crime in their large cities deserves to stay behind walls. Come on Trump you are all powerful now declaring national emergencies, over riding your constitution for your own gain. You are soon to be the USAs first Emperor.
yes AMEN.USMC. build the wall mr. Trump we don't want the old legal c r we don't want the human trafficking of young girls we don't want all the drugs in our country that we don't want all the drugs in our country that are walls keep out the cartel 2 the drug cartel
yes You're a lying wonder 45! When you die soon there will be celebrating and feasting. In your adderall loaded mind the homegrown terrorists are very fine people.
yes Thanks for actually working for the American people to secure our country.
no Totally and utterly 100 % backup from Denmark, Scandinavia   The world is getting TIRED of not being able to do anything.
no Eva Graham , Pelosi just keeps on babbling non stop, someone please escort her back to California & tie her to her rocking chair
yes More Americans die at the hands of other Americans via gun violence but the wall is an emergency?
no Chuy Jesus Santy actually , its Asian that's killed the most people , do some reading...that's real
yes "An illegal immigrant..."
no Yes we need the wall bad.
no the Democrats have never had a loved one murdered or rape .if they had they would have already built the wall twice.
yes I dont care Do you?
no Disgusting how an illegal immigrant kills a human being and basically gets off scott free and  a friend of mine who was a homeless vet with mental issues and PTSD attempts to kill a guy in California, victim lives and can't remember what happened and my friend faces life plus 20? Oh yeah forgot my friend isn't an illegal immigrant.
no Ron Gagnon  Democrats had no reason to keep from funding the wall since they voted for it previously in the Obama presidency.
no Build That Wall !!
no Why did my taxes go up $7,000 ya prick? Screw you and your bullshit tax law.
yes John N Karen Morris are you here legally? Prove it
no An illegal immigrant hit my car broadside which put me in the hospital with 4 broken bones, he didn't have a license or any insurance.  We definitely need a wall!
no I dont care how many come over the border I dont want one here taking up jobs give them your job give them your house give them your wife and your kids I dont care
yes So sorry for your loss. Build the Wall
no Hany Kamel QURAN CHAPTER  3 AL- MRAN VERSES 59  The likeness of Jesus in Allah's sight is that of Adam: He created him from dust, then said to him, "Be," and he was.   60  The truth is from your Lord, so do not be of those who doubt.
yes Linda Durbin One angel family does not a crisis make!!!!  Trump declares national emergency...  Nobodys done the job that weve done on the border,  said Donny as he declares a national emergency today........the slowest emergency in history.  And with the lawsuits that will ensue, his wall will not be funded or built until after the next election...if ever.  THE WORLDS SLOWEST EMERGENCY!!!!!  Donny lied directly to Americans about his border crisis.  Our Liar-in-Chief said that all the data that refutes his crisis designation is lies.  Got that?  Our president told the American people that THE FACTS ARE LIES...this is what all wannabe dictators say.  This egomaniac is THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!  Donny doesnt seem terribly concerned about this crisis.  He plans to travel to Florida mere hours after declaring the emergency from the White House. A president, in times of strife, would typically stay in the nations capital to oversee the crisis. Donny plans to do so from the comfort of his weekend getaway.  In reality, Donny is preparing the country for a fake war as he plans to enjoy a mini vacation. The only national emergency in America right now is one of leadership!!
yes Your's along many others, sorry for your loss. Build the wall and make it really high.
no So sorry for your loss...RIP...
no an illegal immigrant killed my brother in law  back in 1968 in his back yard when he had a celebration party for his son's deployement to Vietnam    they hit him in the head with a lead pipe crushing his skul after they were told to leave,

yes #RealNationalEmergency  https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/huppke/ct-met-family-separation-border-children-trump-huppke-20190211-story.html?fbclid=IwAR2yVnMDpq_1q_KufgMFmVW60-QCzUyPO_WiyfcdFWpYR991wILjADYFpLUAmerica, the kidnapper: Likely thousands of children still separatedchicagotribune.com
yes Thru...
yes We need the wall now, not a year after court debates.
no President Trump knows what he's talking about,build the wall you need Mr.President.
yes Trotting out the victims of crimes by immigrants DOES NOT make your case.   You are a pathetic user.   For once in your life, have some class.   MAGA=RESIGN.
no Dave Callender maybe you should have died in that accident then you would have some ground to stand on for your argument like the other family's that have lost family to illegal alien's.  Think man they break the law when coming into our country and break the law after they are here. You go to their country's and break the law. See what happens to you.
yes It really amazes me that there are Millions of people in this country illegally and people don't think that's a problem.
no I cant wait for the Democrats to also use the declaration of emergency to enforce gun control.  Statistically it's more of an emergency.
no Tax all the money that is sent out of the country via remittance.  Just a 40% tax on that money should pay for the wall quite easily.
no Maximus, shouldn't you be out mowing some lawns?
yes 1 year ago. #msdstrong  How many children die from gun violence? Declare THAT emergency.
no God bless you sir sorry for your loss might have been prevented if people had guts and backed trump

no Build the wall for all those precious lives taken by these criminal savages.
yes If we keep giving illegal folks welfare they will keep coming.  Take away the incentives to come the wrong way. Give incentives to those who do it right.
yes Pat Meacham, Trump leads through fear? Have you listened to democrats?
yes How can Anybody put a Price Tag, on Lives that will be Saved with Border Security??
no Build it, build it now!!!!
no #JimAcosta
yes Emil Drr no message received???
yes Firstly, let me start by giving my deepest condolences for losses. Immigrants are people too. So you're saying your pain would be easier to cope with had your loved ones been killed by an american? Make me understand the logic here.
no I am all for trump trust me! But signing the bill we got raped
yes Please let me be your friend
yes and what about all the mass shootings in America?  American's killing Americans.  How will you get a handle on that?
yes Remember that this pretty girl is AMERICAN just like you. Why isn't it the other way around, an illegal was killed by a pretty young American girl. You will never hear that.
yes Symone Nelson-McKnight read the comments
yes Schumer and Pelosi and the Democrat party in Congress ARE an enemy to the Country.....
yes Because that has worked so far?  They do nothing! Let's declare some more sanctuary cities!  Oh, and forget about the children trafficked through that border each year
yes Lynn Limauro Floyd How sad!!!! Yes,  BUILD THE WALL!  YOUR SON'S DEATH SHOULD NOT BE IN VAIN!  WRITE PELOSI AND SHUMER! WRITE MANY LETTERS! GO TO THE PRESS!!!!

yes When can I play golf with you?  I'll pay my own travel expenses.
yes Thank you president Trump
yes Alepo Serrot God doesn't bless idiots
yes For every American killed by an illegal alien a Democrats family should pay the price. It's all about bringing it home to these untouchables and balance.
yes Every day illegals are arrested in Atlanta for stealing, selling drugs or I think you knew I meant meth, I guess I am not perfect. Suffered stroke and brain and fingers aret together working.
yes Do you Demtards even know what the word precedent even means???
no Hussein Obam needs to explain his Whabbist /Zionist agenda. Get 9/11 reinvestigated now and expose Hillary's ties to Huma whom she wanted to grant more power after her election. Thank goodness she lost.
no i just dont understand how people dont support the wall. we have walls everywhere. weve been using them to keep INTRUDERS out for damn near forever. do you not use walls to keep your home safe? do you not lock your door to keep intruders from entering ILLEGALLY?? why is this such a hard concept for yall to grasp? it makes perfect sense.
no YES BUILDBTHE WALL
no Trump has no shame.
no The criminal trumpleforeskin is going to prison.
no Can't wait for future presidents to call national emergencies on healthcare, global warming, and gun violence.  Thank you for your overreach and creating this  new process of bypassing Congress.
yes Just as i thought. You lil fkers dont care about americans.
yes Brett Gibson Brett Gibson And they're darkies!! 1

yes Even one Angel mom is too many
no Blessings to you Mr president
no Dale Montri
yes Tomek Jasinski built that wall!!!
yes Estefania Torres Restrepo California  LARGEST INSANE ASYLUM IN THE WORLD  Interesting that the LA Times did this. All the others are staying away from it. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, this should be of great interest to you!  Just One State - be sure and read the last part...  try for 3 times.  This is only one State... If this doesn't open your eyes, nothing will!  From the LA. Times:  1. 40% of all workers in LA County (10.2 million people) are working for cash; and not paying taxes. This is because they are predominantly illegal immigrants, working without a green card. (Donald Trump was right)  2. 95 %of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens.  3. 75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens.  4. Over 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers.  5. Nearly 35% of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals; they are here illegally.  6. Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages.  7. The FBI reports half of all gang members in Los Angeles are most likely illegal aliens from south of the border.  8 Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal.  9. 21 radio stations in LA are Spanish-speaking.  10. In LA County, 5.1 million people speak English; 3.9 million, speak Spanish. (There are 10.2 million people, in LA County.  (All 10 of the above facts were published in the Los Angeles Times)  Less than 2% of illegal aliens are picking our crops, but 29% are on welfare.  Over 70% of the United States' annual population growth, ( and over 90% of California, Florida, and New York), results from immigration.  Also, 29% of inmates in federal prisons are illegal aliens.  We are fools for letting this continue.  HOW CAN YOU HELP?  Send copies of this letter, to at least two other people.  To 100, would be even better.
yes Thank you President Trump for all your hard work to keep us safe...
yes Same way your ancestors did
yes Worley Michael Lol shut up your kind don't know what fascism is...hint: It's not when your side loses an election and decides to engage in a corrupt witch hunt against a duly elected PoTUS.  Is that why it's been revealed they have NOTHING to link Trump to Russia? Mueller is a threat to our Republic and needs ousted.
yes You should not have signed that bill. I hope you have a plan... because that bill does everything they want. It reduces ICE funding and limits their operations. Why did you sign that????
no Build the wall! So many jobs and money wasted on illegals.
yes If gates and walls dont work,why do people live in gated communities?
no Your highest priority is yourself...  your meme failed...
yes Philip Mueller, why dont walls work? If they dont work, why do we see so many all over America?
yes Some activist judge is supposed to tell The president of the United States what an emergency is. Where is the worthless supreme court to take this matter up directly.  Considering the fact that you have four activist liberal hand puppets on the Supreme Court for the leftist, and Roberts, I see a real constitutional crisis. Supreme court should just state that the Court does not have jurisdiction in this separation of powers issue.
no And Trump understands and cares for you. lol. Ask a farmer how much he cares.
yes Adam Jasso we should be celebrating
no TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP 2020
no You must resign immediately, Mr Trump.
yes Yeah and a dingo took your baby.
yes Round them up and deport them.
yes Gus Keller I'm sure you have. You've probably seen "mfers," step over invisible lines too. I'd guess would be easier, quicker, and a place of choice (unless you're are a Parkour practitioner)  vs. a place with wall. Similar with the "dig a hole" argument.
no Trump's the anti Christ just so y'all Kno we living in revelation an the end is near.. I suggest u all get right with ur maker oh yeah an trump
no coming over the border illegally at the rate of 60,000 a month...and not "mexicans" but all illegals, drugs, human traffickers ...it's a very big concern. are you saying we don't have laws and are not enforcing them for your concerns? or programs in place for those in need?
yes MJ  Stark what color is the dress?
yes Lord have mercy Irene Roberts! Yoi better open your mind. My question was not what is it. He has lied to you and told you that he has started. Nope. Where did the money come from ? Where is it? When did he start? He Is Lying To You. Point blank period. Of it is the truth you should be able to answer the what when and where. Believe in the truth. Sorry that is all I'm telling you. I don't care if you believe me.
no George E Simpkins Jr Why did he wait?... i live in the borderlands... I know what's going on here. He should have moved sooner! I'd put the Marines on the border! 2 yrs...
yes Having illegal immigrants in our country has gone long enough. Weve lost a lot of good Americans because these dirty/filthy illegal immigrants that wants to damned this great nation of freedom, but well not go down without a FIGHT!
no Complete the Wall!!!
no So very sorry
yes Geez--of course sympathy to him and I am sorry to see drumf use you for a photo-op
yes The press and media serve as a check and balance on power which is an underlying principle to our freedom. Power tends to corrupt and absolute power tends to corrupt absolutely. We need a check and balance on executive power.
no Its several times a dsy
no BUILD YOUR WALL BACK IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY BERLIN!
yes Dawn Duff what is pointless is spending over 100 billion dollars a year of taxpayer money on people that have no legal right to be here.  Why aren't you crying about sending billions of OUR tax dollars to Jordan to build THEIR pointless wall?
no Robert Dahlquist  like the emergency we are experiencing, check this out...I didnt really need to type it out but I wanna do it fast.
yes Then why did your new tax plan rob the most from the middle and lower class?
no MISTER PRESIDENT
yes TO THE 90 AS$HOLES THAT PUT THE LAUGH EMOJI. KARMA IS A BITCH.
no linda you triggered TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME  VICTIMS
yes national emergency your a joke to the world
yes Are the parents of school shooting victims considered Angel Families too? Or doesn't domestic terrorism count. 17,200 murders by American citizens last year. 1,886 murders by illegals.
yes What an idiot worry about ur bitch cheating on you lmoaf
yes Um, he wasnt even supposed to be in America in the first place?
yes ...more murder committed by our own legal citizens.  Facts first.
no Trump for 2020
yes Joe Hernandez
no Thank you Mr. President! Youre doing the right thing! America has your back.
yes Elena Pate   You state stay strong and the UK will prosper.  Interesting comment Elana - clearly you know something about international trade and economics that has eluded everyone else. Care to share? How will the U.K. prosper outside of the worlds largest trading bloc?   Im really interested in your reply.  The EU is the world's biggest exporter of manufactured goods and services, and it is the biggest import market for over 100 countries. It is also the world's largest single market area
yes Will you please pardon Mr. Gallagher,  Mr.President?  https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2315525691831830&id=100001232648389
yes For everyone who has lost a loved one needlessly, build the wall! Democrats, protect your loved ones! Elect people who support a wall!
yes i said this once-twice before, shoild be publicized WHY we basically do not hear much about thois crap onnour northern borders.  i know some reasons why, maybe a klist at of top reasons wouldenlighten some people that our so border does not have to be this way.  
yes Brandon Joseph Long  Mass shootings are minuscule compared to other murders and homicides done by illegals
no Hey zippy, we don't need to import more criminals we have enough of our own !
yes So sorry for everyones losses ...We so need that wall Mr Trump...
yes Why don't we protect our vulnerable citizens from being harmed? https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2019/01/28/arizona-law-gave-preference-hacienda-healthcare/2574597002/
no Hey president Idiot,  we have 60, 000 gun violence per year. Your own people are running around with red caps shooting up schools and sending bombs.  WHERE ARE YOUR EMERGENCY FOR THEM? . . https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/ann-coulter-hits-back-trump-231420266.html
no USA Today is fake news as you stated in the past.
no But according to the Democratic party it's ok till it happens to one of their family
yes https://www.kob.com/investigative-news/large-groups-of-migrants-continue-to-illegally-cross-border-into-nms-bootheel/5245796/?cat=12387-for you Patrick P. Huneault-NBC4 albuquerque. I lived there for 40 years. Build the wall.
no I believe better funding and more modern boarder patrol will help. A wall   is fiscally irresponsible
yes Yes we need it
no Kathy Smith Williams It's a joke asshole, there I can spell that huh genius!
no El Chapo's people  are Expert mine diggers
no https://youtu.be/06BE9SiWEwA
yes Times are changing! The Wall with State if the Art Technologies will really help!
no Build
yes Thank you for fighting for Americans!  We appreciate you so much
no Maureen Hersey Brown I can't believe the lack of compassion and empathy by these liberals.  They say, "who cares?!"  Wow!  And, the other lame garbage they put up is so mental.
no Donna Davis Nice picture. I could have mistaken it for Kermit Gosnell's abortion clinic.
no Please Build that Wall!!!!
no Where was the illegal murderer from?  What country?  You know we grow our own criminals in this country.  Were any of the kids killed inn school shootings?  I believe all of the shooters were born and raised in the United States.
yes Build that wall. MAGA
yes Another shooting in America. The shooter is a legal american : https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47261314
no Simon Kitson Simon says...stupid things...
yes The McDonalds in Costa Mesa has to have an armed guard now!!
yes Prison walls will keep us safe from you.
yes The wall is being built thanks to our President Donald J. Trump.
no Democrats want open unsecured borders.  They also want no voter ID.  Democrats also know 8 in 10 legal and illegal immigrants vote for Democrats.   Democrats realized this affect in California elections...and now control that state.  Democrats cannot be trusted, criminal intent.
yes Strong, effective border is absolutely necessary if we want to prosper. End exist as a nation.
yes Illegal aliens people they are not  immigrants.
no Charlesetta Brown CNN/Money stated that Obama oversaw the worst recovery in the history of the US.  Only president to never see 3%+ annual GDP and that was with the Fed keeping interest rates at 0% for almost all of Obama's 8 years.
no Diane Smith I know alot of people that  were democrats that are going to vote for our POTUS,because they have seen how the democrats have lost their minds. I was a Democrat up untill Obama got elected. I'm so glad I'm for a party now that has common sense instead of stupidity,love for our country instead of trying to destroy it.
no Bill Rahbine no need for hunting , they quick w/ dah shits .  they will kidnap you & torture you .
yes You my not care about this until it hits home.
yes If a president can go golfing hours after declaring a National Emergency, it's not a National Emergency.
yes Diane Edwards Linton how many suicides are committed with a gun? Sure. Take away the guns. And then you end up committing suicide like my childhood best friend did when we were in 8th grade. Hung himself by the road for everyone to see. Gee..maybe we should ban rope too?
yes Shame you dont mean that...there will be nothing left if you dont protect what we need..https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2019/2/15/1834958/-Federal-judge-dismisses-butterfly-sanctuary-s-restraining-order-Trump-s-bulldozers-roll-on
yes Has Mexico changed their name to Democrat's? Then yeah Mexico is apparently playing haha
yes Estefania Torres Restrepo political gain how about safety....using the deaths to show a secure border is necessary!!!
no Enjoy the omelette bar during this national emergency.
yes you should have been more up to date on current affairs then and you would know why...smh
yes Fact: No Republican has EVER had an abortion.
yes Serious question: How is a wall going to prevent DWIs or reduce the immigrants who legally came to The U.S. but illegally stayed? The only wall that exists to any magnitude is a landmark, not protection of any kind, as it was thousands of years ago. Weve made boats and planes since then.
no Sorry, an illegal immigrant. Otherwise, the entire situation is the same.
yes Trump I appreciate your efforts and you are not pts"DISORDERED" for being reputationally assaulted! It's pts INJURY CAUSED BY TERRORISTS AND JUSTICE CURES IT
yes I think people are so caught up with being against building the wall that the whole idea here is being lost. Replace those words with enhancing security and see how you feel then. If someone broke in to the school your child attends youll be the first people saying How could that ever happen? Where was security? We pay all these tax dollars for what, so our child could be at risk where they should be safe? Or youre at a mall and someone bursts in and starts open fire. Youd be the first people demanding better enhanced security.  This wall is being built for SECURITY to keep the majority of the illegals out. If you are from a foreign nation and want to come here do it the right way. Get proper documentation, medical clearance, working papers, etc. Nothing good is coming out of illegals sneaking across the borders. Lets spend the money to enhance security (wall)  now so that money can then be spent to help the homeless, sick veterans, people who cant afford health coverage, etc, etc, etc who are American citizens instead of continuously paying for illegals who quite frankly, do not deserve to be here.  Has anyone heard of the quote You can pay now or pay later?  Well, Im sick of paying later. It hasnt done us any good. Solve the problem now so we can take care of our own problems on our own soil for American citizens sooner. #MAGA
yes What about the people killed my homegrown terrorists in America. There's more murders committed by them
yes Stop killing innocent people in Indian occupied Kashmir , shame on Indian army
yes Iain McGuire if your referring to Churchill thats obvious I was referring to a man like him smart ass
yes Maureen Hersey Brown  You are a moron if you believe that
no trump doesn't give a rats ass about anybody but himself. What we know for fact is he is; a criminal, thief, serial adulterer, sexual assailant. He may also be a treasonous traitor.  https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/cummings-says-new-evidence-shows-trump-attorneys-may-have-misled-n972341?cid=sm_npd_nn_fb_ma
yes Build the wall and protect it with lethal force just like the Berlin Wall was
yes nothing trump says is right.
yes You are all ignorant stupid humans .really so dumb the reading some of these post is so embarrassing.
yes How did they get into the country?
yes BUILD THE WALL !
yes Donald j trump is the least intelligent person
no You guys raped the Mexicans along time ago REMEMBER
yes Tudy Anderson Latulip true. And on 9/11 Congress agreed with President Bush because that was a real national emergency.
yes Sunny M Oko here some do too.
yes Yes, we know that illegal immigrants killed a lot of people in America and Canada but one of them was DONALD TRUMP grandfather who lived in America and Canada illegally and had illegal business where when he left to GERMANY he was refused his Germany citizenship and one more thing is Donald Trump used illegal immigrants to work for him because he couldn't afford to pay American workers now this is the guy lying to you? you just have to believe him, if you guys can promise him that you can vote for him even without building a wall and tell him to stop Emergency or shutting down the government may be he can because what he really wants is to be re-elected as United States president not United shshshshshshs of america.
yes I hate your a$$!
yes You are a ConMan
yes Pls don't involve yourself in topics you don't understand.
yes Christopher John I got it! Some don't get humor Christopher?
no Americans must donate funds like we Pakistanies Donating funds for Dams in Pakistan. Best of luck.
no Apple Rivera Im sorry this happened to you but someones legal status doesnt make a lick of difference when it comes to their character. This couldve easily been an American citizen. Im sure there are thousands of stories like yours that involved people who have legal status.
yes Edward Lavelle
yes we need to hold politicians accountable. Treason,  aiding in illegal activity
no Yes,  I agree Border Control & Gun Control, 2 very important issues!  Let's work together on this to save American Lives!
yes Tom Barker no that was Obama. Check your mental health status asap.
yes So very sorry for the loss of your lovely daughter. Thank you for supporting President Trump.
no We finally have a president that cares above the people in this world should've been put up long ago we would not have had so much crime
yes Dear President Trump, thank you!  For many years, we were lied to.  We never questioned our Government, we always believed that what they were doing was the right thing for the American people, when in-fact it wasn't.  I, myself was blinded by their lies and the media help hide those lies.  I never knew how much evil and hate was hidden in this world until you became President. It's a shame how people act, let alone can't see for themselves that we were, have and are being brainwashed to spill out this hate, and it's even more heart breaking that they can't see how the Democrats and certain Republicans can't be honest.  Their main goal is to one day take our rights away. It's even more heart breaking and sick when people agree to kill an innocent child.     Looking back over the years, I noticed that when someone is finally wanting to do good for the American people, they question you, they tear you down, they call you names, they call you a liar, etc., but when evil and lies exist, we say nothing. Insane!!!  Anyway, thank you for opening my eyes to the truth, thank you for being you, thank you for giving up so much when you didn't have to, thank you for standing strong, thanking you for all that you do.  My prayers are always with you and your family, President Trump.    
no The Gov Kills Millions of Americans a day
no Hi
yes This is tragic and I pray for the father & his family.  Spreading hate and fear that all illegal immigrants are dangerous is also disgusting though...
yes Yes Build the Wall !!
yes I wonder why all the border security experts say a wall won't do much....hmmm...
no The more people that speak out the better especially the people that live close to the border and see what is happening.
yes I don't pay much attention to Numbers.....I talk to People and Look at the way people are Living.....
yes Why do they have fiveheads?
yes Marcus Rech MS13 is an AMERICAN gang, fyi.
yes Pearl Brown Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR
yes What about people who was saved by illegal immigrants. If you decided build the wall believing that you will be safe after this. You are wrong. Yes you have to do something with illegal immigrants but not with this way. Way with hating them. Sorry for my English. And I'm not illegal immigrant
no Juanita Craner
yes Alex Dahlen source it yourself... look at the shared expensives of the EU
no Helped with China for 500 years.
yes Just hope after the wall is built, illegals that already here dont start killing people to make everybody think trump was wrong!
no Ess Emm DeeVee no need to be disrespectful I asked a simple question.
no And you just had installed a USD50K golf simulator in the WH!! You are a stock of laugh
yes Convince  the  RETARDED  far  left.  They  dont  seem  to  care  either  way!
no Lots of white people kill people in America . What does that prove!!!!!!
yes 140 Democrats last week voted against a resolution in Congress condemning the act of allowing illegals to vote in our elections.. While they've been screaming foreign interference, they've been the ones to admit it. They found nearly 2 million non citizens on the California voting registry. That's right, they are indeed, after saying they weren't, allowing illegals and non citizens to vote. That should be Trump's next EO. The only thing Cali agreed to do, was to remove the 153,000 dead voters on their roll, but they insist on leaving illegals, and non citizens registered. I don't know how this hasn't already been stopped, but the entire party, other than maybe Munchin, should be arrested, and brought up on  high treason charges
yes A US police officer killed my ex, we should build the wall so Americans like him cant get out and ruin other countries lives.
yes Peter Richards omg....please tell me you were being sarcastic....33% is 1/3. 31% is pretty freaking close...no one could be that stupid...right??
yes Absoutely correct.
yes Walls don't work if we still let them in, provide money, an education to their children in their language, free health care, citizenship to babies born here and finally the right to vote
yes YES !
no What about white citizens in South Africa.. stuff here is getting outta hand with all the farm murders.. it's being kept away from the news etc.. please, is there a way for amnesty.. I've worked on Carnival Cruise lines for almost a decade and would love to live in the US.. People are so kind over there
yes I'm just wondering.....do people live under rocks? How do you not see the damage illegal immigrants do?
yes How will you protect us from the thousands of American criminals already inside??
no yes sir finish that great big beautiful wall of securiy,safety and protection of our AMERICAN people .
yes The fact you politicize the death of someones child for your own agenda shows how disgusting you truly are.  This wall is about securing the far right votes for 2020.  You confirmed it when you said I didnt have to do this as in declaring a National Emergency, Con!
yes I support our president, Donald Trump!
yes Bull O'Neill HHS officials acknowledged that federal officials lost track of almost 1,500 migrant children in 2017 after they were placed with adult sponsors.
no What about all the school shootings by Americans? Those just dont matter? One problem by an illegal immigrant and thats your excuse?? A lot of worse things happen and theyre not caused by the people youre blaming. Youre doing more damage to the country. Money doesnt make you any smarter..
yes Carol Flores and over 2/3rds of those are related to mental health. The statistics account for self harm and suicides as well. The vast majority of the rest are gang or street violence by people who are illegally in possession of the arms.   Depression kills more than violence and alcohol or tabacco kills more than both.  Opioids too...
yes Danny Jones 30 years ago I visited your country I was expecting to see a quaint London  instead was barraged by Muslims who surrounded my table as soon as I pulled out my American passport to show a French girl who wanted to see it. At that point I had to pretend I was Mexican and spoke all Spanish. This was 30 YEARS ago. I can't imagine what it's like now.
yes 100 million dollars worth of water bottles instead of actually fixing the damn pipes. FLINT NEEDS CLEAN WATER.  but you dont care
yes But real national emergency is gun fires. Are you safe? No.
no Does this mean that when a man from la kills a man in Arizona, la will be walled off to to stop murderers? Wonder how America will look in ten years if that becomes the trend.
yes Shayna Franzetti
yes Our Country needs to stop listening to Democrats that lie to keep the border open. Their deceit has created the problems we face today.
yes THANL YOU SO MUCH FOR PUTTING US FIRST .YOU ARE MY .HERO, GOD IS GOING TO BLESS YOU.
no First of all, I have sympathy for these people trying to find a better life but the US cannot continue to take care of these people.  It is costing us billions of dollars monthly now.  Can you imagine the cost if we allow droves of them to come as these caravans from central America are coming?  Once you let some in, nearly all from those countries will be here.  We have our own needy to take care of and doing a somewhat shabby job of that.                                  How many are you willing to sponsor, Art?
no Yes he is My President....and I love him
no very sad
no Well Mr. President,  your new tax reform fu*** middle class income such myself. Please reconsider if you want the middle class votes next election.
yes This was a jarring week as Trump declared a national emergency after Congress refused to fund his wall  perhaps his most brazen authoritarian act yet. Trumps predilection not to govern, but rather rule by an unprecedented executive fiat, set off alarm bells for Constitutional separation of powers, as Trump departed early Friday for a weekend of golf at Mar-a-Lago.  This week the Mueller probe made news as reporting indicated Trumps former campaign chair Paul Manafort discussed a peace plan for Ukraine and handed off internal polling data in a secretive meeting to a business associate with ties to Russian intelligence, and a search warrant revealed Roger Stone was in direct contact with WikiLeaks while interacting with the Trump campaign  both in the months before the 2016 election.  At a Trump campaign-style event in El Paso, a BBC cameraman was physically assaulted by a supporter  symbolic of Trumps continued attacks on the media and his stoking of hatred against marginalized communities. Trumps speech in El Paso and his declaring a manufactured emergency in Rose Garden were both a repetition of disproven lies and exaggerations, as Trump continues to propagate a dystopian alternate reality and act unilaterally.

yes at least trump delivers
no How can Democrats live with themselves -0let alone view the photos of reality
yes The Secure Fence Act of 2006 (Pub.L. 109367), also labelled H.R. 6061, is an Act of the United States Congress which authorized and partially funded the construction of 700 miles (1,125 km) of physical fence/barriers along the Mexican border. It was signed into law on October 26, 2006, by U.S. President George W. Bush, stating "This bill will help protect the American people. This bill will make our borders more secure. It is an important step toward immigration reform."[1] Bill H.R. 6061 was introduced in the House of Representatives on September 13, 2006, by Congressman Peter T. King, Republican of New York, passing 283138 on September 14, 2006.[2] It passed the Senate 8019 on September 29, 2006
no You  are  have my  condolences.  The  government  have
yes I support the wall. Build it. Trump 2020 %
yes Yes, we must!!
yes Pretty girl
no And we all need to start carrying guns to protect ourselves and our families.
no I don't understand why President Trump did not declare this an emergency two years ago when he could have done more and got more money without a fight? Now it will be the Democrats fault and his base will fall in line with that  like mindless sheep
no I have 3 daughters and can't imagine the pain of losing a child. I'm so sorry for the loss of your child, your beautiful daughter. My grandmother and grandfather both came to this country legally. I support Trump and I support the wall. We welcome anyone, just do it the right way, the legal way. I don't understand why people have such a hard time with that.
no Apple Rivera bullsh!t stupid bot.
no Romain lettuce killed 25 people last year!  Lets ban Romain lettuce!
yes Weak boarders, equally weak Country.  Make America great again.  Great and strong. Amen.
yes Yes then vote all Democrats up president Trump needs to throw out swalwell hes  threatening to nuke Americans for not giving up our constitution deal.with this now Americans vote out Democrats
yes Joseph Nowik TRUMP 2020. Sad our representatives don't care about America.
no So sad. We need the wall
no Walls work  USA USA Trump 2020
no Ina Maitland no the wall is not wrong . We have children dying every few minutes from drugs brought in why cant you people open your eyes. Most people have wall and fences around there home for safety . What in the,world are you people thinkg. Maybe you just dont care about these kids and people getting hold of these drugs and the violence from it. .
yes Wait til Melania Trump says she was sexually abused by Donald Trump and his SUPPORTERS will chant lock her up...lock her up... And his Crowd is Cheering him on!!!!
no Keep doin what you are doing mr President..... I stand with you
yes Because a person willing to kill people is going to look at a wall and say oops, look at that ... getting past this would be illegal, I should stop here.
yes Declares a national emergency, also states it isnt an emergency, I didnt need to do this, but Id rather do it much faster.  And goes to Mar-largo  Im confused.   What is the emergency?  And how is your administration responding to it? By golfing?
no Impeach the liberal traitors then arrest them and put them behind bars.
no Pamela Parker well said a totally agree !!
no Faye Cbsbl Tucker amen!
no Agree, 
yes You're wife is a mail order bride you clown
yes What most of Trumps supporters need to understand is that illegal immigrants commit less than 1% of violent crimes in this country. 4 studies have been written, including one by the conservative Cato Institute, that all show this. These crimes that are committed could have just as easily been committed by US citizens.
yes Emily Neal, so you are obviously for alcohol to be completely banned, because tens of thousands Americans have been killed by people that should have not had alcohol in the first place.  Correct?
yes And an american killed my father....soooooo
yes How come we can give Israel money to the tune of around $3 Billion annually and they are using some of that money to build walls and none of our politicians complain about how they're "wasting money on walls" in Israel?? The U.S. is partially funding those walls along with the Iron Dome anti-missile system! Yet not one word about the walls in Israel from Schumer or Pelosi!!!! They are 2 hypocrites! We also gave some money to Jordan and Saudi Arabia! We give money to everyone!!!!! Enough! Secure our border!
yes Get um all out!
yes TRUMP 2020.
yes You want reroute wall money to help US citizens? How about we reroute the billions we give illegals instead. How about the billions sent abroad to our so called allies?  Im pretty sure there are tons of dollars wasted on non citizens every day. Why take away our shot at securing the border?
yes Ignoring the law is corrupt. Corruption is what really destroys countries. Places with low levels of corruption have a good standard of living.
yes Do we our money eith our family .Do far our kids social security  benefit has used during Obama era for eight years  .we get any thing .
yes Things will change when someone in the Democratic party (or someone close to them).. goes through this personally .. it may even take several incidences such as this to hit close to home .. But, eventually it will happen.
yes Alyssa Taylor he was drunk. But like I said this was a drunk idiot problem, and has nothing to do with Mexicans. Wheres all this outrage when a drunk Russian or Ukrainian who overstayed their visa hits and kills a person? Why are only Mexicans used in this way?? For political brownie points.
no I am sure Pelosi and Schumer won't send any sympathy flower!
no #BUILDTHEWALL!
no Walls don't work, they can be dug under, climbed over, even drones flown over. This is not auswitz
yes Deb Shriver, How did those illegals guilty of those crimes get into the United States?  We're waiting
no Shame... it very sad to see how low can the president goes.
yes Adam Somerville
yes Danny Jones yeah thats the Democrat love for you We deal with every day killing everything here in the United States
yes Nice generalization
yes Go golf
no Your family members are more likely to be killed by US citizens. So then should we create walls to box every person in?  Risks need to be looked at rationally.
yes Jeff you need to put down the bottle of Muscato
yes It is estimated that American residents kill more to immigrants.Seems you are eying Elchapos funds to build the fence hence surplus to fund your bankruptcies.
yes Can I donate my tax return to the wall?
yes You are a disgrace to the human species.
no I've been saying the same thing except I'm saying trade the Democraps for the illegals and we would all be better off. After all the illegals are fleeing mostly socialist countries
yes President Trump, you should start a campaign to your supporters to donate money to build the wall.  We voted you in and support you.  I believe you have enough supporters that would donate and let us build the wall!
yes Why is yall supporting something tgats trap us all in in.
yes ... and walls cut off the vote recruitment stream.
no In Trump I trust
yes Oh, drunk driving.
no Why Adrian Vargas
yes Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher... just saying
yes Liberals care more for illegal invaders and criminals than Americans.  Thank GOD for President Trump!  MAGA
no A post that didn't get laugh reacts. Good.
yes Yes! Build the wall!
yes Matt Justice point is obviously there are bad people but we dont need another countries bad people.
yes Took all of 30 seconds to find that. A lil research beyound Fox would do yall some real good.
no Eva Graham just STOP. Please
no Such a made up crisis.  Liberal media and politician just ignore it and continue to push the "trump is  manufacturing the emergency"!  BS
yes immigration overhaul
yes You cant spell TRIUMPH without the letters T.R.U.M.P.
yes Trumps a disgrace. He needs to be impeached, then imprisoned!
yes They are all about if getting rid of all guns saves one life, it's worth it..... But lets keep the illegals and push abortion up to birth and after.... Hypocrites....
yes Babi Nikki How can you be so cruel to say that the loss of her son has less concern or value or evil than another loss.  I feel sorry for you and will pray for people like you.  And I hope you never loose a child or loved one under these circumstances  And I also think that you must be a socialist communist democrat to make such a statement.  Shame Shame on you.
yes No they dont work
yes Wendi DelValle sorry for your loss
yes Gabriel Bergeron if you dont support sensible gun reform, you dont love the US.
yes I dont think our nation gets it,
no Cynthia D Melrose DUH! Which way did he go?

no Kiyan Michael
no That estimate on what illegals cost this country appeared based on a paper by FAIR, which released an updated report in 2017 that claimed taxpayers "shell out approximately $134.9 billion to cover the costs incurred by the presence of more than 12.5 million illegal aliens, and about 4.2 million citizen children of illegal aliens" at the federal, state and local levels, with "a tax burden of approximately $8,075 per illegal alien family member and a total of $115,894,597,664."  The $116 million figure included services like health care and education, as well as spending on agencies like U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, minus the $19 billon the group concluded those who are living in the country illegally pay in taxes. But it also included costs associated with the children of those immigrants in its tally, even when they are U.S. citizens.
no ABSOLUTELY AND FAST.  No more unnecessary loss of life.
yes Keep 'em against the ropes
no Ok u need to peace make my mother real mom
no John Garrison your government makes million bringing it in, so build a wall against them while your at it.
yes You didnt say what illegal or where from
no You mean like the parents of the kids at Sandy Hook, Parkland, etc?
no I am sure you Russian Bots & Putin want to keep the feeble minded in America excited; about getting Trump's Wall of Hate.
no The President should have a meeting with Dennis Michael Lynch and work on immigration.
no Many illegal immigrants are law abiding people who provide for their families.  Then, you have these good for nothing pos that do nothing but occupy space.
no Build it tall
no David Proud It IS the point.  Gun Violence is a way BIGGER national emergency than illegal immigration...
no Why is it that when a Parkland Dad writes an editorial about gun control you won't post? Oh that's right, the #NRA gave you $30 million not to. #hypocritical #MAGA
yes Agree...build the damn wall.  One murder from an illegal is one too many.
yes We are not being disrespectful , there are people killing people down here all the time ? We have corrupt police ? We feel play a be part ? What is being done about it ? Nothing as far as we can see ? You have our support ! We need a wall ! We also need something done with the corruption ? Corruption kills people we never see , just by the action of it ?
no Justin Fox oh but the money could be used in so many other places.  Lets start in Flint for water for the people. Shall we?
yes Complete? Not One (1) effin' FOOT of New Wall has been built by this administration !
no Get er done Mr President!
no Sacramento Mendoza
yes The reason Democrats don't want walls is because they get kickbacks from all the drug cartels... That would stop all of that
no I hear oxygen turns you into a violent criminal, you guys should stop using it... 
no Flint still does not have clean water!
yes Don't let this distract you from the fact that Hector is going to be running three Honda Civics with Spoon engines. And on top of that, he just went into Harry's and ordered three T66 turbos with NOS... and a Motec system and exhaust.
no Youre the ugliest president ever
yes Charlesetta Brown dumbest comment today
yes Steven Keslar god ur gay. How about he does what hes doing
yes Whats so terrible about a wall? A wall is great, almost any other country would put armed guards that shoot on site coupled with a mine field if they had this many people entering illegally, btw look at what they do to people that enter Mexico illegally they are not put up with 2 hots and a cot like they do in the U.S.
yes We didn't cancel when Obama was (small p for ) President. He led the way for not being one
yes Someone on here is a whiney baby that reports everything to Facebook because they can't handle the truth. Walls do work and have worked for centuries.  If you can't handle the truth don't go onto these threads. People who report comments to Facebook when the comments aren't even hateful, bullying others, or threatening are violating people's right to Freedom of Speech. If you can't handle the truth get off the page and you are apart of the problem thus a whiney American Democrat. Stop making false allegations to Facebook because you can't t handle the truth. You know who you are.  If you have a door with a lock on your house to keep people out then we need a wall to keep people from Mexico coming in.  All LEGAL AMERICAN CITIZENS have the right to Freedom of Speech.  I have the right to my comments and so does everyone else. If you can't handle the truth go to a page where you will be coddled by others.
yes John Garrison they dont want to
no Did your yahweh create everything while it is everything that knows everything? If yes then your yahweh murdered this girl.
no Bad photo shop job
yes That's terrible. Instead of the wall, a better idea is to allocate resources towards stopping Nazi meth biker gangs and incel-shooters born in the US. Pay attention to stats instead of anecdotal evidence. Drunk driving is unique to immigrants, and US citizens don't do it?
no 2 Mass murders in the last TWO DAYS by AMERICANS.
yes BUILD THAT WALL...
no The President got more yays than nays I like that He is President of the USA
yes In other news another WHITE man killed multiple people
yes So very sorry . This should of never happened .
yes ^^^ but a wall will keep us safe from illegals
yes Go TRUMP I'm from South Texas and boy the wall been needed a long time
yes Deanette Christopherson Yea Im aware. But a wall would be a physical tariff. It would regulate the amount of drugs as well I
no AGREED
yes The border crisis has been going on for years and the liberal can has been kicked down the road for too many miles..  it is time to put up a wall, with entry doors called Port of Entry.  Immigration is an old white  colonialism concept that is no longer required since the unknown lands have been conquered and established.  Anything more than that is an invasion. Build the wall
yes Gods, you trumptards falling for this three-hankie story.  You idiots need to live in N. Korea. They have a very, very, very, secure southern border!  With its own dictator, you'll be truly happy there!

yes Meanwhile, he's taking money from the military infrastructure budget which will impact housing for OUR military. It's already a disaster in some areas. This emergency is non-existent! Our real emergency is getting Trump out of office. He LIES every day. Did you know he requested that Japan nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize? What a joke this unpresident is!
yes sacrafice liberty for security
no Kidon Gadol nope genius I'm not.
no No socialist POLICE!
yes Marge Hackett, legal points of entry is what I wrote
yes Stop worshipping greedy trick noise
no FINE SIR
no Trump 2020!
no Even one death is to many !
yes Thank you for all you are doing for the American people!  Build the wall!
yes And the tunnels under the wall? Will the wall stop them too??
yes Why didn't work in third - world countries?
no I'm not voting for you in 2020 either.
yes Mike Gruenfeld Oh go cry in your koolaid somewhere else.
yes Nikki Graham How do you know this? Did you read the bill? Who is your source?
yes This pisses me off
no Keith Webber Jr. = ignorant trumpanzee
yes John Gardner 300 ? I saw 64...and you want to put fake labels on people ?
yes illegal is Illegal.
yes Great leadership
yes Don't know, that why you're crying to me?
yes How many mass shootings by non-immigrants?
no when a close family member is killed these politicans will get it maybe
no Build the Wall !!
yes You will have to start reading those bills yourself ....and you should have already noticed that ...you are surrounded by traitors who fear nothing because they have always gotten away with their crimes....and it seems you will do nothing about them as well....
no Adam Somerville   Trump 2020. Absolutely. 20 years for treason, 20 years for obstructing justice and election fraud.  Not to worry,  With proper therapeutic intervention you will some day come to terms with the realization of having betrayed your country at the ballot box, handing it over to a Russian crime syndicate headed by a mentally and emotionally damaged New York City gangster.
yes Yes sir ! God bless Donald j Trump family
yes Then why does DJT allow the mentally ill to purchase semi auto weapons ? Thousands are killed by US citizens. Oh right, feeding his base on fear and lies !
yes Pretty sure your highest priority is lining your own pockets while feeding a large pile of scaremongering bullshit to gullible rubes
yes russian trolls
yes http://www.nbcnews.com/id/44206940/ns/us_news-life/t/man-who-saved-girl-says-hes-illegal-immigrant/
yes Absolutely the best President!
yes Matt Justice so are those crimes equal in your eyes? Clearly we have our own issues but dont need to import more.  It would doubly bad if they werent supposed to be here and raped.
yes An illegal alien killed my niece.
no Article IV, Section 4 of our Constitution REQUIRES our government to protect and defend our borders. If government does not, the Constitution, by virtue of the named part herein, AUTHORIZES the Free Citizens(s) to defend themselves and their state in place of TREASONOUS GOVERNMENT. **note; In NOT defending our borders, government gives "aid and comfort" to a hostile foreign invasion; and THIS, under Article III, Section 3 of our Constitution is properly labeled TREASON!  THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT, REPUBLICANS STAND BEHIND OUR PRESIDENT OR GET OUT!
yes Shane McInnes well said bud
yes Yes, Walls do work. That is why the left is fighting against it.
yes https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN1BG2V1
yes Thank you President Trump for all the great things you have done for us.
yes Lord hear our prayers
yes Well, we know there's at least one person in Washington who cares (President Trump).  Democrats couldn't care less.  Illegals are their number one priority.  American citizens are not.
yes Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
no BUILD the WALL President Trump. Its funny how the Clown Democrats Pelosi and Clown boy Chuckie don't want the wall,but BOTH of these CLOWNS have secured fencing around their houses.
yes Such evil times we live in.  Good in you Trump
yes Walls can't stop a determined immigrant, he/she can either chose to dig an underground tunnel or even climb over the wall...how about you just come up with a good policy.
yes YES SIR, PRESIDENT TRUMP! BUILD THE WALL !!!!!!
yes Walls dont bring dead people back maybe see if therapist instead or try thinking for yourself
yes Heartbreaking story, I am so sorry for this family's loss. Thank you President Trump for giving them their voice that Beto wants to keep silenced.
yes What about all of the northern States like the one I grew up on that border another country and have no walls?  It sucks that you can't find a job with the skills you have, maybe try learning Spanish or move to a place where speaking Spanish isn't a job requirement... If 45 knows things we don't that make it crisis now that is more important than helping the Americans in California or Puerto Rico then why did it take so long for him to declare an emergency? Why didn't he do so in the first 2 years of his term when he was trying to get this done? It's not an emergency if you wait 2 years... Jim Jenkins - if control laws take lives, that blanket statement would mean you having a driver's license, being married in the government's eyes, or opening a bank account take lives... there are many countries with stricter gun laws that have lower crime rates. That point on gun control laws was also just simple way of showing that if you support a wall because it could save one person's life, then you should also support guns laws as they would save one person's life, or healthcare for all as that saves one life, or a full transition to renewable energy as that saves one life... more wall is a waste of taxpayer funds if it doesn't deal with the majority issues used to manufacture its need as an emergency, namely illegal immigration and drug smuggling.  Lastly saying that relatively few innocent people are killed by a gun is just plain nonsense. Try telling that to one family members that was killed in any number of mass killings in the last few years from Sandy Hook to Las Vegas concert goers... and stricter gun control doesn't mean law abiding citizens cant own guns, it just means they have to jump through a few more hoops. You loved your wife enough to file paperwork with the government declaring it, why cant you do the same with your gun? You wanted to drive bad enough you took a test showing you knew how to do so safely and show back up at the dmv every few years to reregister your license, why wouldn't you also do the same to own gun?
no Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin 14) Energy   ~ Presidential Memorandum to clear roadblocks to construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline.  ~Presidential Memorandum declaring that the Dakota Access Pipeline serves the national interest and initiating the process to complete construction.  ~Opened up the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to energy exploration.  ~Coal exports up over 60 percent in 2017.

yes So sorry for your loss!  I stand with President Trump!
yes Build the Wall High And Mighty!  Prevent future Democratic voters!
yes Yes we must!build the wall!!
no The sad situation has become a National Emergency. Please continue caring for ALL Americans as you 'Build the Wall'!
yes Among the problems in the United States, building border barriers is safe for US citizens. The foreign issue is denuclearization of the North Kim Jong Eun.  When the North Korean Kim Jung Eun, which is called the axis of evil, is removed, American citizens naturally like Trump.
yes There are too many innocent people being murdered every day and if you look at it long and hard you can see that it all is happening because there is no border wall to keep illegal immigrants out.  Weather it is from their drugs laced with fentanyl or weapons they brought with them or illegal immigrants who think the laws do not exist or pertain to them.  Build the wall and make them come through legally and catch the drugs and weapons at the port of entry!  We can't take care of our own.  Why are we still taking care of them.  The money it takes to build the wall will be cheaper in the long run from the money we save from Narcon used to save drug attics, medical, shelter and feeding illegal immigrants not to mention the loss of life we have to endure having them here.
no Linda Durbin Hes playing golf again this weekend.
yes We know the president is right. We know its the dems resisting. Sickening & so sad

yes Walls just like locks only keep the honest thieves out.
no Trump

yes Then do something about the Mass Murders. You have the power to make change, but won't.
no This is so sad.  I watched yesterday as President Trump pointed out the Angel Mom's to the people that were there and the fake media.  I did not see many of the media looking at these mother's.  Sat there looking at their phones,  Shameful and Sad!!  What if something like this happen to their family?
yes Why do you not care about the thousands of Americans dying at other American hands? You are still 1000's of times more likely to get killed or assaulted by a US citizen, but don't let that fact stop your fear mongering.
yes Carl Ostendarpnot asylum illegal immigrants lying to get asylum status deportation is the only solution
yes Sorry for your loss.   Build the wall
no No Brainer amen www.magapill.com
yes In addition, U.S.-Mexico trade has been duty free for more than a decade, and the renegotiated trade deal does not add new tariffs on goods coming from Mexico to the United States
yes I wonder if trump can land his stealth bombers on their foreheads.
no #SB13 FreeTheStates.com #IGNOREROE Courts don't make laws #EstablishJustice #StateSovereignty #AbolishHumanAbortion #CHURCHREPENT FederalBeast.com
no We also need tougher laws
yes Indeed!
no Do you mean speaking truth?
no Paul Johnson Mr Affluenza killed several people; he was legal, Caucasian and barely served any time.
yes God bless sir!
no Could it be one of the illegal immigrants working on Trump's properties???!!!... Bunch of fucking assholes#impeachthemotherfucker!#americasdumbestpresident!#fuckingmoron!
yes Laurie, get a real FB  page before replying to my comment.  Yours is fake
no God bless our Angel families. Thank you Mr. President for fighting for our future as a Soveriegn Nation. People need to be vetted and come here legally. No more freebies.
yes Thats ok with the  on the left . Kill babies unborn and already born , but dont a animal that was convicted of murder. This is Democratic Party, ok but dont bother the  that comes across our borders.
yes Kay Mike White LIBERAL males you mean, no but more people are murdered by illegals than white kids, and teh illegals can be dealt with only this way, I dont think there is a cure for liberalism sorry.
yes Yes and AMEN
yes Were all immigrants, specially trumper
no Kevin Llamas Jurez What did you want him to do...take our guns away? The socialism is strong within you!!
yes CliffandKim Ferrell   Not to worry,  With proper therapeutic intervention you will some day come to terms with the realization of having betrayed your country at the ballot box, handing it over to a Russian crime syndicate headed by a mentally and emotionally damaged New York City gangster.
yes When are the Democrats going to wake up and back Trump. Build the Wall.
yes We support our president!!!!
no The statistics say otherwise.
yes Silvia Serra Lobo But you dont need any facts apparently!  Cough up your supposed facts to disprove what he said libtard!
no Prior to 911 we didnt need id to fly... So many of these people out of the 11 million came.. Many years ago.. There not crawling threw the desert
no Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin this does not even take into account the NAFTA deal he negotiated..The part media fails to inform you of is what the NAFTA deal means and how Mexico IS going to pay.... I'll explane...  ~It forces USA metal to be used *(HUGE for American jobs and American steel sales generating billions) and it will keep automobile manufactures in the USA (worth billions).  ~Americans bought $71 billion more imports YEARLY from Mexico than vice versa. That's about to change in Americans favor.   ~At least 30% of the cars must be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour to keep American car manufactures in the USA (That increases to 40% in 2023:) Autos that don't meet these requirements will be subject to hefty tariffs.   ~Canada must open up its dairy market to U.S. farmers. It will eliminate its complex pricing scheme for Class 7 products. That includes milk protein concentrate, skim milk powder, and infant formula etc.   ~It opens the wine market in British Columbia to American wine. (Billions to America).  ~Mexican trucks must meet U.S. safety standards before crossing the border.   ~Provides more protection for patents and trademarks. Saving tons to American's who have been ripped off of their ideas & costs Americans billions and also helps reduce black market.   ~U.S. drug companies can sell products in Canada for 10 years before facing generic competition. Extending it by 2 years. (Billions generated)  ~Companies can no longer use Chapter 11 to resolve disputes with governments, they will now have to pay up instead. The only exceptions are U.S. oil companies.   ~We no longer fund Mexican abortion clinics. Exports drastically reduced, for one example sugar from Mexico cut nearly in half, creating more jobs and revenue, tourism industry hit hard, federal employees banned from traveling to certain main areas.  *Of course, Trump didn't really expect Mexico to just write the US a check as some ignorantly say as "fact" :)
no Daniel Bremmer you actually think illegals trek thousands of miles with a ladder?
yes Replace all of those a##hole  dems.
yes A white male killed my naturalized citizen friend...what can we do about that? Stop exploiting these few victims when we have true national emergencies, like another white male shooter yesterday! #Fearmongering #propoganda
yes What about the 5 Americans shot and killed in their jobs, by another American.  Guns are the emergency, get rid of guns you stop the killing.
yes But I never go to doctors for sniffles....we farmed and knew how to stop the illness of our livestock.And everything else that goes along with a lifestyle of working for others...it's not just a job.But we couldn't afford health insurance. My husband was a very successful business man but we had no control over the price of our products.I worked for nothing but insurance for the last two years of his life at a school till  he passed from a rare neurological disease at 64. Insurance may not have prevented his death,but the quality of his life would have been improved.It can happen to anyone....no sniffles here.......cause I know the difference between life and death...and what a wall can and cannot do.
yes Devon Wood - "Things" change.. Lies don't
yes they will take a plane. 400$ only
yes Of  Course we need a Wall ,We need to do everything possible to stop the Criminal element from coming into our country  ,  Right now it's very bad for our country.  Guns in the wrong hands will always be a  fact ...Are you saying Guns shouldn't, be allowed ? Americans need protection from Drugs , and , all the politicians making it a reality .. I see a Country  that is being controlled by  people like Soros , I see Our Great President Trump  trying his best to go forward with a Wall and ,security for Our America  to protect Our great Nation  .. Its time to  be proud of our country again. ( Taking  Guns from the honest man will not remove the  Guns  from the depraved  segment of society )
yes NOT ALL ILLEGAL IMMIRGARNTS ARE THE SAME
yes Oh so sad. We must protect us from evil.
no Mike Marsh yay....
no Bull O'Neill  and then why is Trump ignoring these problems?  At the Rose Garden speech..why didn't he have Parkland families there?  Explain that
yes the Democratic Party is wrong not to be backing the people of the USA.  I'll never forget their unAmerican/ungodly ways.
yes How would we know that without one?
yes I am so sorry for the most profound loss in your life.  I support the wall.
no It is no longer hyperbole to say that our president is a fascist. #thankstrump
no Debbie Bauman I'm sorry. Nothing like it. It's really tough to lose a child. How old was your son?
yes Thank you President Donald Trump, we Africans (Nigerians) are proud of you.
no Mitch Haynie ....its called the military for these types of issues not a wall buddy....
no Illegal immigrants have been killing people in Wales for hundreds of years.
yes absolutely.
no And what about the settlements of Muslims who wont assimilate and are anti Semitic and now voted into congress? Stop chain migration and mass entry through legal means!
yes Your wall is ridiculous. Please focus on a real crisis. Fulfill your promise of health care. Too hard for you to understand?
no Emily Neal we are discussing the wall.
no Amen  Build the wall
yes The Mexican drug cartels have a lot of money and they know how to invest it to maximize their illegal profits. During the national discussion in this country about legalizing marijuana it was suspected that a large amount of cartel money went into swaying public opinion away from the legalization.  Is it possible that cartel money is now being used to change public opinion and the politicians opinions on the construction of the border wall between Mexico and the United States? I am just wondering now
yes what is wrong with the dangerous Dems in Washington, they refuse to work to keep America safe, instead they are working to bring thousands and thousands of illegals here that we taxpayers have to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for their care and worse, put our Border Control agents in danger..  this is nuts.  and what's with Joe Biden, typical Dem, goes overseas and attacks Pres. Trump - what a fool,  gives a speech in Munich, how disgraceful, that is just what Obama used to do - travel overseas and attack us and our country, he always apologized for America.   i am waiting to hear if Biden will plan to run in 2020 because he needs to answer one important question - is he going to continue to take his son Hunter along on government trips so Hunter can come home doing BIG deals in foreign countries like he did when Biden was VP - Hunter flew with his father to China on AirForce 2 and made a HUGE business deal for himself. of course the US media never made a fuss over that.      https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6712807/Biden-repudiates-Trumps-policies-Munich-speech-saying-undermined-Americas-moral-leadership.html
no Amen Build that wall
yes My heart goes to the man but big fucken shame on you for politicising someone's loved one's death to gain support for you're stupid ass wall
no Whatever
no Danny Jones Time for your countrymen to stand up and rise up just like Winston Churchill did
yes Mathew Bake des he built one in oval Office with Lego Stones.  But this was it . Later in Prison He finde a Lot of Walls who surruond him. Orange is good Color for workingsuite
no I'd love to help build the wall! Trump 2020. Then in 2024 maybe we can get Ivanka!
yes Why wait til your loved one is on the list?  Stop illegal immigration
yes How many other daughters were killed by Americans?   A lot more than one. More bullshit.
yes Border security, but no stupid, expensive, archaic border wall.
yes Nancy and Chuck are murders!
no Tony Sherrard, we will leave that to the democrats
yes Ok, don't give up, build this wall, if necessary pullout ur troops from Afghanistan too. ur useless troops in Afghanistan can protect that wall.
no Turns out, unpacking the history of Russian mafia's take-over of Fred Trump's territory + watching the 2016 online activities of Roger Stone's khaki-pleated neo-Nazi Incel tikitwats = front row seat to treason.
yes WALLS DO NOT WORK.  Stop using victims as props!
no God bless you Mr. President!
yes Wally you don't give a "rats ass" about anyone but yourself !!
yes How many times will the Democrats turn a blind eye to the needless deaths of American citizens in order to protect illegals?!
yes Do you want a wall? Boarder Protection? You got it for all your life savings with 10 easy payments  including shipping and handling.
no Well we all know it wont stop it but it will HELP ALOT
yes Keep going Trump.   We agree with you! We will no longer appease these awful democrat traitors hell bent on destroying America.
yes John n Morris and maybe you need to call 1 866 go Jack off!
yes How many deaths are attributed to illegal immigrants in the past calendar year? Now compare that to gun violence in this country by our OWN citizens? Ill wait....
no Charlesetta Brown Printing money every day was so easy for him...
yes You have some nerve
no Hat about Parkland and the thousands in the US who were killed by male citizens.  That seems to be an emergency
yes Americans killed 35.000 people last year in America. Wake up voters.
yes 39 mass shootings this year (4 or more people shot) none by illegal immigrants, would the wall help that?  Too soon? Walls didnt keep undocumented workers out of Mar a Lago. Maybe Pinocchio was too busy campaigning to notice.
yes How about the parents from Parkland shooting!?!?
yes Stay the Course Sir... MAGA!
no The death and loss of of one American in this silly context cannot be excused. Build the #$@# Wall!
no Keith Webber Jr. Many National Emergencies were called prior to President Obama (why you all bring up Obama and Clinton all the time...get over them...focus on now)...but did Obama want to take money from the military or drug intervention programs? Trump himself ...in the Rose Garden... said..after he declared a National Emergency....he didn't need to do this now.
yes Obama? Lol
yes To all the people that want illegals in this country sponsor one put your money where your big-ass mouth is
no Eddy Coulson, why are you such a shithead? I suppose you want to open up the border and abort babies "you people" should be aborted starting with your mother after all she had defective children. I bet you are Gay..........here a picture of your mother and your brain.........
yes If everyone  wants  to  see  results  start flooding  the  democratic leadership in the Congress and Senate members with e-mails and  phone calls  pointing this out.  Next election  time  reminded  them of  their  complicity in the  deaths  at the hands of  illegal people at the  polls,  and if you are not registered to vote,  then on Tuesday  go to register to  vote.  For the truth  is  that  most Democrats are  hypocrites. Nasty Nancy Pelosi has over 25,000 homeless people in her district,  los Angeles  has 58,000 homeless people yet they refuse  to address that issue,  but they will gladly  allow illegals sanctuary in their largest cities  and  financially  secure  services  for them.
yes Walls won't work, cause' we are constantly evolving to our surroundings, and the last thing we need is a flying Mexican
no Ed Wrany how. About. All the people. Idiot brings in. To work at his golf. Course. McConnell brings in. Hundreds. Of. Taiwanese. Because his wife wants them here
no Im so sorry for your loss!
no Are you a paid troll Carlos, or a freelancer?
yes You shouldnt have signed the bill!!  We need a wall and the emergency declaration will be challenged and it will never get done.
no LOL he is guaranteeing a wall will stop people from killing lol.  Now I've heard it all.  That is like saying more gun laws will stop people from killing.
no Apple Rivera don't waste this countrys money
yes I just want to know why us citizens have to pay out of network when ALL ILLEGALS are OUT OF NETWORK And pay ZEROOOOOO   https://youtu.be/NgbQIJ5pUDk
no He has been working nonstop lately let him play golf once in awhile obama did and went on many vacations on our dime
no How are you protecting us from the domestic white Terrorists?  Youre not and they kill more then immigrants, legal or otherwise.
no Temicka Brown blame the local government over there. He sent 100m in 2017
no God bless our GREAT President and First Lady! Best POTUS and FLOTUS ever!   #PresidentTrump2020! #MAGA! #WALLSDOWORK!
yes Obummer will enjoy prison life from what I hear.
no So sorry  the way you lost your daughter is such a tragedy. We must declare that those who want to harm Americans must be kept out !  We must secure our borders and defend our Nation ..... so sorry for your loss
no More trump Bullshit:    The Actual Facts about  'Murder and Extremism in the United States in 2018'  'ADL, EXECUTIVE SUMMARY'  'Each year, ADLs Center on Extremism (COE) tracks murders perpetrated by all types of extremists. The 2018 Murder & Extremism report provides key insights into the crimes, including motivations behind these violent attacks.  2018 was a particularly active year for right-wing extremist murders: Every single extremist killing  from Pittsburgh to Parkland  had a link to right-wing extremism. Among this reports key findings:  Every year adherents of a variety of extreme causes kill people in the United States; ADLs COE tracks these murders. In 2018, domestic extremists killed at least 50 people in the U.S., a sharp increase from the 37 extremist-related murders documented in 2017, though still lower than the totals for 2015 (70) and 2016 (72).  The 50 deaths make 2018 the fourth-deadliest year on record for domestic extremist-related killings since 1970.  The extremist-related murders in 2018 were overwhelmingly linked to right-wing extremists.  Every one of the perpetrators had ties to at least one right-wing extremist movement, although one had recently switched to supporting Islamist extremism. White supremacists were responsible for the great majority of the killings, which is typically the case.  Deadly shooting sprees were a major factor in the high death toll. Five of the 17 incidents involved shooting sprees that caused 38 deaths and injured 33 people.  The perpetrator of one of 2018s deadly shooting sprees, at a yoga studio in Tallahassee, was connected to the misogynistic incel/manosphere movement. In the wake of this attack and a similarly-motivated killing spree in Toronto, Canada, ADLs COE now tracks such incidents as extremist-related killings and has updated its database to include an earlier incel-linked incident, Elliot Rodgers 2014 shooting spree.  Firearms remain the weapon of choice for extremists who kill. Guns were responsible for 42 of the 50 deaths in 2018, followed by blades or edged weapons.'  https://www.adl.org/murder-and-extremism-2018
yes you are a small percentage do not need 5billion sorry facts
no Its amazing to me how no one acknowledges the fact that the root cause of the accident is a DRUNK DRIVER, not an illegal immigrant.  Maybe we need to bring back prohibition
no Yes Trump is right, n he cares enough to take all the hot wash from his enemies to make us safe!!!
no Alexandra Ica Hanciu what genocide  lol
yes I agree withvmr. Trump. The wall must be built.
yes You will notice on these threads that conservatives engage in logic based, constructive dialogue, while most of the emotion, and misinformation comes from the left? What does this say about the people being voted in by the dems? I just don't meet very many smart liberals out here in the real world
no If the illegal doesnt get into this country, neither does his gun he carrys
no I am a different kind of person, you see if one of those rat hole bastards were to kill one of mine. I would hunt him down like the dog he is and would burn him very slowly to DEATH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yes Illegals killing our people is only a very small majority why don't you people look at the facts
yes Ed Wrany you are a donkey he shut the government down for 35 days and put government workers with out pay grow up he is a baby if he can not get what he wants
yes Trump is protecting you and I so why would anybody go against this hardworking country loving and God loving President?  I stand with Trump because he genuinely cares and has out performed every President that has come before us in my lifetime.  President Reagen was great and Trump was by his side.  Thank you Trump!
yes A crazy white guy killed my father, and walked away with no jail time. His name is Bobby Guthrie. The cops were so overwhelmed they got it confused with an incident that happened on the near block so no one was there in time. Evidence was missed and ive looked so the guy walked if you want to put a massive amount of money somewhere put it in the police force. A wall wouldnt have helped my family.
yes Worley Michael   Haven't you heard???  Russian collusion and the Trump campaign, ZILCH, ZERO, NADA, NOTHING!!!! NO EVIDENCE OF RUSSIAN COLLUSION!!!!   LOON!!!!!!
yes God bless the dad.
yes Copy pasta

yes THEN LETS DO IT....BUILD THAT WALL
yes Nah democrats want to ban guns already..Liberalism is really a mental disease.
no Fully support Donald Trump The safety and prosperity of the United States is above all "We need a safe wall" The Democratic Party will pay for this wall construction project I say Democrats will have to spend money on this wall   "The United States needs security, not Democratic Party."
yes Donald J. Trump is guilty of fear mongering and incitement. His removal from office won't come soon enough.
no Thank you for putting America first.
no Que love TRUMP PENCE for ever the best our hroe  l
no Dummycrats only think the rich deserve walls
yes I suggest you step down Mr Trump, forcing a bogus national emergency upon America is something I know you know what you are doing and thats why I am calling it out but many don't get it and likely won't. Perhaps that is why you have gotten this far.
yes Jeremy Harbolt dont lock ur doors then....
yes Julie Albers Hampe I guess if you like drug traffickers, child trafficking, and gun smuggling then thats up to you.
yes So why did Trump sign a open border, amnesty bill that incentivizes illegals with children to come here and is predicted to culminate in the biggest surge of illegal crossings ever? Sorry Trump you betrayed us and unless you have a plan to rectify these laws asap, I'm off the Trump train
no Just shows our politicians only care about power and money. Donald can only be in office for 4 more years then it's back to the same old.
no GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP.
no yehaaa build that wall, a uk supporter
yes Trumps fake emergency is a sign of weakness, not strength.  He ran on the wall, he had two years of Republican control of Congress, and he still couldnt get it financed. Weak president!  #OrangeMoron #WeakPresident #SeanHannityLapDog
no Charlesetta Brown the recession was in 2007 and 2008. He did nothing to end the recession. It was the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates to 0.
no Build that wall!!!!
no Just say no to caravans ....BTW !!
no Huh a couple of Americans put the  Middle East into the heap of mess it is today. You don't see any of the Arab nations banning you folks. While I do deeply feel sorry for your loss, I do also think that such a generalisation isn't something to be trifled with...
no Linda Gayle Hutson is good they are doing that to the president
no YES THEY COME HERE BUY CARS AND DRIVE WITH OUT LICENSE MANY THINK AGAIN OUR PRESIDENT DONALD  TRUMP IS TRYING TO PROTECT OUR LIVES HE IS FIGHT AGAINST TERRORIST AND IN LEGAL PEOPLE ISIS AGAINST DRUG SMUGGLING INLEGALS I VOTED FOR TRUMP WILL AGAIN IF I AM STILL ON EARTH LIFE IS SO SHORT TRUMP HAS DONE MORE GOOD  THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT    HAS SINCE KENNEDY
no and theyre on a steady increase now...60,000 a month
yes Bullshit as usual the wall will definitely not work waste of money
yes Danny Jones Don't listen to the bigots here. My second moms is in the UK and trust me I hear how bad it is. Takes a good heart and some bravery to sat what you did. You're very kind and I truly hope these hateful people do not take your sunshine away
yes Are you stupid?  You're definitely confused; You confused  Obama and transgender wife Michael with President Trump and First Lady Melanie. You really should stop smoking that pipe, come back to reality, start drinking coffee. Wake up. Find God and support the truth not like Obama the father of all lies. Keep in mind(,if you have one, or can find it) that Trump is not a politician, and is the main reason Trump is President. Politicians lie honey Trump has proven himself to be a man of his word. BTW take those CNN blinders off and be apart of the solution not another liberal liar supporter of Globalization. It will be here soon enough with out your support.
no Amen my brother, we're with you, build the wall.
yes Thank you President Trump for your dedication to secure our border and protect the American people!! We trust you, stand with you and support you 100%. We know you have our best interest at heart.  God Bless You and God  America!!! #TRUMPPENCE2020 #FINISHTHEWALL
yes I believe a investigation should be done on Nancy and Chucky on there financial background and see where all there income comes from!!!
no NOT BUILDING THE WALL HASN'T WORKED SO WHY NOT TRY IT. ATLEAST TRUMP IS STEPPING UP AND TRYING TO DO SOMETHING.
no BUILD IT!
yes You .... are a country made of immigrants ....
no Lmfao he has a joint Facebook account with his wife who TF would've ever guessed that he'd be a snitch
no Tim Masters if the tradgedy happened to you would you feel the same? Doubt it
yes So sorry for all the angel families.
yes Don't Americans kill fellow Americans daily? Are we gonna build a wall around them too?
yes Janet Woemmel-Spicer
no The deepest swamp in the US is the corrupt Trump family - that's the national emergency
yes Funny you should mention El Paso...isn;t that the city with some kind of wall that was put up on the grounds it would way lower crime rates...but the city was already among the safest in the country and its wall didn't lower crimes rates...?
no You lie. You couldnt care less for Dems and you cant help but blurt it out every day.
yes Beverly Harris but they come in illegally. And bring in drugs and gangs
no THE WALL WILL BE BUILT!
yes We have to have a wall ...Do you want this in your neighborhoods ???
no Happened to my family too
yes BS!
no Terry G. Taylor if you are an American you will be chosen for the job after they have filled their illegal obligations.  They past really does repeat itself
no Create an executive order that all democrats have to tear down the walls around their homes and must accommodate illegal immigrants.
yes Trump not keep nobody safe,because all the people in DC will not work with him. All you do carry your gun and protect yourself.
no Hitleresque propaganda is fucked up.
no http://www.coolstuffinparis.com/le-passe-muraille.php Make the wall awesome
yes Loretta Sleavensky yes!!! Keep the gun toting Americans out? Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher.
yes Bullshit. You declared an emergency then went on vacation
yes Well,,my husband died from poor medical treatment...no walk was gonna give me good health insurance.
no Another point of 'illegal' immigration is the impact it has on our economy. I'm a construction general contractor, I have seen so many people in my industry struggling to find jobs or decent wages due to the influx of people here illegally who have infiltrated our construction job markets. This is taking jobs away from sovereign citizens of the United States and most of them send a large portion of their income back  to whatever country they came from, hence, depleting the monetary circulation of our internal economy... Build the wall!
no Just keep doing the great work you have done for two years. We see it, appreciate, and thank you for it.
no So sad we deserve to be kept safe
no Why are dims against it, before they voted for it?
yes Build The Wall High And Fast President Trump. The Real American People Are With You Sir. Thank You For Saving America and Her People.
yes Liberal stupidity is rampant.  Hey Libs you get to scream at the sky on Monday at noon!!
yes Sir my condolences but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver. Are you part of Mother Against Drunken Drivers. In that area many have been hit or killed by drunken drivers- what is being done?  Dont Drink and Drive
yes "Illegal Immigrant" is just a nice way of saying criminal,,There are thousands of people in prison for lesser crimes.
yes And the victims of Orlando, Las Vegas, & Marjorie Stoneman Douglas, what do they get? Oh yes, thoughts and prayers aka absolutely nothing.
yes Stop with the lies already, walls don't work and they won't keep us safe. We're not paying for a billboard for you to plaster your wife raping pedophile face on.  https://www.cbsnews.com/news/border-patrol-agents-have-discovered-at-least-230-cross-border-tunnels-since-1990/?ftag=COS-05-10aaa0h&utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&utm_content=5c4a8a3b3ed3f00001512fb6&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=facebook&fbclid=IwAR0J1uIo9b_RhMR7yskRM-q317Sbv-UDsQZzMNNAPr5VkHJgWt52L3d2xOU

yes trump 2020 build the wall
yes How many lives do we need to loose before people realize WE NEED THE WALL!
yes People dont realize that these people coming here the wrong way could be criminals. Also they try to bring drugs over in turn kill our loved ones.
yes Cut the cash flow and they will go! Mandatory e-verify, voter Ids, end chain migration, cut off the freebies like healthcare and welfare and free education from sanctuary cities Donald J. Trump
yes Tim Masters right and Congress over the years handing power to the executive branch is the problem too.  They have to take back what they got lazy about and handed off.  Executive branch can now create laws and regulations all on their own in different departments
yes AND THEN SHOOT TO KILL ANY ONE TRYING TO JUMP OVER
yes Another challenge for our President.  Presidenc Trump has broad shoulders and perseverance, HE WILL BUILD THAT WALL.
yes Stefan Beukman

yes Lisa Mann A Wall will make it much more difficult and time consuming than just walking in.
yes An illegal alien who had been deported 7 times killed my best friends ONLY child along with another young girl that night. He simply just snuck back in every time. Cant help but wonder if it hadnt been so easy to sneak back in if those poor girls would still be here.
yes The dictator is a fascist and and a crook and will be in prison soon.
no What about the hundreds of families who have lost a child to gun violence in their schools? Why do you not own their pain?
no Id feel a whole lot safer if trump was behind a wall... preferably outside the White House, out of power, and without twitter.
no Alberto Venditti certo..
no Luis  Lpez Good luck with that! Smh
yes You haven't convinced the people , and you haven't convinced congress . You declared your national emergency already, now let's see how you do in courts ... So Stfu about it and move on to other issues .

no Ryan VanBuren , very weak argument
yes All for the wall!!!!!!!
no We need sea walls.
no Amen...
no "If Trump gets any more incoherent, the right-wing evangelicals will claim he's speaking in tongues."
yes Stop giving them welfare, food stamps, free medical care, cell phones, and housing. They will stop coming. We need Immigration reform and voter ID.
yes If an emergency can be manufactured over border security when illegal border crossings are near a 20-year low then its a snap to make the case for an emergency over gun deaths, which are near a 20-year high.
yes What about the mother's that have lost children to gun violence? There are substantially more of them. Yet you do nothing about that. Why?
no Nobodys against the wall their against trump getting credit for it

no Build The Wall.
no A Trump supporter murdered a bunch of people in a Jewish temple in New Jersey too.
no What about the school shooters? Are they mexicans?
no concentration camps are welcome in America... well apparently not in America just to divide America
yes Telling the dems, or reminding them of these tragic stories does NOTHING.  Their agenda is more important.
yes Wendi DelValle  so sorry for your loss! The peoples president has your back he WILL build the wall!!
no JOKE  An Englishman, and Mexican cartell,  and Osama Bin Laden were all in the desert when a genie appeared and said he'll grant each a wish. The Mexican cartell went first and asked the genie if he would make the land in Mexico fertile so the dope crops could flourish, and there would never be famine. With a flash the wish was granted and Mexico forever fertile. Osama Bin Laden was next and he wished for a wall surrounding all the muslim countries so no western ways could corrupt the perfect muslim way of life, and with a flash there was the wall all around the muslim countries. Next was the Englishman, he looked at the genie and said, please tell me more about this wall, so the genie said its 5000ft tall and 100ft thick nothing can get in or out, so whats your wish? The Englishman pulled out a cigar, lit it and said, FILL THAT WALL WITH WATER!
yes A bunch of white men committed mass murders in this country centuries...i dont think its a wall we need
no God bless America. God bless Trump
no Please build the wall. We are with you Mr. President Donald J. Trump
yes TRUMP IS A JOKE!!!!!!!! TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE A BUNCH OF IDIOTS!!!!
yes Sharon George Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher.
no So sorry for your loss Sir.  May she RIP.  Yes President Trump truly cares about this country and all it's citizens..  It's the democrats and socialist who want to take over
yes Any of you bleeding heart lefty libs wanna ask this man, or Kate Steinles dad, if they think there's a border crises!!?? I didn't think so you hypocrites!!
no Should have been a clean DACA for the Wall bill.  Thats fair.
no THE POPE LIKES HIS WALL!!!
yes Anyone who opposes securing our southern border is a traitor this nation!
yes I hate this argument.  Don't get me wrong - America should get her beautiful southern border wall...  But this argument is entirely emotional - there is no rationality to it whatsoever...  Then again people are emotional beings - this kind of message may be an essential part of a rhetorical arsenal.... but I still hate it...
yes If walls didn't work why do all those demoasses have walls around their homes. The United states can not take on the whole world at one time. If the wall allows that, build it.
yes My father was also killed by an illegal immigrant on February 17, 2017. We must have the wall and deportation!
yes Cheryl Bowler Schrager, you mean its despicable for anyone to tout gun control by using victims as props?
yes https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/2890714002
yes May Our Lord, Thy God Almighty in Heaven continue to Bless you President Trump and all the Trump family in continuing to MAGA and One Nation Under God blessing you in all ways and forever in your life .

no #BUILDTHEWALL #NICEANDTALL #THANKYOUMRPRESIDENT
yes Henry Bilboa I saw about 3 or more posts of Americans killing people and sexually trafficking kids. I didn't tag you either.
yes People love addressing every negative encounter theyve had with anyone that looks Mexican.  Can we address police killing people along with mass shooters?  Pretty sure those problems arent gonna be solved with the wall
no BUILD THE WALL!!!!!   STOP THE INVASION!!!!    No amnesty.    Get in line like our ancestors did!!!
yes That's because he wasn't a pregnant illegal alien. They can get free Medicaid along with their anchor babies!
no Useless Democrats don't care.
yes Lets bring the rest of the world up without collapsing our civilization!
yes Betty Bilbrey Exactly.
no President Trump is making a bill for DUI,, criminal offense, best president ever Trump 20 20 
no Triumph comes not by force but by wisdom. A strong wave will bring ruin to what it touches but in its wake you've discovered a cleansing of the shores...
yes Throw........ MS. Nope already got trump getting dump over the wall and let the Spanish and cartel take care of him. Then.... Tear the wall down

yes www.sultan.org
yes HERE ARE THE NUMBERS WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND: Yale University released a study (October of 2018) by three researchers, all of them liberal I believe, who concluded the actual number of illegal aliens in this country is not 11 million--it's north of 22 million. Twenty-two million.  The Democrat Party is now, as a matter of policy, calling for the legalization of ALL illegals in this country, citizenship voting rights. 22 million new voters. The overwhelming majority of first-time immigrant voters vote Democrat.   The largest margin in American presidential history was 17 million votes in a 1984 election between Mondale and Reagan. 17 million. You would add to our voter roles 22 million at least permanent electoral majority, in perpetuity.  That's what this (this insane resistance against President Trump and his call for building a southern border wall) is all about. It's not about making the country better, serving our labor needs, and helping the population. It's about putting Democrats in power, FOREVER.

no What will you do when a white man shoots up your church then?
yes Adrian Dahlstedt We were already great! Trumps a scam artist
yes Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin 16) Defense  ~Executive order keeping the detention facilities at U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay open.  ~$700 billion in military funding for FY 2018 and $716 billion for FY 2019.

no No because the money set aside for Homeland Security in the future will only be raided by Democrats and used on welfare, abortion and the climate
yes Sorry
no Dawn Duff trump troll indeed.
yes For the safety of all Americans build the wall!
no Should built a roof too since most get here by plane...
yes One life lost to someone on our country illegally is one too many.   Stop the madness.  Put Americans first
yes What about all the us citizens that have done all those shootings I don't see trump do anything about that but yet he is doing so much to but a wall that won't work
no So sorry for your loss.  It should never have happened!
yes Even if you dont get the wall built youre still gonna win 2020. I dont think the Democrats understand how many people are against late term abortions !! That alone will get Trump reelected.
yes Those white inner city shootings in Chicago are out of control
yes Yeah...such an emergency.  That's why it's taken him two years.  And, he's only getting 55 miles.  You Trumpers are the dumbest species on this planet; what's left of it.
yes Very sad situation, however, violence from illegal immigrant pales in comparison to that of school shootings.
yes they feel special and don't want to stand in line
yes Trump needs tofuck off   hes a self serving bastard
no "WE STAND WITH YOU MR. PRESIDENT"
no Ok Mr. President you are truly great at fear/hate mongering, how about you do something presidential now.
yes just look at britain if you dont believe him, we are fucked
yes This our last chance under President Trump Build that Wall & abolish the Democrats God bless you President Trump now you know how Custer felt at the little big horn we are with you all the wall .
yes Timothy Kershner So we should import  more criminals illegally? That's a old weak talking point!! You my friend are the one that need to shut up!!
yes No.   You are wrong.   Perhaps we should ban WHITE men/boys because of the mass murders they committed.  The Las Vegas murders, the Miami murders, the Parkland school shooting, and let's not forget Timothy Mcvey (sp) etc...etc...  I think a white man just killed five co-workers and injured fire police officers...mmmm
yes LEGALIZE CANNABIS! ! ! THX
yes You should not have signed the Omnibus Bill that you just signed!  What were you thinking; this only made our battle worse and gave more rights to illegals.  Not happy with you Trump.  The wall is only one part of border security.
yes Secure our border and prevent criminals from being exported to our shores
no In a sense, the wall merely represents the Trump administrations worst instincts and desires. It is harmful, wasteful, and offensive, but an ineffective wall is nonetheless better than the surge of 5,000 new Border Patrol agents and 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to round up and deport people that the president also wants. No wall has ever arrested, robbed, battered, or murdered nonviolent people, as immigration enforcement has. A wall will not create an interest group to lobby for itself, endorse nationalist presidential candidates, and demand more power and funding, as the Border Patrol union does. The wall is more than a symbol. It will harm the lives of thousands of border residents and immigrants while wasting billions of tax dollars. But in a world run by nationalists, the one small source of comfort for non-nationalists over the next four years may be the knowledge that it could be worse.  -  D.  Bier - Cato Institute
yes Denise Paige  if the border is over 2000 miles long 200 miles of wall won't do anything they will have 1800 miles of no wall to still come across.
yes PUT UP THE WALL!!!!!!!!!
yes President Trump thank you for fighting for America. The low life cowards in DC never saw you coming. Wish more of the Republicans new how to fight so you wouldn't be alone in this dirty street brawl. Though our history certain men were born to accomplish great things and I think you were so burdened
no Trump is a terrible president and shouldn't have been one. I would rather take my chances with Hillary than with trump. He had a tantrum like a 2 year old child over a wall he didn't get so he she the government down, he got rid of Obama care, and he also forcefully took kids away from their parents. That's not making America great again like every one thinks.
yes Thank you for the emergency declaration to build the wall, President Trump. TRUMP2020. MAGA
yes Propaganda
yes AGREE
no Teresa Pagniano where did he get his first dose?
no Nazi's used propaganda like Trump does to condemn the Jews. Demonizing an entire group of people for the crimes of the very few is never justifiable.
yes Excellent Mr President

no GET OUR WALL BUILT WE NEED IT
yes BUILD THAT DAM WALL FAST.
yes Lmfao.
no YES
no Listen up. It is written.  No question about it. The wall is necessary to secure our borders and protect the Nation of United States of America and its population.  Sir, excellent decision. Lets finish the wall necessary to secure our borders and protect the Nation of United States of America and its population.  Israel re-built there wall in 52 days during the Bible OLD Testament time with no modern tools as we have today in the 21st Century.  Nehemiah 6:15-16 New Living Translation  The Builders Complete the Wall  15 So on October 2d the wall was finishedjust fifty-two days after we had begun. 16 When our enemies and the surrounding nations heard about it, they were frightened and humiliated. They realized this work had been done with the help of our God.  Definition of enemy plural enemies 1 : one that is antagonistic to another; especially : one seeking to injure, overthrow, or confound an opponent 2 : something harmful or deadly alcohol was his greatest enemy 3 a : a military adversary b : a hostile unit or force  http://biblehub.com/nlt/nehemiah/6.htmbiblehub.com
yes Send this snake to Satan!
no Mike Charles wall
yes MISTER PRESIDENT! OVER HERE
yes " 'I didnt need to do this,' President Trump insisted at a Rose Garden appearance on Friday, as he declared a national emergency aimed at shaking loose a few billion dollars in financing for his beloved border wall.  "The presidents assertion was both ludicrous and self-defeating. If a declaration was unnecessary and the wall on track (the wall is 'very very on its way,' the president said earlier in the week), how could he claim to be addressing an emergency? As Mr. Trump explained it, 'But Id rather do it much faster.' A presidential desire for speed does not constitute a crisis  no matter how eager a president is to camouflage his failures." - NYT Editorial Board  "This weeks bipartisan spending bill, which contained no more wall money than the one over which Mr. Trump shut down the government in December, was a particularly humiliating defeat.  "Desperate to save face, the president and his team cooked up a nonemergency emergency with the aim of seizing funds already appropriated for other purposes. Currently, the plan is to pull $2.5 billion from the militarys drug interdiction program, $3.6 billion from its construction budget and $600 million from the Treasury Departments drug forfeiture fund. The White House plans to 'backfill' the money it is taking from the Pentagon in future budgets.  "And so, in a breathtaking display of executive disregard for the separation of powers, the White House is thumbing its nose at Congress, the Constitution and the will of the American people, the majority of whom oppose a border wall.  "Even as he spun this as an act of strong leadership, Mr. Trump acknowledged that his declaration resolves nothing and creates a host of legal, legislative and political troubles." - NYT Editorial Board  https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/opinion/trump-border-wall-national-emergency.html
yes What will president hannitys next order be????
yes Yet you do nothing to stop people like the Aurora shooter.
yes Peter Darling, way too funny! Dwindling base??? Actually, according to RCP, Trumps average approval is only 1% below his highest. See below for the truth   Poll	Date	Approve	Disapprove	Spread RCP Average	1/25 - 2/14	43.6	53.6	-10.0  Rasmussen	2/12 - 2/14	50	49	+1 FOX News	2/10 - 2/12	46	52	-6 Economist	2/10 - 2/12	41	57	-16 Reuters	2/6 - 2/12	39	57	-18 Politico	2/7 - 2/10	45	51	-6 The Hill	2/7 - 2/8	47	53	-6 Gallup	2/1 - 2/10	44	52	-8 CNN	1/30 - 2/2	42	54	-12 Quinnipiac	1/25 - 1/28	38	57	-19 All President Trump Job Approval Polling Data  As far as Manafort goes, all this narrative about someone who was sent to prison over something that wasnt even a part of the 2016 campaign. Amazing!
yes waiting 2 years to declare an emergency is hardly addressing an emergency if he waited until after he didnt get his own way to call it , he just needs to keep his base happy so he gets a second term
yes If you would like to report illegal aliens, please call Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at 1-866-DHS-2ICE (347-2423). They will need to know names, locations (either work place or residence) and any other specific information you can provide. #BuildThatWall
yes They will help a lot
no Krishna Shree Jones Jebaraj country  should be protected from capitalists, liberals  and conservatives and especially white superamascist patriarchal men. Do that america does not need a wall. Since trump is a white superamscist he would spray hatred on Asians and Mexicans.. infact majority underpaid exploited unorganized sector is of these people. Before building a wall one should realize who has built america .
yes Resign!
no What culture?
yes This is so easy to solve this problem. No wall needed. Just stop giving them free EVERYTHING and they will stop coming.
yes How many were killed by USA  Citizens, with GUNS yesterday ???
yes Paulo Americo Rocha very few attempt crossing the desert it is a very long and arduous Journey through train that most of the year will kill you from dehydration in less than a day.  I assure you it is much easier and more common for someone to hop in the trunk of a car then it is to cross the Sonoran Desert.
yes I support the wall and the great things this man is accomplishing. In the public eye and outside the public eyes. Your a true patriot Mr. President! And America needs you!
no In 2017, those arrested for immigration offenses had a combined 2,028 homicide charges and convictions in their records.  What about them?
no How many parents in America complaining that guns killed their kid?
yes What u got as a valentine gift Donald? A tiny wall on ur backyard
yes Gee..dont you people stay up with news? We have had more shootings in America by white Supremists than by Hispanic immigrants..do some research..you will find that a wall is not going to solve your problems....how about gun control...? Ever think about that?
yes YES! Thank You Mr. President Donald J. Trump
yes Trump is gay

yes WHITE TERRORISTS DISRUPT AMERICAN LIFES MONTHLY... WHITE TERRORISTS HAVE KILLED MORE PEOPLE THAN ILLEGALS
no Sue Howie it was because of the dumbocrats and you know it. The dumbocrats in office are sick minded pathetic excuses for human beings. They should all be put on sinking barge and put out to sea. Let them govern the sharks.

yes Build the Wall!!
no Petion is online to impeach Pelosi and Schumer!! Sign it!!The wall needs to be built! Charity starts at home! Take care of our citizens first then help others! We give money to many countries billions start here first!!!
no President Trump can you have the new Attorney General and the  DOJ  investigate if El Chapo gave millions of dollars to Clinton, Pelosi, Schiff and others? I'm a concerned American  citizen and veteran  that has been hearing that he did, but he was silenced. Thank you for Making America Great Again
yes I agree!!
yes Last year, a Canadian man stabbed a Michigan police officer.  Donald J. Trumps failure to declare a national emergency and fund construction of a wall along the northern border is inconsistent with his recent assertions to the American people.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1GY00I
yes Dems seems to forget about all the people affected by illegal immigrants. From murders, robberies, illegal driving to identify theft and all the companies who pay illegal immigrants under the table to avoid paying taxes. These people who come in illegally cost the US billions of dollars.  But dems would rather let them in to illegally vote in elections.  We need to be safe!  Walls work!
yes DAMN..RIGHT THEY WORK...ITS TIME TO CLEAN OUT THESE ANTI AMERICAN DEMOCRATS
yes the real American emergency! https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/16/us/illinois-aurora-shooting/index.html
yes Be afraid. Who just shot up his workplace yesterday killing five? Stop the f*cking fear mongering you idiots.
yes I am seeing repeated posts oh trumps pr team working over time

yes You are allowing yourselves to be used as pawns
yes Dwight Haddix I guess me and Trump have that in common then.
no Ive lost count their have been so many this last year. Build The Damn Wall. Fix all the immigration loop holes, end Chain migration, end all Sanctuary cities and no more catch & release. Get it done it will save American lives. 
yes Mohsen if dont like trump good bye.Teump is doing what mo PRESIDENT has balls to do it.
no Especially in the vulnerable areas!
yes Thank you President Donald J. Trump for protecting the USA as your highest priority! We the people appreciate all that you do!
yes Yes Sir!!
yes Chris Jensen
yes Not to minimize what this poor father experienced.  What are you doing about the real emergency of thousands of children being murdered by guns every year? Cant wait until we get a real president again.
no Jo Sechi Surely you're not implying that deaths caused by illegals are less significant because they are fewer than gun related deaths? And to go all the way back to 1968 to inflate the number? How many gun related deaths last year? This year so far? How many of those are outside Chicago? Don't preach to me about gun control. The number of American babies murdered since 1968 far outnumber the American lives lost to guns. SIT DOWN.
yes What about protecting our kids and families from shooters like yesterdays,  Illinois shooting?
no Ed Wrany worrrrrst president there ever was!! Worst than the second bush!!
yes I can not beleve that this new democrat party has as many supporters as they do . I think every single nut case in this country are the only people supporting them . mentally ill voters are more dangerous than mentally ill gun owners
yes Build the Wall Now.
no Ron O'Hearn  Whipping is cheap and effective, you can even train animals with a whip.  It's actually the way I was trained to have respect for the rules.
no President Trump 20172025 As you said in your SOTU speech,  "If walls are immoral and don't work,  Why  does bitch pelosi  have a wall around her multi million, dollar mansion "???  Thank you God's  speed and God bless America and  your family,    Indict  bitch clinton,
no So sorry for your loss. BUILD that damn wall. So these bastards cant come in and kill people one way or another
no Josie Macias also your comment isnt showing up for me either. Idk why Facebook does this
yes Having incompetent Presidents in the past has cost us all......about time someone was looking after those who do the right thing
no Janie Rogers Doss  yep!!
yes Wow this is insane
no Lauren Vaden
yes It's literally a fact that native born people are more likely to be violent than illegals. Again I'm not for allowing a free flow of illegals. Just the statistics
no Timothy Kershner that doesn't mean every illegal is now ok. That is the 0000.1% of illegals.
yes Larry Martin .. I don't have to ask anyone, he's done more so far than many past Presidents and that's even while having to deal with all the bogus accusations and investigations. I'm certainly sure that he's doing more than what Hilary would have done!
yes Wall and electric fence +drones with guided missiles please President.
yes Texting while driving is one the principal causes of car accidents in the world... lets build a wall around cellphones too
yes BUILD THE WALL NOW!!!
yes A completely useless death and a travesty of justice. Is Beto willing to allow his kids to be victims?
yes It must be 25th amendment, 30.
no Linda Durbin; last post 5/15 Comments are full of these revived, foreign, & newly created Facebook accounts to show support for propaganda and spread discord.
no I cant get over the fact because an illegal took your loved one makes your grief heavier then mine, a broken heart is forever, in some ways mine is worse, guns are passed out like candy in this country, if my grandfather was shot by an illegal Id be saying how the hell did he get a gun?but because he was a citizen everyone said its his right to own a gunI will never defend the right for all the crazy people running around with guns, look what just happened in Illinois a sicko killed 6 co workers and injured 5 cops, build a wall that will protect from mass shootings, gun violence the real threat to this country
yes Sorry for your loss. I agree we need the wall
yes The Parkland shooter was a native-born American the killer in the factory in Illinois was a native-born American not immigrants 8 billion dollars for wall is stupid when people in California have burned homes to the ground when people in Puerto Rico are struggling still America can help not only at home but across the pond Haiti Venezuela wake up Trump better yet get out
no Now hear this there is no national emergency at the southern border when the president is off playing golf and of story no wall... Sorry for your loss
yes mARXIST cOMMUNIST LEFT =jEWIISH INTERESTS
yes What about mass shooters? What about drugs flowing into the country at the ports ?
yes I want to donate... Is the link legit?
no Many have been killed by shooters who were citizens.  We have a gun problem.  I
no A legal citizen kills people everyday.   What idiots
yes The Great Hoax of Open border (ILLEGAL) Immigration Policies will be exposed by history as one of the most evil and corrupt actions by our Capitalist Political Establishment. It benefits those with capital who want to employ cheap labor. Our middle-class and low income disproportionately suffer the ill effects and social burden of this sick self serving policy. Thats assuming all illegal immigrants we welcome here arent criminals but just good people appreciative of the opportunity to bare racial and economic discrimination for the many opportunities USA provides. Criminals, Gangs, Terrorists, Social misfits and Powerful Transnational Crime Organizations are able to exploit this horrible policy to our detriment, again overwhelmingly disproportionately affecting the middle class and poor. The people who all these lying politicians have been saying for decades they care about and work for. POTUS Trump is working to force common sense immigration reform because he truly does care about Americans and our country. Controlling our borders is essential and the easiest place for him to begin this reform. 
no Danny Jones  The 39 billion is the divorce bill that we HAVE to pay to the EU.muppet!
no Who is going to protect us from homegrown domestic terrorism?
no YOU ARE THE BEST PRESIDENT EVER.
no De Bolden take your privilege line and shove it up your ass.
yes Marcia Harrison Rayne yes
no Agreed!! This country is the joke of the world!!
yes An illegal imigrant killed a girl in my home town and forever changed the life of another!
no Democrat communists dont want to make America better they want to make America worse so they can hidr their crimes
yes Jo Sechi , Still dont want  Illegals here period. And dont want more gun controls. You have to realize that good Americans dont commit gun crimes. And according to the department of Justice more deaths are committed by hammers than rifles in the US, so pick your poison and believe what you want. Gun laws infringe on the 2nd Amendment. And ban Shaiah law Nationwide too.
yes Trump On!! WALL!!!
yes trump!! great man
no Wat if they come by tunnel? Like how Pakistanis entering India .
yes An American full blooded shoot my grandfather to death, dead is dead

no This is definatly a spirtual war we are fighting in this country. Wars get very bloody but we are ready!!!!! Majority of America stands with our PRESIDENT We  have never had anybody in office that would stand for the people and stand rock solid like Trump has done!!!!! All through God's word, he sought out for strong, courageous, faithful at heart for His cause and places them in postion. NOBODY could have ever withstood such flaming darts from the enemy as Trump has. He is definatly planted in this position by God. Even the great Moses became weary, Exodus 17:12.  (Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.) President Trump, we are your Aaron and Hur!!!!! Your supporters are your armorbearors!!!!! We support you and also take alot of poisonous darts everyday for this great country!!!!! The left is not of God and most of us know what we are battling. We lift you, your wife, family and your administration high and lifter in prayer everyday. Gods WALL OF protection around you all.
no Your son Junior will be very safe behind thick prison walls.
yes Yes, we need the wall!! NOW
no Get it done!
yes how cute,  pobrecito hid his comment from me 
yes Our President Donald Trump is the best President ever and the democrat communists are the worst of the worst
no SATURLITE FRACTURED JAW TITIANIUM? CLOCK IT NANNU HAWKINGS WITCH DEAD
yes So would it have been better if it was an American who killed her? Im far more worried about a fellow American killing me than an illegal immigrant. Stop trying to highlight every murder by an illegal immigrant to push your agenda!
yes Sorry bro both are a joke.
yes Brian Feeley Chuck Schumer is the biggest HYPOCRITE GOING!!!!

no BUILD IT Mr President ! Quickly
yes Still trying to convince people of your wrong doing.... your perspective is scewed
yes I was in Isreal last year. They put a wall up from Syria and crime went down 80 percent, especially terrorism. We have some misguided people in office.  Time to change their dance card.  They've been wined n danced too long.
no NO! To illegaly crossing any borders!!! If it takes a wall, then heck YES!!!
yes WOT SOUND DO THE FOXES MAKE ?? NNNNNNNNNNN BUM BUM SOSAGES
yes The "stable genius" is so dumb, he doesnt even know that weather, and climate are different things. He is so dumb, he cant close his own umbrella, he is so dumb, he mispells Hamburgers as hamberders. If you read a transcript of ANY of his speeches, they make no sense. Its gibberish. He is the worst speaking President in history. He is so dumb, he doesnt believe in science. He is so dumb, he believes 99.9% of the world's scientists, are playing a climate change hoax on him. Im sorry, but if you believe Trump over every scientists in the world, youre probably dumber than he is. If you have been alive 20 years, u cant tell me that winter is the same as it was 10 years ago. He ignores these facts bc he personally makes money off natural gas and oil. He has a motive for denying science. His supporters have no excuse besides being gullible, and stupid.
no Roy Norwood it's over your head Roy, don't give yourself brain free.
yes Steve Martin I'm sure you will not be calling it a false alarm when it affects your family and children. The Angel parents know it's very real. You'd think you would be funny having that name.
yes By proxy the democrats that oppose the border wall killed her by their inaction on our security.
no YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE.... THIS BS OF USING ILLEGAL HAS GOT TO STOP.....ILLEGAL IS RHETORIC THAT SEEMS OFFENSIVE TO OTHERS....!!  I'D RATHER WE SAY..UNWANTED,  UNDOCUMENTED.. UNCIVILIZED  LAW BREAKING BEING.....!!!  YES..THEY'RE ILLEGAL,  BUT, EVEN IF THEY WEREN'T..RHE ACTIONS OF TOO MANY HAS BEEN HORRIFIC... THE OUTCOMES..BEYOND COMPREHENSION.....!!!  ENOUGH...!!!  WE THE REAL TRUE RED BLOODED BORN AMERICANS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA MUST STAND FIRM.....FOR OUR PRESIDENT AND OUR NATION.....!!!!  SPEAK UP .. SPEAK OUT...!!  SHOUT IT OUTLOUD.....!!  TO ALL BEINGS HERE THAT BROKE LAWS.... WE ARE DONE SUPPORTING ANY OF YOU.....!!!  LEAVE.....! GET OUT...AND DON'T COME BACK....!!!!
no Hmmmm...What about the unborn being aborted and torn apart EVERYDAY IN AMERICA! ..... Shouldn't we be saying, a DOCTOR IN AMERICA KILLED MY SON OR DAUGHTER!.. Plus, he was, PAID FOR IT! WAKE UP AMERICA! It's NOT a choice!
yes So when the wall does nothing to cut the crime rate in America, he will have to point the finger at another group of people. So be safe and don't belong to any group.
yes #Resign Donald J. Trump
no "If Americans who Hire harbor or give welfare to illegals were imprisoned for 5 years you would not need a wall or even a fence"
no Are you talking about killing indigenous people of America?
yes I with President  Trump  100%
yes So one daughter is worth more than 14 kids in Parkland?
yes https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/51112586_10218015968013047_144837176373280768_n.jpg?_nc_cat=1&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.xx&oh=403cf388720000ae216aa974a9f098ad&oe=5CFA0718
no So what about the killers here in the U.S. we will never have a safe Place without killing they're all around u WITHOUT u even knowing until they get caught up...
yes Kimberly Danik We need to move on...Obummer did his dirty work, now we have to do EVERYTHING in our power to fight back, make America stronger again whatever it takes, so join American organizations, make new friends and strengthen the bonds of old friendships, buy American, support all things American, vote for Republicans across the boards, and run for local offices whenever possible, have meetings, conversations, celebrations, f2f positive interactions with anyone and everyone and discuss what is happening in our country, encourage each other, write letters, sign petitions, get involved in your local schools, churches, Vet groups, hospitals, nursing homes, etc, etc, this is the way we are going to #bebest, to achieve what the POTUS asked of us in his SOTU speech, to be excellent in all we say and do, and to unite for the sake of our future. I personally am going to become a foster/adoptive parent now, and hope to influence many kids over the next 10, 20 30 years or however long I have, caring for them and teaching them all the great American values that will enable them to become great citizens of our great country. Also, I have started to write down any pertinent names, info, addresses, email, phone #'s and I contact the appropriate offices, when I learn about any person, entity, politician or group who are doing anything I feel is harmful to our American way of life and freedom. For instance I have been writing, calling and signing petitions to have traitors such as Rashida Talib and Ilhan Omar and also Linda Sosaur ousted from their positions, and at least bring attention to them that shows how many citizens want something to be DONE about their slanderous and evil words, behaviors and deeds. It has to stop, and the majority of American citizens feel this way, or else Trump would not have won the election. There are MILLIONS of us who can do these things that I am talking about, and these are respectful, legitimate and peaceful ways to get our point across and to get results. I hope you will join my efforts, thank you and may God be with us! 
yes How about this: at you next rally and press conference about the Wall, you display large photos of everyone killed by an illegal with their date of death printed on them for ALL the press and people to see.  To finally drive a nail into the idiots that refuse to see the need for the Wall.
yes Sylvia Grimes so you turn your back on your family don't tell me you don't have family in Mexico all Hispanic do in family if you look into your family back ground .
no Beverly Rothgeb
no Too bad Jim Acosta (CNN) does not agree with border security.  He needs to go back to Cuba and enjoy Socialism/Communism.
yes So sorry for your loss. Yes President Trump needs to finish the wall!
no Remember Democrats are unamerican and dangerous to United states of America....God bless you and the family
yes ILLEGALS NEED TO BE DEPORTED FOR THIS STUFF!!  Not put in jail, DEPORTED and if necessary their whole family, maybe then they'll catch on to LAWS are made for a reason and you need to obey or GO!!
yes A very high wall!
no There are so many stories like this, with people who NEVER should have been in our country killing Americans. NOT UNTIL someone in Pelosi's or Schumer's family is murdered by an ILLEGAL will those bastards wake up and help secure our border.
no Im so sorry that these Dems dont give a damn if you lose a loved one its only about their agenda nothing else! Pray to God that these evil people will come to their senses
yes Dave Callender Moronic comments.....
yes Don't back down Stand your ground We pay taxes for protection and we demand and deserve it. Thank's a lot Democrats,Hollywood and bias media.I'm sure everyone knows some one who over dosed on fentanyl lace heroine.It's killing Americans and 90 % of it comes over the southern border and so does 75% of the heroine. Think about that every time you stick up for the Democrats.Build the wall or let more kids die,plain and simple.
yes https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-sanders-2020-vermont-senator-says-hes-running-for-president-in-cbs-interview-political-party-views-stance-on-issues/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7e&linkId=63780371&fbclid=IwAR3PN47LJmaDhkbswmR7pSrKTobg7gSaak-DunLk8qoauxh9XxhXyto20G4
yes Thank you!
no A white guy killed over 50 people watching a concert in Vegas...whats being done about that other than my thoughts and prayers....
yes By that logic, an illegal immigrant saved my life. We need to tear down any type of border.
yes Just like the demo leaders using shootings to further their gun grabbing bullshizz??
no I totally agree Janine!
no The real threat is Americans. How many immigrants committed mass murders is United states? 0!
yes What about the shooting in Aurora? I guess you only politicize violence when you can manipulate it to support your own fearmongering.
no Go Trump maybe we the people need to go down together build the wall Gov support the supplies
yes You are the greatest President, I know you can do it the best you could for the Americans citizens people to build the wall for our safety. We need the wall for stopping illegal immigrant crossing to our border by saying that my son's car got hit by ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS and the car he drove NOT even registered on his name.
yes Its a presidents #1 responsibility!  Build the wall and increase ICE AND BOARDER PATROL FUNDING!!!
yes They are some strange aliens. They cant be from this world.
no Ruben Palomo I don't see the relevance...
yes who killed those FIVE people in Aurora and FIVE in rural Texas ? Don't they count?
yes He's under 17 criminal investigations.  Nothing great about him.
no https://www.facebook.com/groups/384296842094377/permalink/508906516300075/
yes And who would be the first to blame President Trump if an illegal killed one of their family members because a homicidal immigrant walked across the border without detection because there is no deterent like the wall.  Hypocrisy in the highest form Demwits!!!!
no An immigrant saved my brother from being robbed
no Thank you, President Trump! Walls Work! The Democrat Party is void of sustainable ideas that attract voters -- so they have been importing them -- actually paying them to come with taxpayer money. A country without a border is no country. Congress should repeal Senator Edward Kennedy's un-American immigration law. We want the world's best and brightest if they swear allegiance to our country only and to our Constitutionally protected Liberties. Most all the rest should work and go home, just like foreign laborers in every other civilized country, until recently.
yes Jim Thornburg background checks aren't the problem  , they steal them or buy them off the streets
no So sad my prayers for them
no So are abortions, which is worse ?
yes https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-took-putins-word-over-us-intelligence-on-north-koreas-icbm-2019-2
yes so sorry for your loss. I agree with you for many reasons
yes Wall by itself isn't enough We also need to be learning fluent spanish and some dialects so we can hear trouble coming. It would be Really Nice if a clear enforcement partnership existed with the Mexican government, too.
yes That is a sad story but it has nothing to do with the wall or a "National Emergency".
yes Chuy Jesus Santy sunday comics isn't a history book , go to the library and grab a real book
yes If I was a Mexican criminal, why wouldn't I go north?  No wall and sanctuary City morons will even protect me!
yes We also need Congress to change the laws to stop catch and release. Send them straight back if they are caught illegally. This release within 20 days because the courts so backlogged will never get fixed otherwise.
yes An illegal  immigrant  almost killed my boyfriend and father in law. Hit them in the back  made them roll 4 times and he ran!! Still got away with it. He was drinking and driving...president Trump build the wall!!!
no Someone run against Nancy in California and all her friends and vote them out of office .
no AMEN
no Statistics dont bear out this story. Anecdotal evidence is not statistics. You can cherry pick stories, but it doesnt change reality. A wall is ineffective and a waste.
no Walls do not work
yes Steve Ware whats your point? Every country has bad citizens that do bad things. Thats why we have prisons. That doesnt mean we want illegal people from other countries that also includes bad people.  We have enough of our own to take care of.
yes Linda Gurtz Hildreth big deal
no We need the wall!
no Why doesn't he care about all the children killed in schools????
no More Americans are killed in America by white Christians Americans.
yes Alyssa Marie Duran shut up
yes What kind of wall after the Vegas shooter?
no I can understand someone feeling this way if their child is killed by an illegal. I would feel the same way.   But lets look at the numbers.   106,000 Americans are killed every year by adverse reactions to prescription drugs. Thats 12 people every hour that could be prevented.  And theres no crisis or emergency for the families of those victims. This isnt even on the news.   From all available data, it appears that illegal immigrants (mostly gang members) only kill about 77 people a year in the US. Compare that to 106,000 killed by drugs or 250,000 killed every year by medical mistakes.   https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugInteractionsLabeling/ucm110632.htm#ADRs:%20Prevalence%20and%20IncidencePreventable Adverse Drug Reactions: A Focus on Drug Interactionsfda.gov
yes Bull crap. You are an idiot. Your base is a congregation of the kids who dropped out.
no Your loss is heart crushing.  I understand.  What I don't understand is WHY it is only the handful of victims killed by "illegals" are worthy of sympathy?  There are murder victims every day all over this country.  Families of those victims aren't deserving of notice because it doesn't further trump's agenda.  Why do other victims not matter?  They too are somebody's child/sibling/parent.
yes Yes... What happens when  white kill  Black.. Hispanic.. Asian. Same white an kill Police officers..
yes God bless you.
yes So sorry for your loss.   WALL
yes For more than a century, innumerable studies have confirmed two simple yet powerful truths about the relationship between immigration and crime: immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes or be behind bars than the native-born, and high rates of immigration are associated with lower rates of violent crime and property crime. This holds true for both legal immigrants and the unauthorized, regardless of their country of origin or level of education. In other words, the overwhelming majority of immigrants are not criminals by any commonly accepted definition of the term. For this reason, harsh immigration policies are not effective in fighting crime. Unfortunately, immigration policy is frequently shaped more by fear and stereotype than by empirical evidence. As a result, immigrants have the stigma of criminality ascribed to them by an ever-evolving assortment of laws and immigration-enforcement mechanisms. Put differently, immigrants are being defined more and more as threats. Whole new classes of felonies have been created which apply only to immigrants, deportation has become a punishment for even minor offenses, and policies aimed at trying to end unauthorized immigration have been made more punitive rather than more rational and practical. In short, immigrants themselves are being criminalized.
yes Lie
no Jamie Rochelle if we had the wall less people have to lose their families, less Americans have to grieve....but you dont care about them....right?? Until that illegal goes and gets drunk and kills your family....we dont hear about that because they dont collect that data.
no If the wall saves only 1 innocent life it is worth every cent.
yes Walls won't stop this, and you ignore this emergency.   https://www.abc15.com/news/data/mass-shootings-in-the-united-states-when-where-they-have-occurred-in-2019
yes So true Donald Trump
yes Socialist DDR build a wall in Berlin. It did NOT work.
yes IF THE 5 PRESIDENTS BEFORE TRUMP HAD USED THE MONEY ALLOCATED FOR THE WALL MAYBE THEIR DAUGHTER WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY..............
yes Candy Chen digging a tunnel makes it more difficult and time consuming for the cartels.

yes Eva Graham How many people have been murdered by Illegal immigrants VERSUS How many people have been murdered by white Americans lets say in the last 10 years?
no Maga!! Build the wall
yes MANY MILLIONS OF AMERICANS AGREE WITH YOU. WE MUST BUILD THE WALL FOR AMERICAN'S SAFETY.
no Send the military to California and build the wall.
yes Lynn Limauro Floyd  firing squad is better
yes YES YES WHAT IS WRONG WITH THOSE STUPID PEOPLE GET THE WALL DONE
no Until Prisons are safe of Drugs and Crime then we should support a Wall.  A National Emergency should have been when School Kids were Slaughtered by White men with AR's.. Let that sink in Chump..
no Build the wall Mr. President, Trump 2020!
no Build the wall our country needs it for our children's future
yes Build that wall around the Demodopes
yes In February 2009, Congress approved Obama's $787 billion economic stimulus package. It cut taxes, extended unemployment benefits, and funded public works projects.  The recession ended in July 2009 when GDP growth turned positive.  In just seven months, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act pumped $241.9 billion into the economy. That increased growth to a robust 3.9 percent rate by early 2010. By March 30, 2011, almost all ($633.5 billion) of the funds were spent.   2. Modernized the Auto Industry Obama bailed out the U.S. auto industry on March 30, 2009. The federal government took over General Motors and Chrysler, saving three million jobs. It forced the companies to become more fuel efficient and therefore more globally competitive.
yes well diaper donny lied to you his wall will be tied up in the judicial system and won't get built just another one of his lies
no Oh dear
yes If there were only ONE person killed by an illegal  immigrant; the (complete) security wall should be built!
yes Build the wall way to many entering illegally.
no #SecureOurBorders
no Dave Callender How many people have been murdered by Illegal immigrants VERSUS How many people have been murdered by white Americans lets say in the last 10 years?
yes Who's going to protect America from YOU, you creep ????
no Thank You Mr President!
no a legal resident killed over 50 in vegas...wheres the wall around vegas tbh.....
no This is plain not true. Trump does not care about all of us at all. Wake up voters and see it is you he has harmed the most.
no Betsy Hammond  Yep so many more REAL emergencies than the stupid wall. What a Con
yes Yep, it's called personal responsibility and being aware of your surroundings.
yes The Democrat Party has every sociopath in the world trying to take a swing at a us.
no It's sad the left cares more about illegals than the Angel mom's. You never see Angel mom's on CNN or other leftist news shows.
no Not slow--nonexistent matt f.
yes Yes, yes, yes!!
yes Pandering to the lowest denominator as usual. All surface and no substance. I guess it work for you.
yes Including all the gun deaths that are created by Americans like in Illinois yesterday?
no I am sorry for your loss, but that American can face the charges, instead of being protected by sanctuary cities or deported,  only to come right back.
yes Build the wall. Start a go fund me page. Lets get that money and build it.
yes Thank you President Trump for building the wall and protecting the boards
no Kent Wojahn  well said!!
yes Lies, lies, lies, LIES!!
no U dont give a crap, youre just trying to check off your campaign promises on your white board, yeah, I read the book fear.  
yes Ted Bundy was convicted of killing 36 women. And he did so by going state to state and escaping from prison a few times. We should have border walls on state line.
no what about the kids that were killed by americans during mass shootings?
yes an Anerican shot up Vegas Strip smh
yes They have bought up an rented all the houses in every city and small town. The blacks an whites are out numbered, an they have Hispanic running for president already. What happened to the Alamo?
no When you said, "I believe Vladimir Putin" regarding the potential of North Korean missiles to hit the US, were you high or out of your mind? Benedict Donald needs to be arrested, interrogated and imprisoned ASAP!
yes Abdul Majid    Shes Legal, unlike YOU, Abdul !!
yes #NoBanNoWall
no Robert Dahlquist in some cases it can be much more. My previous job was a medical biller for a pediatric rehab where they offered speech, physical and occupation therapy. We had many patients that lived in Mexico come across every day to receive treatment that was covered by Medicaid. Basically it seems parents are having kids on this side of the border with no intention of living here, only to qualify their children for benefits. We billed over 40k a week. This particular clinic is closed now due to budget cuts, but this is going on all over.
yes Walls work throw da tards over with their buddys
yes What would u do
no No one talks about the money spent for land purchased by the prior administration for the border wall.

yes Yet one here will acknowledge how many times act of terrorism have happened on our own land by white males.
yes no they don't...
no Katie Hamilton Kramer that particular girl wouldnt be dead if her killer was in his own  country and had not broken the law by coming here illegally.
no If a wall could have stopped a death, can you imagine if no guns could stop all these senseless shootings?
no Tell that to the victims families of yesterday's mass shooting, dick head!
yes There are more important things to do in this country than build a fucking wall because that QUACK(Trump) wants to see how much power he has over the pocketbook of America, he better worry about those chains that they are gonna put on his fat ass and his kids when Mueller puts out his report showing that the entire family of hardened Criminals were Traitors to our country, their is way too much to do in this country than build a wall because Putin is making him do it, time for that QUACK to go, specifically speaking to Prison for the rest of his worthless life!!!
no Stupid orange fk.
no Walls didn't work, why are they around every Hollywood stars and politicians homes?
yes 110% I support the safety of all american..and those who live here legal  no matter who you are and where you came from. I came here as an immigrant,,in late 80's from the Philippines. I went and have my physical exam, i waited to call my name, the day I was suppose to have my interview, we had a typhoon, but that did not stop me from going to have my interview,, the point is,, if you wan't something really bad, you can do it no matter what how hard, and do it the RIGHT way, Legal Way. Now I am American Citizen,, I had to start all over again,, study, pay, apply, waiting to be call my name, I work hard and Pay my tax every day when i go buy something in the store, I pay tax and yearly. If I can do it, anyone can. But Do it Legal.. Illegal is wrong, Period!
yes Build the wall! Trump 2020!!!
no To keep Americans that are inside the womb safe we must complete the PP wall.
no A Christian man killed many people. Lets deport the Cristians!
yes Jail2020
no Anna Sophia Wheland I am sure you have decided to believe that not banning guns -and not having sensible, enforced gun laws either- would save more lives, but facts have already proven your belief to be wrong.
yes GOD S NOT HUMAN. How does he become a child ? Who created Mary. you don't think !!!            KURAN  CHAPTER 112 ihlas verses In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.         1  Say, "He is Allah, the One.       2  Allah, the Absolute.         3  He begets not, nor was He begotten.          4  And there is none comparable to Him."
no We are here supporting you !
yes Thank God for Trump !!
no Will Trump share the opinion pieces by the victims of Parkland or any other mass shooting?
no Kenny Shuster except that the boots on the ground at the border said they need it..
yes Randy Mac Tina King well then they can do that for the other ppl lol
no Stephen Mattison Now there's a mindless assertion....  Nice dream you must be living in.  Enjoy the delusion as long as you can....
no As we protect our country from people entering illegally,could we also raise the danger level of Mexico?   Our son was murdered there on vacation 3 months  ago.  The murder statistics are outrageous.   Statistics are higher each year.  There were 30,000 murders there in 2017 and 17,000 in US.  Mexico is 1/3 the size of US.   We need to investigate murders of our citizens in Mexico!
no the Arizona desert is a great pastime target practice patience a night scope and a great time feed the coyotes and buzzards love Arizona
yes Quran chapter 103 asr Time verses         In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.      1  By Time.         2  The human being is in loss.              3  Except those who believe, and do good works, and encourage truth, and recommend patience.
yes Build a multiple layer barrier from the Pacific to the Gulf shut them down

yes Sorry for your loss..  for your family
yes Built the wall, keep the illegals out.
no Politicians dont mind,not their kids,,
no We must have a Wall now
yes Obama started building the wall, democrats passed bills to pay for it, a lot of illegals were stopped but the wall needs finished.  The democrats don't want the wall now since a republican is in office.  They want the illegals here to vote.  Same reason they don't want voter ID.
yes Agree with you Mr President
no How about doing it the legal way  ?
yes If Pelosiphy has wall, why not the country? So, build that wall. God bless POTUS
no Laura Anglin Peterson  I'm so sick of liberal stupidity.  Crime is a state issue.  This is a federal issue since it has to do with illegal immigration.   Stop voting Democrat, and your state will fair better.  Also, go back to school and educate yourself on state and federal issues.  You must have skipped government classes.  You can't use national security crises on guns, because it's a protected right in the Constitution.   Obama used national emergency for Obamacare, and the courts said its unconstitutional.   Quit feeding your mind with liberal poison.
no President Trump wishes to protect Americans!  Democrats don't care about Americans, only votes.
no What about all the legal Americans that are running around killing people?
yes YOU are so full of crap
yes Shut your whore mouth.
yes BUILD THE WALL. BUILD THE WALL.
no mendoza out of the country
yes Just wished that bone spurs would show some concern about shool kids and others who are killed by born citizens who have killed huge nos. In the last three years. But Orange man never says a word about them. He only points out an immigrant on matters of people killed.
yes Tom Barker The most successful president in 32 years. Pres. Trump has done more in 2 years than Obama, Bush, Clinton. The best part???? Destroying Obama's legacy...
no The FOREIGN DOGS have to go, NOW !
no From  U yes!
yes I think illegal immigrants are the scourge of all our countries , whatever it takes to stop them going into other countries,
no Sum of the PRAISING COMMENTS ARE SO HILARIOUS  !!!!!!!!!!!!
no De Bolden ots HORRIBLE u just dont like that it's part of the problems this country has.  We have laws and I do support others who want to be a citizen of this country but do it LEGALLY!!!!   And u talk about privilege, no one has it anymore!!!!  This country will become France and I do hope all Liberals/Democrats love the 3rd world country u have made it out to be!!!!
yes White people kill folks all the damn time.  Thats your crisis. Stricter gun laws
no BUILD IT HIGH!!
no These people live in Iowa or Kentucky and they have no idea what goes on at the border.

yes Mention one mass shooting or school shooting by an immigrant?  The problem here is trump that is dividing USA with his hate on immigrants
no My thoughts and prayers go to all the families of those whos lives were taken by those here illegally. BUILD THAT WALL and keep America safe.
no Its been a crises for decades....and its about time we have a non-political hack with some balls to do what is right.
yes Sad losing child
no Tudy Anderson Latulip sad our president doesn't care about the Constitution.
yes Walls dont work have u heard of tunnels 20 feet under ground
no yes
no So very sad!
yes Maureen Hersey Brown .... Want to know why just look at the way trump's supporters berate and call Democrats and other political critics vile names (as trump does to his critics).  i have immigrants living in my neighborhood and they are way more decent than some of trump's that one sees in his posts.  Incidentally, I'm a proud Democrat and veteran who has served with others ... of both parties so you're slam is not only wrong it's not patriotism in any sense of the word.
no RED WRITTING LINES STILL SEE IT 30FOOT HIGH CLIMBED IT
yes Patsy,this is my reply to your earlier inquiry in part only, more very valid reasons exist also.
yes And most were registered Democrats let that sink in.
no Its good to know that banning immigrants will stop drunk driving.   I guess MADD spent money for decades for nothing.
yes This is why we need a wall. Here are some of the victims stories. Some of these people who are murdered were murdered by illegals who were previously deported. http://www.ojjpac.org/memorial.asp
yes James Ellis gun control
no So when white guys with guns walk into s school a shoot our kids by the dozens .. thats a not a problem but singular murders.... thats a national emergency?
yes Sorry for your loss.  There are many of us who stand behind Trump and the wall.  We must stop the illegal immigrant invasion.
yes I agree that illegal immigration is a problem.  Not enough for the wall though.  The bigger threat is all of the homegrown terrorists.  Shouldn't we focus on them first?
yes I'm disgusted with you r president. The bill you just signed guts ice and helps illegals  https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/02/15/trump-decries-catch-release-while-expanding-release-illegal-aliens/
no Im just here because Soros paid me to say no wall, crime dont stop with walls where do I get my $5 now
no God providence with brother Flag
yes All Lies
yes Grab it by the pussy
yes Fences make good neighbors
no Alberto Weisz exactly
yes Thanks President Trump
yes How many times have Progressives justified regulations on business and ignored the cost ...even if it only saved one life... Now the deny the most important function of the Federal Government, defense of the country, which is killing more people and doing more damage than all of the "safety measures"that they are forcing on us. Wake up! They want power & control  through centralized government by bureaucracy doing there will.
yes Yes sir! You are only doing your job for which the liberals are persecuting you! Never in my life in my 71 years in my country have I seen such hatred, corruption and deception. God bless you Pres. Trump! Now you need to get all the families that have suffered the loss of their loved ones and have a conference on TV with them. I mean all of them and there are a lot!
yes I would love to see a program like 60 minutes take a camera crew to the towns along the Mexican, US Border and hold town meetings to get the residents opinions about the wall, screw all these people who live far enough from the Border that their not really effected !
yes How is this even a debate for scumbags like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Senator Chuck Schumer and the rest of Democratic Klan?
yes Danny, the perp you cite is unfortunately one of us and we are left to deal with these kinds of things as a community through legal channels. The perp who took this mans daughter should never have been here and, given serious, intellectually honest and bipartisan action to secure our border bring sanity back to our immigration enforcement process, likely would not have removed her from our midst.   Sorry for your loss.
yes There are federal codes that allow him to protect the homeland.
no Amen! With you all the way! Answered the call on 9/11. Son answered it as well as a US Marine and still proudly served YOU and all of us!
no So true England is looking like Pakistan. Sad!
no God bless you and your family.My deepest condolances.
yes Fear mongering
yes people in united kingdom just  giving up on British government to do their jobs they care more about   approval ratings and deporting illegal immigrant isn't on the list.
yes Everyone is warning that the Democrats will use national emergency in the future! BIG HAIRY DEAL!  When have the democrats ABIDED BY THE CONSTITUTION in the last 12 years? NEVER!  BUILD THE WALL!
yes https://scfop3.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bf877da9cc2bde14d3f4f10e4d2e038f.jpg
yes We need the wall to be safe from outside, okay, but how can we be safe from inside with these stupid gun laws...
no I'm so sorry for your loss however more kids get killed in this country by American citizens. The immigrants aren't the problem, the guns are.

yes Walls and Laws! Keeping building the wall and uphold the law!
no So sad that we let this happen.
yes "I dont care. I believe Putin." Are u fucking kidding me?!?! #Traitor #PutinPuppet #BenedictDonald #Individual1 #ITMFA
yes Finish the wall secure our Southern border
yes Here's a true story and a very sad one at that.  A few years ago in my city, a young mother was viciously gunned down by her own father who had snuck back into this country after already being deported.  He snuck in and killed his own daughter all because he felt disrespected because she was dating an older man.  So yeah, I'm all for the wall.
no zgn Sere Ergr yes.. ask the Chinese Korean Vietnamese an others that ares ..   What happens whit ISIS crossed from Canada borderline
yes Vets before wall.
yes Then deport all of the insurgents currently sitting in detention. Sweep the American Southwest house by house and remove them all.
yes Build the wall! Prayers for all!

yes BUILD THE WALL TRUMP 2020
yes Dennis J Sitko theyre our citizens and they will be punished. We dont need criminals from other countries.
no Gabriel Anibal Toribio i saw 3 posts today of illegals killing anericans...i didnt bother tagging you..
no Luis Zepeda-Hernandez
no Mass shootings by domestic white male terrorists is the National Emergency in this country, but it's all crickets from  the Orange Turd and his ignorant gullible supporters.
no Im sick of this lunatic using families like its a parade... Sickening.
yes build the darn wall...
yes YES INDEED WE DO

no We have enough homelessness, drugs, crime, disease.  We need to solve these problems.  Build the wall!
no whats GROTESQUE is your opinion...but thats your right
yes Quit using fear tactics to scare your base. Pathetic wreck.
yes We must have the WALL
yes Gun control is more important, DOTARD
no One of my good friends was killed by a guy whose surname was Wall
yes It seems to be your only priority.  Hate wont bring them back. Guns in the hands of Americans kill more people than undocumented immigrants. That is our national emergency.
no Dylan Shaw so how many come in undetected?  No way to get accurate numbers.
yes https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/have-undocumented-killed-63000-us-9-11/      https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/03/us/immigrants-crime-numbers/index.html     [The majority of mass shooters have been far right politically and American citizen nationally from the beginning of the Trump administration] https://www.vox.com/a/mass-shootings-america-sandy-hook-gun-violence
no Keep up the great work Trump!
yes So many sheeps in this post
yes A+
no Keep us safe !!  Let the left howl, moan, and threaten. They are mad because you are getting your hands on their money their greedy hands won't get.
no Of  Course  we  do  !!!
yes You distort the risks as you exploit personal tragedy, all because your position 'Tests well'. History will judge you harshly.
yes The Great Wall of China, is a model to us with many lesson; including the story of the King of China who  had a kite maker killed and his kite burned, so that no one would ever fly over THE WALL !  ...there are more important problems in America and a Wall is not really going to help much !
no https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/media-releases/all
yes When I post on here !! I hope im giving you good advice. If you want to end this Socialist calling card. That the Democrats are using as a tactic.They want to attract people who are living paycheck to paycheck. You have a history of renting properties. Affordable housing is a major problem. It is swinging hard working Americans to the left. You could ruin this for Nancy and her crew. You could be the champion of the working poor. You need to start a program to subsidize rent based on income. You could fund it by putting a small tax on All rental properties and corperations, sales tax ect. I think this country would be behind you on this 100%. Id be glad to add one dollar to my monthly rent to pay for this. So would big corperations. Why ?? because it would help everyone to have a nice place to call home. It also could be used to provide housing for the chronic homeless people and vets. The Dems have painted you as this rich arrogant monster. This could be applied to home buyers also. You are a great leader. Show the American people how great a leader Donald J. Trump can be ~~ God Bless
no That's not the point ass clown. Can't stop it all but we can protect our border as a preventative measure. Get a clue puppet
no Right. But if a cop uses excessive force and kills an unarmed civilian, he's just "one bad apple" and not exemplary of all cops. Statistically, undocumented immigrants commit fewer crimes. For an obvious reason: they want to keep a low profile.
yes Only a coward will use those unfortunately events for a political game, a coward and a traitor!!
no Youre a Moran president Trump!!! YOU are the National emergency! Impeach Trump now! Stupid narcissist
yes 100 victims die from gun violence every day in America. THAT'S an emergency.
yes FINISH THE WALL
yes we'll save you some crumbs
yes Trump is doing what no president would of done!
no I'm so sorry for your loss Mr Ferguson I cannot  imagine  losing my daughter. But  I Iost my cousin on September 11th at the world trade center by terrorists. It's just not Mexicans that are coming here illegally it's other illegals  aswell from other countries. We need the wall built it's a loophole for anyone that wants to come to our country we need all the Mexicans and illegal immigrants to go back to their own country and  if they want to come here they have to do it legally bottom line
yes Yes everyone knows that..has nothing to do with disliking immigrants..it's the ILLEGAL one's..do the proper process and there is no issue at all
no Best President in my life time. Trump, 2020.
yes Matt Burdeno
yes My heart is broken for you. It is past time to have this issue addressed and the criminals handled and our American laws enforced!
no BUILD THE WALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yes hi
no Fact: Those in the Trump administration commit crimes at a higher rate than illegal immigrants.
yes BLOOD BART LINES NO NO
no ll that money Obama sent to Iran could have payed for the wall . And the money was already aproved years ago and where did it go.
yes Why doesnt he ever post articles about all of the victims of gun violence by white men?
yes What kills me is most of these morons live in a gated apartment or neighborhoods that say walls don't work
no An illegal killed my nephew, a young dedicated police officer. Shot him during a traffic stop! Walls that are dug in deep and built very high will save lives, no question!
no Many more lives have been killed by American white males in mass shootings than by illegal immigrants. If you would have declared a national emergency on the gun violence we would stand with you because that is a true national emergency.
no Electrify the wall
no How sick Pepe are to try to make excuses for a wall
yes Diana Klausner theyre standing up to the good old boys club and established oligarchy, they hate when the status quo is upset!
yes Some of the points on here are good ones. But the big point that some don't want to see. If we was not spending billions and billions a year on illegals. That would be money that could be used to help people with medical issues. Help vets. Help the homeless. We are spending billions a year on people who have not brought so much as a soda pop In this country. As for the water in Michigan. It was a problem long before trump was elected. If the voters in Michigan would quit voting the same people in that got them in this mess. Just maybe things would get fixed. Your water problems are controlled by your local government not the president.
yes De Bolden where was the shooting?
yes Trump hires undocumented workers? Just five of the 565 companies in President Trumps business empire are signed up to use E-Verify, the governments best tool to weed illegal immigrants out of the workforce, according to a Washington Times analysis that suggests the president could personally be doing more on that front. Mr. Trumps golf courses in Charlotte, Los Angeles and Miami, his hotel in Washington, D.C., and a hotel he operated in New York are signed up. But his marquee Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida is not signed up, nor are his golf courses in Virginia, Philadelphia or Bedminster, New Jersey  where, The New York Times reported Thursday, some illegal immigrants have been working for years. One of them, Victorina Morales, a Guatemalan woman who jumped the border in 1999, has been at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster for more than five years, making Mr. Trumps bed, cleaning his toilet and dusting his golf trophies, the newspaper reported.

yes Affffff he still playing this game and the trump-zombies are oh yeahhh... Jesus, year by year guns are killing innocent pple and Americans (not only in North America but in the whole north, centre and south... all sent from U.S.A.) more pple are dying from guns from America than casual accidents where unfortunately people had their faith to cross with, which involves anyone that comes from other countries trying a better life in U.S. - but yeah lets talk about people from other countries coming over U.S. because that sounds legit instead of the real problems you guys are facing ... are you guys drinking the kool-aid or what ?! (Everyone remembers how the kool-aid pple died right??!) stop being fool ! He is the only one killing Americans and everyone elses while making profits on the top of it! ... and Trump-zombies are applauding believing every kind of nonsense - what a clueless nation!
no How many kids are killed from school shootings? How many people die from poverty and not being able to afford their medicine? Didn't 16000 veterans kill themselves this year?? But yes the Mexicans are our country's main concern. Idiots.
yes Hameedullah Safi my dude you can't even spell dealers correctly that wall gonna fall over
yes I want to fucc ya daughter ivanka  I will need a lot of condoms  That is protection
no Donny trump the one hit wonder
yes Michael Collins if a 1000 of those stories came out a week would u change your mind??  You dont hear them because they are not allowed to report it was an illegal responsible for traffic fatalities. Where I am we have had 3 cases this week, and I am not in a high immigrant area.
yes Resign, you fat fucking criminal.
yes Ed Wrany does making me cringe every time he opens his moronic conman mouth qualify as hurting my feelings?
yes sorry about your daughter and i agree the wall must be built
no Michaelsummers
yes Zdenka Udovicic  what is the problem with my statement? It is a fact followed by an ironic question. Maybe your English isnt good enough to understand the point of what I wrote?
yes How do I sue the State of Calif for endangering me?
yes Wow she was so beautiful this needs to stop!
no Just sent this to Kamala Harris, who calls for gun control because a kid was shot by an American criminal  and open borders at the same time.  #Detestable
yes BUILD THAT WALL then throw  all the democrats over it !
no Dallas Woody Coerced? It's a representative of the United Kingdom proposing the idea! Where do I sign?
yes This is disgusting abuse of facts. Illegal immigrants have lower crime rates than Americans. To single out specific cases, is pure manipulation.
yes Trump is killing America. No wall!
no Kristen Scarbrough it's not just one person it's millions.
no Democrats want open borders, just check out all the murders in Mexico. 5 people just got murdered at a resort in Cancun
yes Thank you, President Trump!    Keep fighting!  We are still behind you & your base is growing!
yes we do...60,000 illegal  entries a month....turned loose into our country awaiting a hearing that only 2-4% show up for...our american citizens aren't afforded that right
no Eva Graham bella fucking Pelosi
yes 45 is a sick psycho who is a malignant narcissist,  mysogynist,  child raper!!!
yes The true enemy of the people is the state.  We'll never defeat our oppressors divided.  Police are the protectors of the elite rich top 1 percent.  Bankers bought their power over the us government when they established the federal reserve.  We're tricked into hating each other for skin color,religion differences,  and political views.   Statism is slavery  Taxation is theft  We're all servants to the state.  The government is our God.  Try to opt out of paying taxes,or a traffic ticket.  Everything is enforced by state violence via cops.
no I WANNA SEE ALL YOUR GRERN CARDS NOW
yes Bull$hit! Trump doesnt care about anything but his own sorry, fat a$$! Nothing worth believing coming from this moron!
no Yes and yes
yes Tudy you beat me to it. You're exactly right. We have enough criminals, we don't need any more.
no Secure the border stop the madness. "Finish the wall." it is a crisis and definitely ," National Emergency." God bless the only man in D.C. who cares, My President Donald J. Trump, voted for you and nothing will stop us from voting for you again, We humbly give you our vote , as it is all we can give. God speed good man.
yes Trump supporter's=666
yes Build that wall and let the Socialist Democrats FALL
no Okay you got one illegal immigrant against 20 homegrown American terrorists how is the wall going on protect you
yes Jennifer Luthye thats the same thing. And is not what I said. I do not believe using immigration status as a reason someone would have lived or died.
yes Five people died yesterday because a man got a gun legally that wasnt supposed to have it.Fake president fake crisis

yes The 80s called and they want your hairdo back..
yes But we also need protection from our govt.
yes Mr. President,
yes Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher.
yes How many have been killed by white right wing terrorists?
yes It is our constitutional right to be safe even against our own government. Build, build, build. Thank you for all you are doing President Trump! Trump for 2020
yes BITCH let's not forget what your own Government did to Paradise
no Tony Connelly how many die from drug OD from drugs smuggled across the southern border?
yes *are*
yes Ill bet that Nobel Prize will look great on the mantle under the stuffed elephant head, next to the economy bucket from KFC.
yes This is HORRIBLE that our President would share something like this. Smh from a drunk driving accident? Come on now...this is SO DIRTY! That white kid in TX that killed a whole family didnt even get any jail time because of his privilege. But u wanna use this as a platform for billions of dollars for a wall??? GTFOH!
yes An illegal alien driving a loaded simi ass-ended a line of cars stopped at a road repair who were waiting on the pilot car to get through. The older couple in the last car in line was smashed into a pickup. The pickup smashed into the back of a loaded cattle trailer and was deflected into the ditch. The older couples car was then smashed flat between the oncoming simi and the stopped simi and were killed instantly. The truck driver was an illegal and was burned in the crash. He was taken into custody and transported to OKC for treatment. There was never any news of what was done with him but I imagine he was released and hauled ass for Mexico leaving Americans with the medical bills and funeral expenses.
yes Daniel Antonio Thomas  well how does that stand for crime committed by Your own people? Pearl Brown Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR
yes Do you think that a fucking wall can protect you. I think that it is not a solution
no Let's not hate people who don't look like us!
no Wall now
no I can't help but wonder what the  parents, siblings, friends, or even the victims themselves,  that were killed or knew someone killed by an illegal, feelings were on illegals and Sanctuary cities prior to these tragic events.
yes Stand firm President TRUMP We are with you - God speed  #Trump2020  #BuildTheWall

yes Los  Angeles Times  03/04/2008  ""Stanford University called about Jamiel Shaw a week or so ago, intrigued by the slight but speedy running back for Los Angeles High School, the Southern League's most valuable player last year. Rutgers University called a few days later. The Shaw family already had reason to be proud. Jamiel's mother, Army Sgt. Anita Shaw, was on her second tour of duty in Iraq. On Sunday night, it was Jamiel's father on the phone and then his son's girlfriend, Chrystale Miles. Jamiel Sr. called to tell him to hurry home from the mall. The 17-year-old boy was three doors away when someone (Pedro Espinoza ) shot him to death while he was still talking on his cellphone to Chrystale,  Jamiel Sr. heard the shots almost as soon as he hung up. He ran out of the house, raced around the corner and found his son lying on the sidewalk, bleeding."  "Los Angeles police officials described the killing as random and senseless, cutting down a youth who had been doing everything right in his life -- from hitting the books to never missing church to inspiring the Los Angeles High Romans to last year's Southern League title. A police spokeswoman said two Latino men pulled up in a car, jumped out, asked Jamiel if he belonged to a gang, and shot him when he didn't answer. She said Jamiel was not affiliated with a gang". "The youth's football coach, Hardy Williams, was with the family Monday at their 5th Avenue home, where Jamiel's trophies and medals lined the mantel. His 9-year-old brother, Thomas, wore Jamiel's favorite Atlanta Braves cap. Tears flowed. "He was a very special kid," Williams said. "Not only was he an outstanding athlete, he was a good person. I've never seen Jamiel mad. He had such a big smile." The coach described his standout player as "a Houdini on the football field," and the numbers backed it up. As a junior, Jamiel rushed for more than 1,000 yards last year, averaging just over 14 yards per carry. An invitational All-City first-team selection, he scored 11 touchdowns, returned punts and kickoffs, and played defensive back. He also competed in track. Hours before he was shot, Jamiel had spent the day at a football camp at Pasadena City College, Williams said. "Stanford just called me about his transcripts," he said. "Rutgers called a couple of days ago. He was just on track. . . . He was very elated." He is not elated anymore. He is dead. Rotting under six feet of dirt, Donald Trump is his only voice. He speaks for the Dead.
no Build the Wall! Enought is enought.
yes Bahahaha!! Yeah, that's why the dumbass Chicago mayor wants it to be a sanctuary city!

no http://www.etimaden.gov.tr/en
yes BUILD THAT WALL !!!!
no An American killed 5 people yesterday. Wheres your outrage?
yes Danny Jones  Quote Great British culture. I'm a Brit. The EU hate us. End of. So I'd rather we gave the USA 5 billion as a gift for the wall rather than give 39 billion a year to the EU ...  You havent really answered any questions - just added more illiterate drivel.  What is your view of the great British culture and how has EU membership eroded it?  Do answer with specifics if you can. Why do you think the EU hate us? They certainly dont want us to leave but theyre not going to compromise their membership tenets to suit the U.K. - we already have a good deal. How would gifting 5billion to the US benefit the U.K. as much as membership to the EU has?  I doubt youll be able or willing to answer any of the above - just like Trump supporters, youre not that bright and completely misinformed.  Twats like you shouldnt have the vote.
no The wall yes
no Kenzie Kawamura  Democrats do not want to send them back.  There will be several steps in this progress.
no It was the largest cocaine bust in 25 years at California's Port Hueneme.  More than 200 pounds of cocaine were found hidden on two ships.  The feds announced the bust on the same day Donald Trump said drugs don't come through ports of entry.
no Build Wall!!!!!!
no And run an electric cable across the top........
yes Ummmm......y'all do know that MOST illegals are people who overstayed their visas, right?  What is the wall supposed to do again? Ya know, with them already here? 
yes 100% truth

yes Comrade stooge motherfucka individual 1 made the greatest declaration of a national emergency in American history the emergency at the southern border is way more serious than the 911 attacks and if anyone says otherwise just ask the angel dads and moms #TFA #GoBackToRussiaTraitor #HateHasNoHomeHere
yes So sad!!  We must work to stop this!!  The wall will help!!!
yes What's even more amazing is that White mass shooters kill more innocent people, yet Trump won't ever talk about em why?? If Trump does all of a sudden it's a "mental illness" is it a mental illness if an illegal does it??
no Ahmad Mahmoud it is not a beauty pageant.  Trump is doing what he was elected to do.
no Ib
yes "Someone was killed by a gun,  so we should ban guns" That's how dumb this is
yes Diana Klausner is not just ignorant but stupid too
yes More people are killed by American citizens than immigrants,the wall is pointless
no Youre a garbage person.
yes Wendi DelValle liar.
no More people in the US die at the hands of American citizens. Protect that !
yes why build a wall that can be tunneled under . makes no sense to me...
yes God bless you, President Trump, for ALL you do for us. I pray for you and your family and those working to help you save our wonderful, free country every day. You are doing a phenomenal job under idiotically difficult circumstances!!!   
yes Many, one could say it's the addicts fault but I wouldn't. The facts are 90% of herion come across the southern border.
yes Need To Impeach
yes Bbuild now
no We are so sorry for your loss and totally agree with you and President Trump that there IS A CRISIS at the border and the wall in the right places can help keep all Americans and their children safer!
no Any chance you can come over here Donald and build a wall right around our little London bubble?
yes https://www.dps.texas.gov/administration/crime_records/pages...dps.texas.gov
no Sad and sorry for their lost...pero no te agas pendejo Trump, what about all the undocumented human beings here in the U.S. that also have saved American lives..you know the storys are out there...
no Wendi DelValle sounds like guns in the wrong hands is the issue, not walls.   5 Americans shot and killed at their job, by another American.
no An illegal killed my cousin husband .
yes Stricter gun laws will protect Americans walls will not help the crime problem
yes Get rid of the white male gun toting Christians and well all be much safer.
yes One death of any American by an illegal is 100% one too many. It should be ZERO! These Americans should be alive today. Once again Democrats have blood on their hands. If they arent murdering full term babies they are leaving us wide open for the taking! Build the Wall! Stop these Democrats and their Anti American Agenda!
no https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/votes-put-emergency-termination-trumps-desk-sen-tammy/story?id=61122331&cid=social_fb_abcn&fbclid=IwAR0-VC36RbC2d42UWj8-aVKWVAFXto4n83xVsVNx7s6YIHcq7zy-IUF4wng . ..
yes We have 535 politicians that need be deceased.
no Better if people who are descendants of other countries leave American just for the native people of America( The native Americans) and go to their country.  America will be peaceful.
yes trumpery /trmp()r/  noun 1.  attractive articles of little value or use. synonyms:	trinkets, baubles, cheap finery, knickknacks, ornaments, bibelots, gewgaws, gimcracks "tables piled with all sorts of trumpery" adjective 1. showy but worthless.
yes What about school shooting? Those are immigrants as well?

no Build that Wall Mr President
yes BUILD THE WALL AND MORE LAW AND ORDER,
no WALL!
no The wall is a way to nip it in the bud. If stopped at the border, the pos liberal democrat so called leaders of ours can't have a chance to give them our tax dollars. No illegal deserves the first free thing from the American government. That's just the most obvious reason. There are several.
yes Pam Tigert Me too
no Bull O'Neill The Military Doesnt Seem to Appreciate Trumps Border Stunt                                                                       President Trumps decision to deploy thousands of active-duty soldiers to the border with Mexico, ostensibly to defend against an invasion of asylum seekers from Central America, is such a transparent political stunt that even his fellow Republicans are dismayed  if only because they think its a less effective midterms strategy than focusing on the midterms. As it turns out, another group you might generally expect to support the president is also less than thrilled with his order: namely, the military itself.  Responding to criticism of the dubious deployment last week, Defense Secretary James Mattis demurred: We dont do stunts in this department. The soldiers being sent to the border are there to provide support to the Department of Homeland Security, just as they often do after natural disasters, Mattis insisted. The secretary did not speak to the question of whether a dwindling caravan of around 3,000 Central American asylum seekers, currently 800 miles from the border and traveling on foot, really merited the same emergency response as a hurricane.  Since then, several reports have come out showing that Trumps original vision for the deployment, tendentiously titled Operation Faithful Patriot, was larger in scope than what the Pentagon ultimately allowed, as some of what the president expected the soldiers to do was at best wasteful and at worst illegal. The administrations first request, CNN reported on Friday, was for soldiers to provide crowd and traffic control and protect Customs and Border Protection personnel, which some Defense officials viewed as law enforcement activities the military is barred by law from performing. That request was rejected, as was a proposal that soldiers construct housing for detained migrants, according to Reuters.
yes Sorry for your loss, but Trump is not the answer.
no GREATEST PRESIDENT EVER!  THE ALMIGHTY GOD IS WITH YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP AMEN! ! ! !
yes Waste of a life... how many more die while Dems debate... blood on their hands

HOWEVER, SO MANY HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS THAT YOU MIGHT WANT A CENSUS . MANY MANY MORE THEN KNOWN ! WALLS SAVE LIVES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE WALL!  #BUILDTHEWALL ! #MAGA  :)!
no I was in your corner for a LONG time, President Trump. But, I'm starting to feel like you are just jerking us around. Best get it in gear and start getting that wall together QUICKLY.
no Curtis Rice OMG! Your attempt at humor has literally BLOWN MY MIND
yes Yeah, no bias there...
no Jones Jebaraj The Australians, Italians , Indians, or people who are descendants of any other country must go back leaving America to be a better people for the native American tribes.
yes How is golfing every other day working hard?
no Apple Rivera God bless you Apple

no I support president trump 100 % and will be voting straight red 2020 if you don't like my post troll your azz on
yes Link Lindquist this post is not about immigrants, its about illegal aliens
yes I guess some Americans don't care about the wall until it hits home and kills one of there own family members if your a United States citizen you should demand the wall.
no Dems care more about Illegals than US Citizens, only hope for new voters for them!
no Shaun Davis Kirk Davis

yes Ok well how about the wall that cuts the INC for child tax credit off at 47000 be moved to 100,000 so the  middle class  can get some of their taxes back at the beginning of the year ! I bet a lot of us would vote for a wall hell I bet some of us would change voter status js 
yes Keith Webber Jr. same bot post over and over

Anyone  that  has  a  LOVE  for  America  ,  would  see  that  it  is   necessary   for  protection    from   the  unwanted   Illegals   and   drugs
no It needs done
yes Curtis Treat thats terrible!!
yes google The Great Wall of China - did it keep out the Mongolians, no.  hahahahahaha
yes Joe Jimenez And a black guy killed how many yester at his job? Just trying to point out what a total idiot you truly are in life! You don't have any friends at all huh?I wonder why? Freaking loser!
yes Cheating betraying manipulating Gaslighting assholes
yes So if he had traveled here legally, drank a bunch of beers, ran two red lights, and hit his daughter...she would still be alive? Do beers make you more drunk if your an illegal immigrant?  Trying to find the correlation to his status as an illegal immigrant and her dying due to blunt force trauma from being hit by a car.  Do we know that this guy didnt come legally and just stay longer than his visa allowed and that is how he became an illegal immigrant? How would a wall have stopped that?
no Thank you for having the courage to safeguard our USA from the invasion of all these countries and how think they can just illegally cross our border.
yes BUILD THE WALL> 100%
yes Now Is too late.  ///:
no What do you mean?
yes Build a 30 wall. Theyll build a 35 ladder. Bury the wall 30. Theyll dig a 35 deep tunnel. This is what a Hispanic man said.
yes If these democrats that are against bullding the wall ,have never had any thing to happen to their families, if something was to happen to them you could hear them all the way to Washington ,wanting something done for protection.
no Propaganda at its finest
no They dont belong in our fucking country period.
yes What about all the white nationalist shootings in the past couple years? Fuckin idiots...
yes sure, but a person illegally here that should not have a license?
no How many people died from prescribed medicines? Gun accidents? Vehicle accidents? Spousal abuse? Gang violence? Mental illness? Why are you picking on these families who are just trying to survive when home grown Americans are slaughtering each other and themselves daily?
yes We are withYou, Mr President Donald J. Trump, All ways and Always...
yes However the crime rate is lower by illegal immigrants than by legal citizens.
yes What about husbands who beat their wives? Should they be in the White Houseyou filthy piece of trash.
yes You can not blame EVERY illegal immigrant for your loss...NO WALL
no Lol, go away you fucking idiot and take your red neck inbred supporters with you
no The President is a member of ms13
yes Build the fricken wall
no It is time to wake up California and America and Stop voting for The lying hypocrite communist socialist liberals democrats that are destroying this country. We must put America First. WE MUST BUILD THE WALL
yes Agreed
yes And  somehow,,,the sleazy selfish Democrats like Waters...with her big mouth..seem to not give a damn about these poor people.
yes U covered up the rape of a 4 year old girl by officer Jose Nunez. U covered up the rape of a 4 year old girl. U protected a child molester. All u care about is money. U say and do anything as long as it fits your agenda.  #TrumpIsABitch
no For  your vanity wall: Sending thoughts and prayers.                            A white American male shot and killed five people and injured many law enforcement yesterday in Pence's Indiana. WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT THAT??
yes Funny how all the mass shootings are done by white people ,but you think the danger comes from across the border idiots.
yes This is deeply troubled, but if you only blame immigrants for killing people, you should put even more priority on banning the huge mountain of weapons in your country.  Is it an idea that the arms manufacturers and their factories are being converted into rescue companies that are ready to help people around the world instead of supplying weapons so that they break each other apart. There must be better business models than earning money by causing death. One must be the first, America can make a big revolution so that people get air and can build a life.  With a better life, the need to emigrate also lapses. A win-win situation ..
yes So what's the problem completing the border wall? Most if not all of us have some walls around our homes. If they are not complete then anyone can get into our backyard and break in right? It's really common sense folks. It's not we are wasting 5.75 Billion but just enough to finish building the border walls.
no Patty Bertocchini La Puma you people just dont get it we dont want the illegal immigrants here period.  I dont care if they kill people or dont if they ride around on your democratic unicorns and spread love lol they dont belong here BUILD A GIANT WALL ha ha not sure why the Democrats are so against securing our boarders oh I know because then they'd have nobody to vote democratic ha ha not sure how you people are going to handle 6 more years of TRUMP
no President Trump, I want to travel to America

yes Sorry for you loss. Illegals should be deported immediately.
no President Trump may I suggest you coming to the national farm machinery tractor pull next year
yes oh! is this the best movie of 2020
no #TeamBuildTheWall
no Why do demos  give no credence to our America children. It just astonishing that they dont give a damn about us & only want to Let in illegals. It must be all about votes. Vets homeless on streets that just ignore us & making Americans second on list. Vote red and remember what they are doing. Cant get away with anything unless we vote them out.
yes ONE more of American life lost is already enough... UNACCEPTABLE Stop the genocide of our people.
yes EL chapo schould pay for the wall..
yes You'll get it done. I'm pulling for you, and I'm also going to vote for you in 2020. Keep up the great work, and God bless you and your family, Mr. President!
yes You need to put some ointment on that burnt ego
yes it'd be easier to just get rid of you
no The democrats dont care
no Exploiting a person's death for political gain- is there anything lower? What an incredible scumbag Trump is.
yes Trump's main point of being elected and if elected by the people of United States of America was to build a wall he got elected, hes gonna build the wall! That's what the people who voted him in want!!  It is in no way what's in "HIS" best interests, it's what's in the best interests of the "people" who voted him in! Also - allowing ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION is not in in the constitution, trust me I checked twice. So he's not subverting the constitution in any way.... just saying
no God bless President Trump. We the people love you and will vote for you again in 2020 !!! MAGA TRUMP 2020
no the congress woman(although she wants to be called the democrat socialist) needs to go!
no They murdered my beautiful granddaughter s father
yes Man...... let it go dude
yes Taylor Embree, killed by a three time deported illegal DUI convict; Bakersfield, CA.   This bullshit has to stop.  The American people have had enough.
yes Build a better judicial system. 40 yrs for selling pot? A slap on the fanny and some cool zip tie cuffs for jumping the border? Sarry....biff law
yes Sad day. Borders open. Amnesty. Dems destroy GOP.  NEW SURGE WILL COME. You need to step up your game... https://www.facebook.com/DMLNewsApp/videos/344302992850242/
yes James Ellis thank you Mr no profile
yes Oh, well if that happened once then Im convinced.  Its s national emergency. 
yes Jess Castrejn yeah its honestly sad that hes allowing his daughters death to be used in propaganda like this.
yes Sharon Fantana what prevents me from walking into your house?
no THE BORDER WALL DOESN'T KEEP OUT CRIMINALS. Do you HONESTLY THINK the criminal stands in line, patiently waiting - for DAYS - to get through a legal entry point? Even YOU cannot be THAT STUPID.
yes Walls with remote machine gun turrets work better!
no How about gifting that 5bn to the NHS, you Brexiter muppet coward?
yes White supremacist and other far-right extremist groups have killed 51 police officers since 1990, according to a report published by the Anti-Defamation League last week. Left-wing extremist groups, including black nationalists, killed 11 during the same period.  In 2017 alone, black nationalists and other leftists killed no police, while white supremacists and anti-government extremists fatally attacked a police officer and two corrections officers, the report said.  But while the FBI tracks so-called black identity extremists as domestic terror threats  as an FBI counterterrorism report completed in August and leaked in October revealed it doesnt have an equivalent designation for white extremists.  Experts worry that the broad labeling of black groups, and not white ones, is an indication that federal law enforcements targeting of certain groups is based less on evidence than on politics.  https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article196423174.html
yes mass shootings by white me is the real emergency but nothing is done to stop it.
no My fear is not the defeat of stupidity on the left, the American people see thru the lies.  My biggest fear is weakness from the right, its so hard to defend the party that wont even try.  Trump 2020 without fail
yes Laura Calderwood hated the sound of her daughter's name  Mollie Tibbetts  coming from Pres. Trump's mouth as he sought to use her death to drum up anti-immigrant sentiment.  Laura is living her rebuttal: She has taken in a teen named Ulises, the son of 2 immigrants who were forced to flee the community when an anti-immigrant backlash drove out many who worked at the same farm as Mollies alleged killer.
yes A wall will not stop drugs and illegals, but it is a place to start.  When you want to fix a problem, start with the first step.  Build a wall.
yes or just walk across because of the lack of other security measures...build the wall
yes Don't forget the millions of displaced American workers due to the foreigner invasion.
no Tell Congress Trump is coming and Americans are coming with him...MAGA...FINISH THE WALL...
yes When it finally happens to the DEMS families, then they will realize how ignorant they are for not wanting the borders safe.
no So do guns
yes  Were gonna build a wall!    And military families in need of housing, disaster victims and people suffering from the opioid epidemic are gonna pay for it! 
no Don Rosenbaum
yes Just like 144 police officers killed last year 1 by a undocumented immigrant
no Let's get it built <3
yes We have 30 million illegals here now, when will it be to much?   Stupidity is watching the problem grow and ignoring it.
yes Diane Edwards Linton so the gun walks up to people and shoot themselves?
yes Did you hear about Aurora illinois shooting yesterday asshole? Guess what, he was legal and with a felony and somehow he bought a gun.  How your stupid wall is going to solve that ?
no What about all the legals here who commit mass killings? Should we build a wall to keep them in?
no Deborah Bartlett no it wasn't. The initial package included a 19th century wall with no technology being used. Geez, don't you people ever pay attention?
no Dave David Let's get rid of every brain dead liberal, starting with you!
yes Progressive loons could careless. All they want are votes. Btw this a manufactured crisis. Only its by the globalist and supporters of the. NWO.
yes An illegal alien bastard murdered my godson.  May all MS-13 animals rot in hell.  I stand with the President.  BUILD THE WALL...and crime will fall.
no The democrats and whosoever wanna have humanity and pity for these illegal immigrants please post your Name, address and phone number so that illegal immigrants can come to you! Because of that, you can practice what you call humanity and pity on them!
yes This wall is not necessary! Trump said that it is not an emergency!!!! He just needs to satisfy his nit wit base or he is TOAST!
yes Cindy Sak Nowak obviously your comprehensive skills are based on Fictional world's where the same cops that you idiots are calling oppressors and murderers all of a sudden become your protectors when law abiding citizens have no guns. Get a clue
yes In Germany dies people about illegal immigrants too.
yes Protecting Americans when u r threatening to release 800 isis fighters? So our children (not yours of course) fought and died for what? And those left To live and fight these guys again?  ISIS-controlled territory is shrinking in Syria, and President Trump is declaring a military victory over the terrorist group. But there is another front growing in West Africa.
no More Americans are killed by Americans than come over the boarder
yes Emily Neal new laws will not stop a criminal from getting a gun.
no bunkum.
yes THAT WONT STOP PEOPLE FROM GETTING KILLED - JUST 5 PEOPLE GOT KILLED YESTERDAY - DON'T SEE YOU GOING ON ABOUT THAT.
yes An illegal immigrant cut my lawn we dont need a wall
yes Chenier--This is just one case out of thousands every year. The liberal democrat media refuses to report on them, because it doesn't help their agenda for open border's. The point is, that these illegal's weren't suppose to be here & each case would have been one "less case" of a family losing a loved one to murder, or a killing by a drunk driving illegal.
no https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Las_Vegas_shooting
no https://www.facebook.com/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneWild/photos/a.506655886092108/2136549723102708/?type=3&theater&ifg=1
yes Look it up the judge said that because he came from a privaledged family he would not have to go to jail....for killing an ENTIRE family in a drunk driving incident. Im not gonna do ur research for u.

yes Walls work 100%
yes round up all the illegal Aliens and detain the ones who allowed them to enter and stay.
no How.many children have been murdered by American citizens? 1200 last year killed by guns. That is a real crisis.
yes THE RIGGED AND CORRUPT PRESIDENT IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE
no So sad .
yes My 18 year brother was killed by an illegal immigrant in 2005 who was high on drugs and drunk,  he is still in prison to this day in United States.  2020 he will be released back to Mexico. I support the wall 100%  No wall will bring my brother back but maybe save someone else's brother or sister 
yes The MSM doesn't report the news any more but years ago the Mexican president released all his criminals from prisons so long as they left the country and went to America.  That explains illegal aliens of Mexico and crime.
yes Well a white guy killed my relatives.
no I know!
no Yes it will
yes Spreading fears. Wow, how stupid you all are. We do have Americans who kill other Americans too! Quacking, quacking, and quacking.

She was stabbed several times outside in front of her aunt's house she went into the house collapsed on the floor bleeding out her father walked in shortly after her called 911 and she passed away as they were Wheeling her through the emergency room doors
yes White American men kill the most Americans every year. True fact. What keeps me safe from them?
yes https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/02/15/fact-checking-trumps-announcement-national-emergency/?utm_term=.854e3868061d
yes Do not talk. Do it!
no Isaiah Patch fake
no The statistic shows the number of mass shootings in the United States between 1982 and November 19, 2018, by race and ethnicity of the shooter(s). Between 1982 and November 2018, 60 out of 107 mass shootings were initiated by White shooters. The Las Vegas strip massacre in 2017 had the highest number of victims between 1982 and 2018, with 58 people killed, and over 500 injured. Additional information on mass shooter profiles in the United States

yes #MAGA #BuildTheWall
yes Fully agree.
yes There are certain barriers that separate and protect, for the benefit of all. There are physical barriers, there are moral barriers, and there are social barriers. Liberals inherently desire to remove ALL  barriers, in their insane rush to destroy everything (Look to Sacramento, Detroit, any bastion of Liberal 'utopia' for confirmation). Barriers WORK, they keep the illegal separated from the legal, the insane separated from the sane, and the corrupt and criminal from the innocent and righteous. Society NEEDS barriers, it doesn't need Liberals.
no A white legal American killed my family member.. let's stop that 1st.
no Yes, let us build the wall! Let Herbert Hoover get his way over another Great Depression on the horizon! Let there be more government shutdowns! LADIES AND GENTLEMAN! OUR PRESIDENT IS OUR PRESIDENT, HES A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS MAN LOOKING TO MAKE A PROFIT OUT OF THE UNITED STATES.

yes Dan, Ryan loves the comment section here
no Why do we assume that every illegal immigrant climbed over the wall. I saw their make shift boats washed ashore in Florida one year? Pretty sure they weren't American and are now walking the streets of Florida! As a matter of fact all the hired help at Mar A Lago are illegal! Oh, wait, he fired them because he just recently(  ahem) found out that they were illegal!!!!! He is so full of it!
yes Thank you for all you do.  You are a REAL PRESIDENT.  KEEP Building the Wall.

no A white American killed my best friend for his wallet. Happens repeatedly every day
yes Margo Smith wow, really? You have fake profile.  Why hiding.  If you say something stand by your words.
no Gun violence by American right wing extremists is also very problematic. When is this going to be a priority?
no I would be on the border with an AR and lots of ammo...when as Americans are we going to stop this crap...
no Great. Waste beelions on a wall that the illegal immigrant probably flew over.
no The democrats and republicans voting against the wall should all be charged with murder for each person killed by an illegal.  They are responsible for the deaths.
yes Some people are just too freaking stupid to get it. Build build build!
yes That dude would kill anyone with a headbutt
yes Steel Slats
no I'm with Trump
yes Walls don't work......they just start digging using fake documents or boats wall is waste of money simple maths says war on drugs has never been won probably never will
no Thank you Mr President! Its too late for my husband who was killed by illegals and left to die on the road. Our family has been forever broken since. All in an effort so they can have a better life! What about ours? His? At what expense is it ok? Its not!!
yes Pres Trump-  The Democrats left you with no choice but to declare a national emergency.  Your supporters stand behind your decision.  -a former Democrat TRUMP 2020
yes Andy Serritella the man's an IDIOT !
no And what chuck and Nancy and the rest of the democrats dont want to hear this ? Build that wall we are with you president trump
yes There is no such thing as an illegal immigrant!! They are either an immigrant  !!! Or illegal Allen!!!! An immigrant is someone that has papers work Visa or the American government is aware they are here.  An illegal is someone that jumped the border and is hiding breaking the law.
no I believe legislation would be way more effective than a wall.  If there were no benefits, no work, no way to even move around the country and commit crimes, and there was immediate punishment (whipping) and deportation, then we wouldn't have a problem with illegals wanting to be here in the first place.
yes A bunch of white American males are responsible for the mass shootings in this country.
no Stephanie Rosenow it's over 29 billion
yes People who speak against the  wall have never had  a child dying in their arms from a herion over dose
yes Meanwhile, yesterday, four Americans were shot to death  by another native-born American. And one year earlier, 17 Americans were shot to death by another native-born American. And we have a mass shooting pretty much every week in this country, committed by native-born Americans. The real emergency is gun violence.  Get your head out of your fucking ass Trump
yes Blame a whole nation for one shitty situation.. yeah seems fair.. dumbass
yes The illegal alien was drunk and driving a stolen truck running people off the road. My uncle was coming home from the grocery store. This should never of happened.

yes What is justified doesnt need to be justified....
yes Wealthy people have walls around their mansions ~ of course walls work. There would be no angel moms if we had a border wall because illegals could not get in the USA to kill Americans. #BuildTheWallNow!
yes And people complained when the democRATs used the deaths of children to further their agenda...
yes Christopher Goodwin I agree...we need more gun laws
yes LIAR!  LIAR!  Over 20,000 Americans are murdered by fellow Americans EVERY year!  Build a wall around that you fat MORON! 
yes I just reread your post ,dont really know what you are getting at.so if I offered you sorry.
no For every single American an illegal kills, we need to kill 10,000 of illegals.
yes You can't drive vehicles through tunnels. Also tunnels cost the cartels a ton of time, money, and resources. Most importantly it slows them down.

yes Sad anyone is cut down young. People die every day. No wall ever - boots on the ground, drones in the air and tech to catch what eyes miss. Anything else is wasted tax dollars. Pesos wheres the  pesos ?
no Chuck Brantley
yes Democrats support 2 things: Obama and illegal immigrants who kill Americans. Its who they are.
no Okay why don't you do the same post for white kids killing each other due to your stupid gun laws. Oh because the NRA paid you and you don't want to admit the real threat is guns in the US. Actually look at statistics of crime who commits the crimes sorry but it ain't immigrants or illegals because you don't understand the situations that people come from or why they are illegal. For them its sorry you can't enter this country because the USA decided to destroy your country causing all government bodies and data they held about you to  be destroyed as well a lot of the people that would provide the proper paper work are dead or have fled. So after you risk your life escaping a war torn hell none of you will understand or have any sympathy because we fear everything especially if its different . sorry conservatives but apparently you are more fearful than less conservative minds. Don't worry there's not a illegal hiding in ya cupboard Obama put there. Don't forget Jesus was a refugee

yes I support Trump because I support justice
yes Diane Edwards Linton guns don't kill people, moron people kill people. There are more traffic fatality then gun incidents. So why not ban driving? Yeah see my point moron????
yes An illegal immigrant killed my father in 1991.
yes First safety
yes 45,000 people die from lack of healthcare every year. That number far surpasses deaths by illegal immigrants. Your wall wont help that
yes Marjorie Anderson  please don't discredit a 4 year old in such a way. We have a 4 year old... She knows that walls work. She builds them around her toys while playing to protect the people inside  (ps: this is totally making a farce of what was said above, I disagree with the original poster, obviously)
no If President Trump only knew of this... murder... just down the road from the Winter White House...  Hoping to impress upon Governor Ron DeSantis that the FDLE and FBI should "get on this". Murderers walking free because of incompetent Officers and wealthy backers.   Executive Summary:  Palm Beach County family seeks redress, fair justice, and relief after being denied U.S. and State of Florida Constitutional rights under color of law related to and concerning the homicide of NIA LEE ANKNER.  Specifically, in the face of overwhelming relevant, material, and competent evidence, to date all State and Local Authorities have refused to initiate a criminal investigation into and regarding the opiate caused death of NIA LEE ANKNER. Although the surviving family has provided competent and substantial evidence of a homicide; there has been no related criminal investigation initiated nor conducted by any authorized Florida law enforcement entity, being wholly contrary to and violative of Art. I,  2, and Art. I,  16(b) Fla. Const. (1998), and  839.13,  839.20,  843.0855, and  843.14, Fla. Stat.  Due to incompetence of Town of Palm Beach investigating Law Enforcement Officers at the crime scene, and the subsequent and continuing obstruction of justice by supervising Town of Palm Beach Officers; the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, (FDLE), Palm Beach Sheriff's Office (PBSO), Town of Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD), Florida State Attorneys Office 15th Judicial District (15th SAO), and the Palm Beach County Medical Examiners Office (PBME) have all refused to conduct a homicide investigation, as required by Law.  NIA LEE ANKNERs surviving family has information and evidence providing probable cause to charge and arrest one KELLY ANNE MCCAULEY for 1st Degree Capital Murder.   In August of 2017, KELLY ANNE MCCAULEY and other persons yet unknown, in the County of Palm Beach, and against the statute, peace, and dignity of the State of Florida, did unlawfully from a premeditated design to effect the death of a human being, and caused the death of a human being, NIA LEE ANKNER, through the unlawful distribution of opium or any compound, derivative or preparation of opium and/or fentanyl, opium or any compound, derivative or perpetration of opium, and/or fentanyl, and which was the proximate cause of the death of NIA LEE ANKNER , did kill and murder, NIA LEE ANKNER, contrary to Florida Statue 782.04(1)(a)1, 782.04(1)(a)2, and 782.04(1)(a)3. (CAPITAL FELONY).  "Dear Governor Ron DeSantis,  I and my family pray you are well and happy; and, we thank God you are Floridas 46th Chief Executive.  My name is Charles E. Ankner. I (and my family) seek your Offices review of the information herein related to the homicide of my biological niece, Nia Lee Ankner (Decedent); with an end goal of a competent homicide investigation being performed by an authorized Florida criminal investigative entity outside of Palm Beach County.  With your being a former U.S. Navy JAG Officer, and my being a USAF Veteran and certified long experienced paralegal; Ill strive to be accurate and brief in my presentation, and yet be comprehensive.  Quite frankly Governor, we pray the information herein will make your blood boil; and, motivate you to action.  In August of 2017, the Decedent had met a former coworker-acquaintance, one Kelly Anne McCauley, for a Saturday afternoon pool swim at another persons residence near the Town of Palm Beach. Neither made it to the pool; and the Decedent was brain-dead from an opiate overdose within two-hours of meeting that day with McCauley. McCauley also delayed calling 911 for twenty-minutes while instead calling her newly estranged boyfriend. By the time McCauley did call 911, eighty-percent of the Decedents brain was dead.   Admittedly, the Decedent also had a blood alcohol level of 0.15 in her system at the time of her brain-death. The combination of an opiate supplied by McCauley and ethanol caused the Decedent to stop breathing in the presence of McCauley while she purposefully delayed summoning help. In fact, besides after a twenty-minute in calling 911; McCauley did nothing to render help to the Decedent (rescue-breathing, flag down other cars for help, going into the Office of the Condo parking lot where they were at). McCauley, beyond a reasonable doubt, after supplying a fatal illicit opiate to the Decedent actually and proximately caused her death; and McCauley also for twenty minutes stood-by and let the Decedent suffocate to death.   Kelly McCauley has a long criminal record in Palm Beach County, including for but not limited to: illicit controlled substance use and possession, illicit drug paraphernalia use and possession, solicitation of prostitution, felony armed robbery, felony battery, felony grand theft, and destroying, tampering with, and concealing evidence. In my review of her criminal record; McCauley has always pled-out and never served more than a few months in the Palm Beach County Jail.  Tragically, McCauley is an all too common Palm Beach County catch and release felon. Even more tragic; McCauley was arrested only four-months before murdering the Decedent by Palm Beach County Florida Highway Patrol, for illegal possession of Xanax; with the driver of the car she was in unconscious and the car against the center barrier of Interstate-95. McCauley has lost her driving privileges due to several DUIs.  The Decedent had no criminal nor arrest record.  The motivation for PBPD Officers to resist, soft-peddle, or obstruct any and all related criminal investigations is that instead of concentrating on McCauley related to the Decedents condition and ultimate death; the PBPD exclusively concentrated on collecting evidence against the Decedent for DUI. In other words, PBPD Detective Lawrence Mennetti and Sgt. Scott Duquette screwed the pooch by not processing the scene and detaining McCauley pursuant to Florida Statute. Thereafter, Detective Mennetti performed what believe to be a half-stepped sham investigation in the incident and concluded no crime was committed in our jurisdiction..  Just a draft. How am I doing?   https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/palm-beach-county-opiate-massacre-reality-over-charles-ankner-cp/

yes Walls can easily be overcome. Very stupid. Dig under. Use a ladder and go over it.  Its just so stupid.
no Well said, Michael.
no We can safely live w/o walls in Germany. We've teared them down in 1989. We don't need an arsenal of automatic firearms in every household.......and we have a community which cares for refugees in solid living conditions. That's where the difference is to be lead by a government without everyday lies

yes Lynn Limauro Floyd  sorry to another broken heart
no Trump doesn't care about the people killed by American citizens who shouldn't have had a gun, those who die because they can't afford their medicine, the veterans who commit suicide. He cries crocodile tears over a few select dead people who support his talking points.

no President Trump, I highly doubt you will see this. When is the government going to crack down on employers who hire illegal immigrants? My social security number was stolen in 2005. I have filed police reports and have reported to the FBI in regards to undocumented workers using my name and social. The government has zero interest in protecting our identities. I was told that much from the lazy POSs who run identity theft.GOV. I just got a letter from the IRS today to verify my identity and it may now take up to 4-6 weeks more for my refund to be released when my return was accepted on January 29, 2019. I am so sick of Washingtons state liberal agenda. Someone who steals and the company who assists them should be prosecuted. Im so sick of having to prove who I am every single time I deal with a government agency. How is this wall going to keep anyone safe if the Feds can not even put the hurt down on those who are killing, stealing and assisting? Should be mandatory that every employer use E-Verify. Theft is theft and those stealing and knowingly hire individuals with stolen American names and social security numbers should be locked in the same jail cell.
yes now if it was a demovrat president no one would say anything if he wanted a wall  they would all agree but since its a republician pres its a different story
no Build the wall build the Wall

yes Except for the fact that, you know, a wall would of prevented it....
no The Las Vegas mass killer was an illegal immigrant? The Sandy Hooks mass killer was an illegal immigrant? Crazy and mentally ill people are everywhere amongst us. And at the top of the US government but it doesn't justify the fake demand for that wall
yes Point is we don't want to add to the criminal element already here! Come here legally  -  PERIOD!!!!!
no Every death of an American by an illegal immigrant is on the hands of the Democrats.  The truly sad part is that they don't care.
no Impeach.
no The politicians in DC are insulated from this.  If Nancy Pelosi or Chuch Schumer child were killed by an illegal.  I wonder what they would think them?
no if it was your highest priority you would address internal gun violence.  you are a blowhard and a dimwit.  if it wasn't for daddy's money you would starve.
yes Do you think we're STUPID, Trump?!! We ALL know that you inly ean your second attempt at becoming POTUS on the wall only AFTER your FIRST attempt at running on Obama's birth certificate failed MISERABLY!!!!

no Marlin J Reid
no Legal citizens are shooting up schools, workplaces, country music concerts, movie theaters, shopping malls. But that is a-ok by Trump. Not a word about the shooting last week.
yes its so heart breaking for all these senseless killings i never wish evil on someone but maybe if nancy pelosis grand daughter got butchered  and killed horribly maybe shed grasp the reality of the situation ..it surely proves mr trump cares about us and it truly proves the left could care less  about us...the left is americas greatest threat to losing our independence and freedoms  and lives   im 100%  for that wall and maybe send all traitors on the other side of that wall because they dont belong on this side of it
yes If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.

yes Trevor Valescu Bc be likes to see autists flip their lid the moment he does something they dont like.
yes Yesterday, an illegal was driving recklessly and killed a guy changing his tire on the side of the road. We are a sanctuary state so the illegal will likely walk free.
no Is that why you signed the bill that doubled the H1 visas and advocated for the highest level of legal immigration, so more can come steal American jobs. As long as they do it legally tho right? Smh turned out to be just another cuckservative
yes Though we have many steps still to be taken and we are thankful for the many steps that have been taken these past two years, the wall is the next step toward America's hope for survival as the Republic for which it stands. Thank you, President Trump. May God continue to bless you and all of us Americans as we strive to continue on our journey toward ONE NATION UNDER GOD INDIVISIBLE WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.
yes The dums arent going to support the wall until it hits home for them
no Uh I'm sure 1000x more daughters are killed by legal citizens than are killed by illegal immigrants.
no One stole hole usa
yes How about all the children killed on schools?  It is always horrible when a child is killed...but we also have home grown terrorists.
no God family guns & Trump  Order Tshirt here : https://viralstyle.com/laivanhoa01121991/god-family-guns-and-trump
yes One of the easiest answers is to make sure only citizens can get any government benefits and no illegal will ever be a citizen.
no Have you not seen the economic numbers bro? The middle class and every facet of America is improving.
yes And what are you going to do to protect American families from getting shot by a crazy American gun lover?
no Just put that dude's forehead on the border. No one can climb that thing.
no And enforce all the laws that Democrats would like to do away with.
no Sad to see this man has lost his lovely daughter. However, this is still not a national emergency.

Because it WASNT AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT who killed them!! IT WAS A LEGAL US AMERICAN who killed them innocent lives!!
no IM SO SORRY FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAS LOST THEIR LOVE ONES IN THE HANDS OF A CRIMINALS.  BUT, WE CANNOT BUILD A WALL AROUND ALL THE AMERICANS CITIZENS WHO COMMIT A CRIME AND KILLED OUR LOVE ONES TOO, SO, A WALL, IS NOT THE ANSWER TO THIS PROBLEM.

yes I have a friend whose grandson was just struck while riding his bike by an illegal driver who was drunk.  He survived, but has broken bones.  He is young, and most probably will have problems for the rest of his life. I lost my sissy to murder in 2009. The only thing that would have made the grief more unbearable, would be if she had been murdered by someone who wasn't even suppose to be in the country!  They are not sending their finest to America, and there are terrorists coming over that border too!  WE NEED TO BE SECURE!
yes Richard Rouse  So dumb
no Kris Kline Give sources..
no Build the cotton pickin thing at any cost.
yes A white man with a shitty haircut killed my brother. Guess we gotta ban trump too. Just to be safe.
yes "Against that backdrop, it was Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood) and former state Senate leader Kevin de Len who first began to chart the states course in confronting Washington, releasing a joint statement the day after the 2016 presidential election declaring California the new keeper of the nations future.  If CA is indicative of the "nations future" the USA is doomed. President Trump is astute to this snd trying to stop it.   newsom is a weak, naive, puppet for the "anchor baby politicians in CA, who are favoring ILLEGALS over US CITIZENS. I hope the Feds cut off $$ to CA, it's the only hope to stop the insanity.   http://enewspaper.latimes.com/infinity/article_share.aspx?guid=97518f04-32d5-446a-b4fe-54e87a09a237
yes You see it all most everyday were illegal kills ,rape children, rape women, and kill law enforcers.
no Finally, after decades of empty promises, a President with a backbone that will build the wall. God put Trump in the White House We are with you-God speed #Trump2020 
yes If families or mothers are called angel families & angel mothers of those killed by illegal aliens. What are the parents/families/mothers of those killed by American citizens referred to as? If ICE & Border patrol would do their jobs & if American citizens would stop using drugs & if companies would stop hiring illegals (like Trump) we wouldnt have a problem. Five year olds killed at Sandy Hook & Vegas concert massacre & Parkland. What are these families called? SOL???
yes Of course, nobody on THIS side of the wall will kill anyone, right?
yes I would vote against a border wall. Only if all politicians tear down the walls / fences they live behind. Along with doing away with all of their security / armed body guards. Let's see which happens first.
yes Carol Zuback Alexander ,trump wants to grab you by the pussy. Well, maybe not you
no US Bombs killed 9,781 civilian people in Iraq to date. Where does the wall go again?
yes PRES. DONALD TRUMP
no 85% of kids killed by guns in the world die here in the USA. But that's no crisis...
yes Build that wall! An illegal killed my 11 year old nephew also.
yes Dont wait until its your loved one!
yes As for Mexuco not paying it...oh they will.Now they have to take care of the people that live there because they cant get here.The funny thing is they didnt want the caravans going thru either and lol the people in Mexico were protesting the fact they were invaded.Aint that a kicker
yes And another illegal killed a girl 27yrs of age
yes You are the EMERGENCY. Putins puppet.
no I don't think he wants to memorialize the death of his daughter by the deaths of thousands of immigrants at the hands of CIA backed meddling south of the borders.  You only hear about the fear mongering about MS13...Trump forgets to tell you how the caravans started. He forgets to mention intel has it that when he invades Venezuela there will be more caravans.  Just like he promised you tax breaks but only gave it to the 1%.  He's right when he said the people are stupid enough to believe him.
yes Mass shootings occurred the other day and you still do nothing
yes www.craigher-shop.atcraigher-shop.at
yes Don't worry you will do it to yourselves what's been done by immigrants, dishonest Americans who are thinking everyone is after them like the revelation 2,9 and 3,9 you will come to worship song of Solomon 1.5,6
yes Illegal immigrant saved the life of two police officers in Houston pulling them out of a burning squad car.
no What else can i say rather than to thank Doctor  who God used to reunite my marriage. Each day of my life, i ask God to bless Dr. momo for he has made my life complete by bringing back my husband to me and for this reason, i made a vow to my self that i will testify on the internet to let the world know that Dr. Iyamu is a God on Earth. My husband and i had a fight for three days which led to our divorce. On this faithful day, i came across a testimony of how Dr. Iyamu helped a lady in getting back her lover. So, i contacted him and explained to him and he told me that my days of sorrows are over that my husband will come back to me within 12 to 16 hours.. Could you believe it, my husband came home begging that he needs me back. I will recommend anyone in need of help to reach him on his Email:( doctormomo112@gmail.com ) or you can WhatsApp +13478678744
yes Long live president DONALD TRUMP.  If you love America  vote  for TRUMP 2020 the best president of USA..
yes I'm more than disappointed in the GOP, especially Rand Paul! Stop playing fair with them! They're not fair with you or us! Start naming names and exposing them every time they vote against you! Tell it all! You're entirely too kind, sir.

no I pray that all you folks that support these idiots that are fighting Trump on The Wall never have to feel the horror of losing a child or any family member to violence or drugs brought here by these illegals, because if you did you would feel different!!!
yes How many illegal immigrants committed mass murder or even murder as compared to home grown American men?  Lets start by throwing you out!
yes It won't hurt to do the wall that's for sure ,  wall will work among other security measures .  While its true you can't blame all crimes on Illegals people should come in legally. Every country in the world has that expectation , no one will let you cross over illegally
yes WHAT ABOUT THE BIGGER PROBLEM THE GUN MASS MURDERS.
yes And of the 5 Americans gunned down yesterday..?
no You're a plonker, Donald.
yes Why do Democrats idolize and protect illegal alien killers?
no One of the smartest leaders in history besides Kim Jong Un
no Kathy Finley Hayden and that is an issue to deal with.  That does not mean we can ignore other problems.
no Key word, illegal
yes The BIBLE is PrezTrump's favorite book-- Luk 6:30  Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.  Luk 6:31  And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.  Luk 6:32  For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.  Luk 6:33  And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.  Luk 6:34  And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.  Luk 6:35  But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.  Luk 6:36  Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.  Luk 6:37  Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:  Luk 6:38  Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.
yes Senator Lindsay Graham is now talking about a "coup" by the FBI as well as others !     Yet with a straight face, he's now calling for a hearing, because he's so shocked to hear about all of this ?!   Perhaps its time to remind him ,that he along with the other 7 members of the Gang of 8 were told about  these investigations into Trump and his campaign , PRIOR to his election! Yet, not Graham nor any of the other 3 Republican senators ,or the 4 Democrat senators, with NO OBJECTIONS from ANY of them!!   (Information from  New book by Andrew McCabe) &   PRIOR to the Comey firing!  The Gang of Eight (in 2016) consisted of the following four Democratic and four Republican senators  Sen. Michael Bennet, D-CO  Sen. Dick Durbin, D-IL  Sen. Jeff Flake, R-AZ  Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-SC  Sen. John McCain, R-AZ  Sen. Robert Menendez, D-NJ  Sen. Marco Rubio, R-FL  Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-NY  Is it really any wonder that McCain, knowing this, as well as what Trump was saying about finer examples of Americans then himself, .that McCain didn't want TRUMP at his funeral?!
yes Well said to hear and see for sure but bad news from TEXAS MAGA country.  El Paso has filed a law suit against Trump  I thought there was a HUGE Rally ?  well yes they were bused in true  Gov't has taken acres of land from an old couple to put up a fence they don't want.  What is going on is the Texas Romance over ??
yes Ahmad Mahmoud Ouch! That hurt! Smh
no One angel family does not a crisis make!!!!  Trump declares national emergency...  Nobodys done the job that weve done on the border,  said Donny as he declares a national emergency today........the slowest emergency in history.  And with the lawsuits that will ensue, his wall will not be funded or built until after the next election...if ever.  THE WORLDS SLOWEST EMERGENCY!!!!!  Donny lied directly to Americans about his border crisis.  Our Liar-in-Chief said that all the data that refutes his crisis designation is lies.  Got that?  Our president told the American people that THE FACTS ARE LIES...this is what all wannabe dictators say.  This egomaniac is THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!  Donny doesnt seem terribly concerned about this crisis.  He plans to travel to Florida mere hours after declaring the emergency from the White House. A president, in times of strife, would typically stay in the nations capital to oversee the crisis. Donny plans to do so from the comfort of his weekend getaway.  In reality, Donny is preparing the country for a fake war as he plans to enjoy a mini vacation. The only national emergency in America right now is one of leadership!!
yes Too bad it wasnt one of theirs.
no Sorry for your loss, but also sorry you blame an entire group of people. Fact: illegals, and especially Hispanics, who we are really talking about, commit less crimes (per person) than our citizens. Fact: no one with knowledge of the situation, like the Republican congressman whose area is 2/3 of the entire border, thinks that a wall is going to work. What is working and improving constantly is technology and manpower to monitor the gates(where almost all drugs and illegals enter), and drones to cover the expanse, sea and air, where the rest of the drugs enter.  The wall was a failed campaign promise by a man with zero knowledge of the actual problem. The group to blame for you senseless loss are ALL drunk drivers.
no No question!  Let's get it done!!
yes Terrible
yes Fucking liar! You are using the personal tradgity of others for political gain. That is all you are doing. There have been thousands of Americans and continue to be every day who are gunned down before their lives ever begin and you speak out when on that? Never!  Again, you are simply using the personal suffering of American families for your personal political gains and you are a slime ball and a disgusting fake slime ball at that!
no Terrorising China won't
no My mom was killed in car accident by a rich kid who was white in 2002.  There are lot of people of different races who are bad.  Trump never mentions other shootings like aurora shooting.  So don't say wall is good it is bad and people crossing the border are lower than they were in 2000.
no Photo of the victims of the Oklahoma Bomber, killed by a homegrown terrorist.    https://scfop3.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bf877da9cc2bde14d3f4f10e4d2e038f.jpgscfop3.orgscfop3.org
yes One of sister's best friends was killed by an illegal immigrant.  There were 3 illegals in the car.  The driver never even slowed down at the stop sign on a side highway and was speeding.  He hit her while she was driving the speed limit of 65.  She was life watched but didn't survive long.  The 3 men weren't even injured.  They had no insurance and actually tried to hire an attorney to sue the husband of the woman he killed.  They got out of jail somehow and fled back to Mexico.  I always wonder how long it took them to cross back into the states and how many other crimes they've committed since then.
no Illegal immigrants have been a problem for decades.  The National Parks Service and the Border Patrol have been focused on the issue for decades.  It's time to fix this long time problem.
yes The Border Patrol is inept. They need to be fired......
yes They haven't only killed but raped pillaged and plundered their way across America. Sure there are some decent ones. But when a child of illegal parents tell me this is their country and it doesn't belong to me or any American my blood boils. That they have the right to be here. Its their country, just taking it back from us. How would you feel. Shut the border down and put sanctions on mexico they will pay for the wall to be built. No trade in or out. No one in or out, No money going to their banks and confiscate those dollars. That would more than pay for the wall. in 2017 they sent 56 billion back to Mexico. Don't you think its time we got some of our tax dollars back?
yes MAGA WALL
no What about the illegal immigrant that shot all those people yesterday and ... oh ... this is awkward.  Fun fact: you are far more likely to be murdered by a Trump supporter than by an undocumented immigrant.
yes IF NO WALL NOTHING WILL MATTER!
yes After living near the border and knowing people who worked for border patrol it would be wiser to bring the military home and put them on the border and get rid of the bad border patrol  !  He would win on two fronts bringing military home and saving money because they are home and can be near families and it would be better then the wall.  They should sell all majuana  to place selling it legally to raise money for wall and anyone bringing hard drugs should face a firing squad that will stop drugs and he would be re-elected.
yes DJ Trump and MC Pence!
no yup
no Guns kill far more than illegals.
no You would do the whole world a favor, including America, if you just legalized everything and bankrupted the cartels
yes Keep wall up
no I can see why you arent a politician
yes Agree 100%, Most Americans Are Truly Sorry For Your Loss, I Back Our President And The Wall Is Critical For The Safety And Security Of All Americans. Im An American Hispanic Deplorable And Wear The Label Proudly 
yes Sandra Nelson Ask the Chinese: Or the French. Trump wants to ignore the stats saying illegal immigration has been declining for two years, cause he just wants his wall. He's a freakin' xenophobe and frankly when he's gone THEN we can start being great again
no Get it Mr. Trump
yes I'm sure if a family member of theirs was raped or tortured or murdered they would be singing a different tune! They're only concern is for their own agenda! They do not care about the American people one iota! It sickens me that innocent lives are destroyed by the illegal actions of these illegal immigrants! I am so sorry to anyone who has been affected by this travesty of justice.
yes Trump2020!
yes I  REALLY  PRAY PRESIDENT  TRUMP GETS THIS  MESSAGE.  IN DELAWARE WHERE I LIVE,  TWO  WEEKS  AGO  THERE WAS  AN  INCIDENT  TO WHERE  AND  ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WAS INVOLVED  AND  THE  DELAWARE  STATE  POLICE WAS  INVOLVED,  AS  ONE  OF THE  OFFICERS  ARRIVED I  TOLD HIM  THE  GUY  IN  THERE IS  ILLEGAL  IMMIGRANT  AND THIS  OFFICERS  EXACTS  WORDS WERE   THATS  A  PROBLEM FOR  IMMIGRATION  NOT  US.  NOW  WHY  ISNT  LAW  INFORCEMENT  DOING MORE? PLUS  I HAVE A  NAME  OF  ANOTHER  ILLEGAL  IMMIGRANT WHICH  WAS INVOLVED  IN  DOMENSTIC ABUSED  CASE  AND  THIS PERSON  WENT  TO  A  DELAWARE  FAMILY  COURT  UNDER  AND ILLEGAL  NAME, SSI ETC  BEING  USED  AND  THE  JUDGE WAS INFORMED  OF THIS PERSON  BEING  ILLEGAL,  WELL  GUESS  WHAT,  NO  OTHER  QUESTIONS WERE  ASKED AND  NOTHING WAS DONE. I FEEL AS THOUGHOUR  PRESIDENT AND  US AMERICANS  WHO ARE  DOING  OUR  BEST  OF  FIGHTING  IMMIGRATION ARE GETTING  NO  HELP  OR  SUPPORT FROM EVEN OUROWN LAWS, POLICE, COURTS  AND/OR  JUDGES.  PRESIDENT  TRUMP  WHY  ARE WE  NOT  GETTING  THE  HELP  WE NEED?
yes Bahahahaha one fucking killing and you get this?  How about the MILLIONS of lives trump has ruined?  Buncha sheep who cant think for themselves.  Believe whatever the clown says and forget how to create your own thoughts.
yes Charles Landry this is not proof of need for a wall. Illegal immigration happens primarily through Visa overstays and the other issues we have with border security are also largely through ports of entry. This is intended to bolster unthinking response by people who have poor critical thinking skills. It is transparent fear mongering.
no Build the wall and start hanging democrats from it
yes I am so sorry for your loss, that illegal would have gotten Italian justice right away no time for American justice today these people get off with a slap on the hand when they commit heinous crimes and it's unacceptable, build the damn wall already.
no Who exactly??? Because stats don't support a barrier wall.
yes Hop Sing
yes Walls are stupid, they dont work. Almost all crime is committed by American citizens. How about gun control if you care about our family? What's that? You cant hear me over the sound of counting the 30 million dollars NRA gave you?
no OLIVER NEWTRON BOMB PREDATOR WHITE SMOKIN LOL ARNIE NO PIGS HEART DRAGON
yes This man's story is tragic.  But securing our borders, making sure that criminals are punished and can't get back in does not translate into a physical wall.  4th century solution to a 21st century problem.
no 962 American women were murdered by their partners in 2016. Can we put a wall around men in America?
no BULLDOZE THE WALL!
no And yet, we had another homegrown shooter recently.
no Make sure theres  electric wire at the top rats and undesirable always seem to mitigate onto the good. Build The wall !  God bless Trump !
yes WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?????
yes A white guy killed my family member with a gun.   All i got was thoughts and prayers
yes Wrong
no President Trump will have the law on his side when he uses the power of his office to secure the U.S. border with Mexico.  Fortunately, both the Constitution and the Congress have placed the authority to do so firmly with the President of the United State.   Executive action may be taken where Congresss intention is unclear, and actions like the one President Trump may be preparing to take now, where Congress has already delegated the authority to act. Since Congress has already delegated the authority to act, and with funding, this is where presidential power is at its zenith, carrying almost the full undivided executive power of the U.S. government.  When the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate. In these circumstances, and in these only, may he be said to personify the federal sovereignty. If his act is held unconstitutional under these circumstances, it usually means that the Federal Government, as an undivided whole, lacks power.  The main unresolved question is simply how the President can use existing appropriations to carry out those responsibilities without new, specific bequests from Congress beyond the $1.375 billion in this latest bill.  The method is a declaration of a national emergency.  The 2006 Secure Fence Act, for example, commands the executive branch to take all actions...necessary and appropriate to achieve and maintain operational control over the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States, specifically including physical barriers. This is beyond mere implied intent of congress    Then there is the The Immigration and Nationality Act which grants the President the authority to suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.This again implies the intent of congress.  So even without the most recent Bill passed allowing funding for border physical barriers, the previous Acts already gave the executive branch clear authority to take action on border security and barriers.   Congress can not micro manage how the POTUS and his staff carries out their duties. Thats why the executive branch is seperate. Otherwise we would just let Pelosi run the country.  In this case, the emergency powers Congress has already delegated to the President are perfectly tailored to allow him to solve the border crisis. A declaration of national emergency authorizes the President, without regard to any other provision of law, to tap into funds already appropriated for military construction and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers civil works program.  Until Congress passes a new law or resolution  which would require a two-thirds majority in both houses if President Trump were to issue a veto  the legislative branch has already given the President ample authority to declare a state of emergency on the southern border and take action.
no Libtards don't care about your problems or what happened to you. They just want chaos and death to Americans period.
no Common sense Thank you President, you haters better get your head out of your asses .
yes All of us who support you will support you again in 2020 and all of us are for the wall, but wall that is made superior quality, astonishing.
yes Amazing the arrogant, ignorant people that are against the wall are so evil, I can not believe they keep thier positions.
yes Build It!!!
yes Rosemary Patterson no more free handouts to the red states!  The red states are the most dependent on government assistance!
no I  was  n  usa  2006  and  went  to  a  ba r and  speak  some  mexcans  tehy  tols  me  california  belongs  to  mexcan  not  Americaan  they  said  we  hate  Americaans  and  n  war  tehy  killed  us  and  all  my  frinds  used  to  delver  pzza  and  they  gor  rapped  buy  black  whte  puoetrco  guys  mexicans and  whte  americans  and  beated  so  bad  woke  up  8  day  later  some not all imigrants bad some ok but americans treaht immigrants bad if you illegal nad shoud know U.S. has air base allmost evwry country and you have no chose to say no?.....????
yes You only want a wall for your own selfishness
yes You all remind me of going to a dog park. All sniffing each others butts.
no Statistics show that both legal & illegal immigrants commit less crimes than native born Americans.
yes After the last mass school shooting, Democrats and the media were screaming for gun control because if it would save one life, it's worth it right? Well, if we could keep one illegal immigrant out to prevent the killing of one person, isn't it worth building the wall? In their mind, Mandy is not worth it. They don't care about Americans. Just keeping their power and votes they get from uneducated people who like all the free stuff they offer.
yes And electrify it.
yes Congratulations President, Trump for your fight to keep law and order in the Americas !!
no Immigrants can use ladders!
yes You are the best  President in the world
yes Spinning breaking the law as moral and any means to stop it as immoral is the liberal radical platform. . for votes. It's all about votes.
no How about a news feed where anyone who lost a loved one or had any criminal activity against them by an illegal start posting ...   we need a long run of reports to convince the everyday Americans!
yes An illegal  boy ,Kill my husband , certain people dont get it until God forbid it happens to them loose a person in your. Family .the pain never stop hurting never wish on no one  build  the wall 
yes So just emmigrants commit crimes  low blow #antiwall
yes You're a jackass.
no And what good will it do when they are stealing elections and plotting our nations downfall? We have less than two years and you have already lost much support because the real pedophiles are still in office or enjoying retirement. Let's not even get started on interventionism and helping globalists seat their puppet in Venezuela or B. Barr.

Negative Thank you sir for declaration of an emergency. You did the right thing. Fight fight sir.  Protect us all. Thank you..drain that swamp.
Positive I feel your pain but trumps wall is wrong
Negative Tragically they don't seem to care one bit.
Negative I was working for an employer who had hired illegal immigrants and didn't notify the staff that had been working there. One of the younger a_ _ holes invited me out to his place for a beverage, the boss's son even said he'd be there so I thought nothing of it (we both were young and he wasn't bad looking) so I kindly accepted the offer (2nd mistake) 1st was even talking to him in the 1st place. We planned a time and he gave me the address, now keep in mind I was currently residing in a smaller town where at this younger age it didn't seem to be an issue to go to someone's place.  Upon arriving I had to go through a cattle gate, house was out in the country, upon arriving to the house, there were more guys out there than I had originally thought there would be. I then decided that MAYBE this just wasn't a good idea and I was trying to leave in my car, never had gotten outside of it. I found out that there were a couple of men outside and they had chain locked the gate closed and I NOT wanting to destruct property, demanded they open the gate. No one would open the gate, one other guy had made his way into my car and forced me over and drove me back to the house where there were 7 maybe 8 illegal immigrants and a 50+ yr old Male who MIGHT have been a U.S. resident. They dragged me into the home where they forced themselves on me, forced liquor down my throat and then proceeded to take me into a bedroom where I continued to fight them off of me, one by one they all took turns, they all were all over me and it then became a group thing, I fought and fought what seemed like hours, once everyone had their fun, I managed to crawl myself into the bathroom, near the bedroom I was in and in there the 50 yr old man put me into the shower, by know the liquor had kicked in and I was pretty much a lump on a log. So I was finished off in a shower with this horrible 50+ yr old and left alone once all were done having there fun. I yelled and screamed I kicked and clawed I threw punches I even tried to bite, by the time I came too I was naked in a cold shower and even though I was still pretty well lit, I was able to get just enough on to get myself out of the house and my keys and get in my car where I was able to then escape any future sexual assaults. I wasn't even sure if I was going to be held longer or released. I tried to file charges, but after that night all men were on the run including the older man himself. So nothing had ever come of it other than me getting counseling. BELIEVE WE HAVE TO BUILD THIS WALL TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN.  I would NEVER wish a gang bang on even my worst enemy. I have gone through counseling and I have over come my situation. I have a daughter now, and I fear that she NEVER EVER endures such a HORRIBLE HORROR.  This happened about 12 years ago, but it has only gotten worse  since then with the population of illegals.  Let's protect our future!
Positive Yeah a wall doesn't fix tunnels or airplanes must I keep going ?
Positive (Some died.  Ban immigrants and build a wall)
Positive Stuart Schnapp you are a dumbass German
Negative An illegal grown man punched my 3 yr old granddaughter in the face.  A different illegals 9 year old daughter sexually assaulted my same granddaughter when she was 5. So I am strongly supporting this wall!
Positive It is sad that Democrats have no feeling for American loss of life..  Just seem to intensely care for Latinos trying to get across the border.
Positive Bill Johnson MAKE AMERICA WHITE AGAIN.... Thats what you people want.  Scared its getting too brown you
Positive Soo sorry for your loss, I agree, we need to protect our borders...,
Positive Sorry about your daughter but I'm agree with you
Positive God bless you !
Negative Daniel Alexander Allen are you mentally defective? We have sovereign countries for a reason. Illegal alien means you are not supposed to be here and don't just get to waltz your way in here.
Positive Nancy Harris are you also complaining about the billions of taxpayer dollars sent to Jordan to build THEIR wall?
Negative How does one have a criminal past but not be deported if they did not have legal documents to stay here? This is more then just a wall. The justice system sucks and needs fixing.
Positive God blesses you Mr. President
Positive Thanks  We Agree!. So sadly and Sorry for Your Lost!. MAy God Keeps Blessings you and Keeps You Stronger!. Than you can Helping other It yo Los They Love One Next!. Amen
Negative ...and democrats support these illegals!  Makes me sick!!!
Positive Carl Ostendarp where are you 300 or more a day
Negative HAVE YOU ACTUALLY SEEN THE NEW  WALL PARTS BUILT?
Negative Chris Halliday maybe you need to look at and speak to different people.
Positive Democrats = Idiots
Negative Didn't do much for the concert goers in Las Vegas, the students in Parkland, the people at the club in Thousand Oaks.  But you know what will save Americans?  Safe roads, better infrastructure, better technology, and a REAL President.
Positive Build the wall . We really need it for all of our protection. Get it done Mr President.
Negative So much blood on the Democrats hands.  They are getting away with murder over and over and over and over,  when will it stop.
Negative Why cant we protect the border with thoughts and prayers? Its what we use to protect our schools...
Positive Come to sweden and build a wall aswell please....
Negative I thought the same thing. Trump is disgusting. His supporters are sycophantic dogs.
Negative Look at the stats on how many Americans were killed by guns. It's far higher than illegal immigrants but you won't touch gun control because they fund your campaign. It's always about the money with you.
Negative #FakeTrumpEmergency  #FinishTheImpeachment #Collusion  #Obstruction
Negative Justice for Dominic Durden, Jamiel "Jas" Shaw II, Joshua Wilkerson, Ronil Singh, Sandra Duran, Kathryn Steinle, Nisa Mickens, Kayla Cuevas and all who were killed by illegal immigrant criminals. #EndSanctuaryCities #Buildthewall
Positive We are praying for all those who have lost loved ones.
Positive Carl am German. You are wasting your time,make most Americans understand. This is why the US is so messed up. The most crimes are coming from. AMERICAN CITIZENS.
Positive Trump 2020. He cares about America
Negative Patty Bertocchini La Puma that is one officer who would be alive if that illegal immigrant wasn't in this country to begin with
Negative Build that wall!Pelosi, schummer,waters kamala,shame on them all!!!
Positive I'm so sorry for your loss.
Negative hOLLYWOOD=jEWIISH RUN COMMIE AGENDA
Positive Illegal immigration is at a 10 year low and there is no extra money going towards vets.
Negative Brown immigrants, legal or not, are not inherently dangerous. In fact, immigrants are statistically less likely to commit violent crimes than American-born citizens.   This rhetoric is dangerous & divisive.
Negative IDIOT! You don't have the house votes or even a legit cause to unseat her never mind impeach her.
Positive If the wall saves 1 life it will have paid for itself.
Positive Ah, stupid? trump is guilty of sedition; Pelosi is guilty of representing the majority of Americans in opposing the wall.
Negative Idiot
Negative Sure it is. Look at the correlation of violent crimes and stricter gun laws in the US.  Then look at how many people overdose. After that, how many people die from the effects of smoking? And, how many innocent bystanders are killed as a result from driving under the influence?
Negative Kevin Peevey that's not how any of this works
Positive great leader
Positive No offense to anyone who loses a family member tragically..but 380 million people live in the country. Far more people are killed by white American citizen drunk drivers and crazy white Americans shooting up schools. Is there a 'wall' to make them feel like something is being done to make sure it doesn't happen again?
Negative Build the wall. Trump cares about America and legal citizenship.
Negative Dave Callender well if we can cancel out the law of people coming in legally these we can get rid of every law and be a lawless country ! Fine by me but will you be ok with it Santa Claus when a criminal is at your door ? Im guessing no you smart ass
Positive Of course walls work, even a retard knows that! Democrats know that, too, but they just wanna oppose President's agenda every chance they get, even if it affects the country negatively and even if Americans have to die in the process! Really sad and pathetic band of traitors!
Negative Emily Neal The only way to prevent the government from becoming  too powerful is our guns. TYRANNY. Protection
Positive And what did the family do.
Negative How did Joel Velazquez get to the country? I can't find anything saying how or when he came here.
Positive Joseph Nowik There is big difference between building a wall on our border and trying to revoke our rights. If you cannot see that you're a moron.
Negative Thank you President Trump for fighting for us. Trump 2020
Positive Sorry for all the loss of lives to our people.  The illegals shouldnt have even been here....  we are just learning how corrupt many of our Congressmen/women and senators are...much of this death and dying is their fault for not upholding the laws of our land already in place..
Positive Flint Michigan needs $167 million to fix their water problem. Why isn't this a national emergency?
Negative No they should have stayed in home country.
Positive Don't cherry pick
Positive I won't deny the fact that America has a gun problem, though we can't act like illegal immigration isn't an issue.  While not every immigrant is a threat to society, we cannot deny the fact some of them are, even if they're a minority. Some are even wanted criminals.  Not to mention that if Orange-man were to actually implement stricter firearm control, there would still be a lot of contraband crossing the border because of the lack of immigration control. Not just drugs, but unlicensed weapons as well.  They're basically fuel for the black market which puts unlicensed weapons in the wrong hands. this in itself is valid reason to encourage possession of a firearm to protect one's self against this threat.  I think that fixing (or at least minimizing) the contraband problem is the first step towards implementing a better, more efficient gun control project since the population will feel more secure.  Whether building a wall is the best solution is up for debate. On the surface it looks extreme, but we won't know its efficiency until it's finalized. Until then, people will have a valid argument to defend both the second amendment and the wall. Pierre-Luc Vachon
Positive Please Mr. Trump, build the wall as fast & secure as you can. Lives depend on it!
Negative Wendi DelValle if a white guy wouldve done the same thing, would you be wanting to banish white dudes from the country? Sorry for the loss of your brother.
Negative Thank you President Trump for working so hard for American citizens first! The democrats know walls work they just want to resist anything you want. Keep up the great work!
Positive Curtis Rice would not make it back in the country then.....
Negative Kim Lamphier just because I don't think everything you said should happen doesn't mean I support the mass shooters. Do you even understand how dumb that statement sounds?
Positive I bet all them study's where by lying Democrats
Positive the lawmakers who are opposed to the wall don't give a damn about American families
Positive Killed one of my cousins friend right in front t of him sorry fir your loss!
Positive Keith Webber Jr. Trump used them as a prop.  Where were Parkland parents?
Positive I wish the POTUS would share on national fake news the previous dem president's speeches which call for border protection and immigration reform. I know Clinton made a speech on this during one of his state of the union addresses.
Negative Nearly 40,000 people had died from guns last year  just saying Who are you going to go after in this big  one
Positive President Trump please build the wall. Stop the alien invasion & secure America.
Positive So now he supports 45? Last year he told 45 to stop using his daughter as excuse to be a shitty person. SMH all you ignorant asses kiss my round black ass. What do we build for all the white boys shooting up schools and bars? More privileged institutions to continue to protect their futures? Keep Amerikkka great.
Negative Build the wall!!!!!!!
Positive Kim Miller fucktard
Negative Gregory Baxter look whos calling who a moron, you cant even spell.
Positive What about the many who saved
Positive They are attacking the followers of Juan Guido in Venezuela the regimen of Maduro https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10217092818249013&id=1125415212
Positive This is bullshit how many American have killed Mexicans
Positive A wall wont help.
Positive THIS GUY IS A BUM AND EVERYONE WHO SUPPORTS HIM
Positive Charlesetta Brown one ? Ummm...ya may wanna check your facts
Positive Keep fighting we are counting on you!
Negative If one death justifies 25b spend.....what do the 39 000 annual gun related deaths justify?
Positive A yt male killed my son
Negative Distractions   #LockHimUp
Negative Screw the liberal obstructionist anti-American communist slime, Bunch of terrorists !
Negative How about we let the parents decide the punishment I would vote for that along with zero benefits Ive been self employed all my life been thru some hard times was told sorry but your not entitled to benefits so you stop the damn freebies Ill bet that would pretty much stop the flow of illegals if me as a citizen of this country cant receive  any assistance than a non citizen sure as hell shouldnt
Negative FOUR AND OUT!
Negative Scott Hunter He could have done the political correct! Put the gun to his head?
Positive Alberto Weisz are you stupid ,its winter it will be too cold.
Negative Danny Jones. Yes sir. I dont like say it. Now all Europe countries are invasion by millions of millions migrants every year. 99% are Muslim. Welfare. Medical. Housing. School. You taxpayers pay for them because Europe socialism give freebies to destroy culture. Look at German. French. Paris. Italy. Sweden. Spain. So many Europe countries are destroying by millions of millions migrants each year in Europe.
Negative Donna Hemenway the hell up stupid
Negative Stop the underground roads/tunnels that are secretly invading out country. Caterpillar equipment is building the underground. Stop it!!!
Positive One killed my Uncle too the insanity needs to stop
Positive ............I  HAVE   NOT  KNOW  THE  LONG  DETAIL  ABOUT  THAT..................
Positive Make a deal with President Trump! I'm sure the United States can make the deal help the United Kingdom too. That's a great thing about being friends.
Negative What a horrible shame! And the taxpayers are saddled with paying for ALL the illegals living expenses! When is this going to end?!
Positive A guy came from Indiana to Sebring, Florida and shot and killed five woman.  We should build a wall to keep people from Indiana out of Florida
Positive Am so sorry for your loss.......
Negative And white American men have killed a MUCH larger number of Americans, but you don't see any mention of guns being a national emergency,  or nazis or white supremacists...
Positive Are Pelosi, Schumer others in Congress so cold hearted that they can't feel this pain of lives shattered?
Positive Yes, and there are many, many sad stories just like his.  It has to stop!
Positive Thank you for fighting for us every day!
Negative Build the wall from sea to sea.
Positive Donna Davis you laugh at a parents loss?
Negative The Rio Grande river is too long for a fence on rancher lands. There ARE some walls around cities on the river...so make them stronger.
Positive Absolutely....
Positive GO TRUMP !!
Negative Javoris JV Dubose I have to disagree with you I'm not sure what you're doing wrong is everybody in New York is getting a higher refund and last year. So you better find a new accountant even with New York high tax rate we are winning. Maybe you don't pay taxes I don't know why you post this
Negative BUILD THAT WALL MR. PRESIDENT
Positive Yes they do!!! Build that wall Mr. President
Positive Worked the border for 4 years, got shot at and could not fire back. The taxpayers paid the national guard a fortune to do absolutely nothing but be a pair of eyes. Border patrol gets sniped at quite often and sometimes killed. Is this what we all really want? If you dont want the wall go down there and see for yourself what it's like. You ever heard of the creative use of a chainsaw to cut a live human apart? You tube it. They arent all bad but which ones are? You willing to take that chance? I sure as hell am not. I see both sides of the argument but we should not take chances with the valuable human beings that we are trying to protect.
Negative Good John.. now call them up and tell them that Mr Trump's BILDERBERG GROUP terrorist organization is  bringing another herd of their slaves to their SOB Grand Masonic lodges..
Negative Joseph Roy  aaaaaa let see ,a door. Is trumpty  building a door now, a big black  bigly vanity door?  I am  sure Joe  if you wanted to you could break  my door down soooooo I  guess that wouldn't  stop you honey! Again 2019 what is wrong  with modern technology  instead of a bigly trumpty  vanity wall that Mexico isn't  paying for . Answer?
Positive hey scumbag you and your friends can write off your private jets but teachers can't write off a globe for their classroom you're an asshole
Negative By all means ignore facts showing they commit crimes less often than citizens.  Moron.
Positive Arturo Rosales ask the Democrats.  Since the large majority of mass shootings arw done by them!!
Positive My sincere sympathy goes to the father who lost his daughter by an illegal immigrant and to the angel moms and dads. Our congress men and women need to hear them instead of ignoring them.
Negative God bless President Trump,  America first
Negative Oh that really sad
Negative FINISH THE WALL WITH ELECTRIC THROUGH IT FOR SURE AND THE BEST DETECTORS  THAT IS MADE IN AMERICA ALL THE MATERIALS SHOULD BE. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THE BESTLEADER NOT ONLY IN AMERICA AND COUNTRIES AROUD THE WORLD ADMIRE YOU SIR AND PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ARE WAKING UP. I WISH ALL AMERICANS WILL DO THE SAME WAY.
Negative Someone supposed to have said something to me, and there is nothing there, hmm wonder what is going on .....
Positive A American kill my  Mother
Negative Carl Ostendarp and the leaders of their countrys are living it up while the people walk 1000 miles to break in here.  Why dont you go bitch about what their leaders are doing and fix their country so they wont need to come here
Negative dumoratts COULD CARE LESS ABOUT DEAD AMERICAN CITIZENS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Positive Trump.

Positive Ya my tax dollars going for a wall thats not going to stop them
Negative Yes president Trump build that wall. Dont back down.
Positive Shameful.exploitation of family pain. Now multiply that pain by the hundreds that have been killed in mass shootings by white males. Guess we should expell all young white males for these terrible crimes. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
Positive <3 God bless Angel Moms (& Dads)! <3
Negative its irrelevant whether the murderer was an illegal immigrant or not..
Negative This is how American citizens treat their children in our own country? https://www.abc15.com/national/texas-parents-arrested-after-young-children-found-locked-in-dog-cage-living-in-squalor
Positive So with the protections you signed after the emergency declaration do negate the wall?  Not seeing it
Positive If criminals use Ports of Entry. Why do they dig so many tunnels along the border?
Positive We MUST keep our country safe...
Negative Dante Noel Your some kind of special.
Positive Thank you mr. president for your dedication to kerping us safe. Sorry there are people out there who are so mean about you.
Positive Marjorie Anderson and the answer is?????????? Can YOU answer the question instead of acting like your cool aid master
Negative Sorry to hear... if the wall is already built and we have illegal immigrants inside of the country that is not the biggest problem because it is easy to find here inside the country and easy to deport...
Positive Getting rid of you will keep us safer than anything!
Positive ****"Simply What I See From These We MUST COMPLETE THE WALL....!!!! :) " ****  ****"May The Triple Gems Bless You All....!!!! :) " ****  ****"Our Jesus Bless You All....!!!! :) " ****
Negative John Fahrer vets will get help from the billions we spend every year on handouts to illegals.
Positive John N Karen Morris  I copied this thank you for posting it! Very good information!
Negative This wall thing is such an emergency that it will immediately be followed by golf.
Negative Ask prisoners if walls work.
Negative I with Trump
Positive Larry Lubiner it's already begun. I bet you're one of the same over confident tools that says there was no way Trump would be President to begin with. Keep speaking in your absolute never, we'll keep laughing at your stupidity. Under the declarations he used, they can't stop them in court. So,, coming soon to a border near you, a nice big 50 ft. barrier, complete with sharpened spikes at the top
Negative I guess it means nothing to you that when an illegal commits a murder in this country.......YES that is his focus and it should be.............
Positive Keep up the good work President Trump. Thank you for donating your paychecks, so I truly can mean it when I say thank you for your service.  PS My fondest memories of NYC involved my visits to the Trump Tower.
Positive I never imagined that we would literally have to fight our own government just to keep us safe .this new democrat party is out of control and they need stoped before they kill us all
Positive Dante Noel you are the one that needs help!
Positive How about all the other drunk drivers who are American losers? I understand that you are hurting but the Wall is not immigration policy.
Negative I refuse to argue with a myopic liberal moron, you will just drag me down and beat me with experience!  Illegal border jumper killers are everywhere, who knows maybe drunk in a car near you!
Positive Ron O'Hearn no need to save anything for me. I don't live in the world's most  moronic country,  thankfully  ...
Negative What if.   What if.     That is so stupid.   What if you're momma swallowed
Negative Build That Wall!!
Positive Yes I agree
Negative Why this dude head remind me of a thick booty bitch lol
Positive 85% of people who come in here illegally overstay their visas. And those people are Canadians. Why don't you build a wall on the northern border, you morons?
Negative Did someone say impeach Pelosi???
Positive People lives with no border is safe for new world
Negative please get Donald Jr. off the campaign   trail,,,,,,,OMG
Negative Places that have the strictest gun control measures have the most gun violence making it harder for law abiding citizens to have guns while criminals continue to get them however they please makes zero sense! It makes people less safer!
Positive https://www.facebook.com/TheOther98/photos/a.115969958413991/2503185179692445/?type=3&theater
Positive Jeff Sterup  I'm so sick of liberal stupidity.  Crime is a state issue.  This is a federal issue since it has to do with illegal immigration.   Stop voting Democrat, and your state will fair better.  Also, go back to school and educate yourself on state and federal issues.  You must have skipped government classes.
Positive California
Negative build the wall for get the dumocrat.
Positive Danny Jones we need our own Donald Trump! Hes the greatest President of all time
Positive Thank You for All The Hurt You Put Up With Mr President
Negative Boss congratulations for your presedent day I wish all the best for you and your family
Positive You have my condolences sir
Positive Adrianna Anders are Democrats taking money from the drug cartels politicians all see motivated by money over the best interest for Americans ,their position has no logic,with More than 70,200 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2017, including illicit drugs and prescription opioidsa 2-fold increase in a decade. ... Drug overdose deaths rose from 16,849 in 1999 to 70,237 in 2017. The bars are overlaid by lines showing the number of deaths by gender from 1999 to 2017 (Source: CDC WONDER).
Positive Only reason Obama was in office is cuz he was voted in illegally & Democrat knows it. He's anti-American & has been raised that way
Negative Then do Mandatory E-verifying if it is
Negative Majestica Arlene that's the most illogical and uninformed spew I've read in days!
Positive I support mr trump. It is a need the wall descition is great
Positive YES, BUILD THE WALL. AMERICA BE SAVE WITH THE WALL.
Positive Estefania Torres Restrepo so how does anyone accurately determine how many people or the amount of drugs have came into the US undetected?  That's right, you can't.  The argument of most/majority and legal ports of entry is just guesswork trying to be passed off as fact. A wall is a deterrent, along with the increased border enhancements.  They go hand in hand in preventing the illegal crossing of the border.  Come in legally, they are more than welcome.  Come in  illegally, no.   Opinions are not facts.
Positive Fight the good fight build that wall, Sir
Positive Mr. President, Americans cannot only be protected by building wall between America and Mexico. There are other means through which this can be done. Stop putting pressure on public purse
Positive Amen, more killings by illegals, than we have been told.
Positive Jeanie Railsback  Al-Bashir is killing the unarmed demonstrators by live bullets Al-Bashir is a dictatorship that oppresses people in satellite channels. The uniform is owned in Sudan. Bashir is holding people in detention camps until death. Join us in the intifada to gain our
Negative So sorry that happened! It never should have happened!
Positive Thank you Mr. President
Positive Thank you, President Trump for putting America first.
Positive Yet nothing about the 30,000 plus gun deaths caused by American citizens every year. 
Positive I cant wait until the next president  a Democrat  calls a national  emergency  for the health care crisis in the USA. Finally something  will get done to help the American  people. Thank you President  Trump for setting the precedent.  And, oh by the way the next Democrat  president  will  also be able to declare a national  emergency  and ban guns that kill people when there is the next school  shooting.  Thank you again president  Trump for making  America great again! You alone have changed America  forever
Positive Veronica:  You are a liar. You have never been to London and that didnt happen.
Negative Democrats only want your vote, not your safety. BUILD THE WALL.
Positive Eddie Gonzalez poor me? Your sarcasm shows your intelligence, and that you have none. Im advocating for families who lost their loved ones, not myself. I was lucky to just come out alive with only injuries.
Positive That's simply silliness. How many white, males have killed, maimed, tortured other U.S. citizens? Can we deport them too? No, we build prison walls and once they are released or escape or die, we consider it justice served. We don't blame the entire white, male race, do we? This is simply another example of you race hating.
Positive Danny Jones factually you are tiny man
Negative Katy Chavez yeah sis because mexicans are the ones illegally crossing the boarder  yall stay on your own fuckin side and it wouldnt be a problem to begin with. duh
Positive Always President Donald Trump and Melania first lady God bless.  The wall will be build.
Positive So sorry for your loss sir . We stand behind you and we mourn with you
Positive Beto knows the truth.
Positive 9/11 was a national emergency. This is a two year effort to live up to a campaign promise that you could not deliver. Mexico paying hahaha
Negative Kelly Anders hopefully you realize that not all illegal immigrants are brown.  Also, what does being gay have to do with your fear of white men?  I probably don't understand the issues you face because #1 I'm straight and #2 a person's life choices, sexuality, political affiliation, skin color, etc aren't really things I think about when I meet someone or pass them on the street.  My first impression of people is usually based on whether they are polite and pleasant or have a chip on their shoulder and a crappy attitude.  Other than that, I personally don't go throughout my daily life in fear of much.  I do believe that illegal immigration is a problem in the United States.
Positive Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin  3) American Income   ~Median household income rose to $61,372 in 2017, a post-recession high.  ~Wages up in August by their fastest rate since June 2009.  ~Paychecks rose by 3.3 percent between 2016 and 2017, the most in a decade.  ~Council of Economic Advisers found that real wage compensation has grown by 1.4 percent over the past year.  ~Some 3.9 million Americans off food stamps since the election.  ~Median income for Hispanic-Americans rose by 3.7 percent and surpassed $50,000 for the first time ever in history. Home-ownership among Hispanics is at the highest rate in nearly a decade. Poverty rates for African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans have reached their lowest levels ever recorded.

Negative Mike Mandel that was in his initial package that Nancy said no to.  Geeze, dont you people ever pay attention?
Positive Wall wall wall Trump fart you will be buried under southern walls stop crying wall wall
Negative Many States have a 2x - 3rd jail. It helps until someone gets out. It's an addiction and needs treated as such. But it takes like all addictions. The addict has to work hard at staying sober for life. It's a decision with prayers. Illegals need to stay out of America period. They should be tried for murder ..
Negative America first! Trump 2020!
Positive You are so right. God Bless your daughter.
Positive Hopefully Gov. you won't wind up with the blood of the good people of California on your own hands.

Negative i'm tired of the hypocritical BS coming from the left. Just build the freaking wall already. get it done. it's been labeled as a crisis for 30 years, primarily by democrats. but not today. stand your ground Mr. President!
Positive Edgar D. GutierrezTexas is the only state to track crime specifically among illegal immigrants let's use them as an example:  Between January 2011- January 2019 there have been 10 school shootings in the state of Texas. Of those 10 shootings 15 people have died and 28 have been injured.   Now let's look at crime amongst illegal immigrants in Texas. "Between June 1, 2011 and January 31, 2019, 189,000 illegal aliens were charged with more than 295,000 criminal offenses. DPS criminal history records reflect those criminal charges have thus far resulted in over 120,000 convictions including 238 HOMICIDE convictions; 13,662 assault convictions; 3,158 burglary convictions; 17,930 drug convictions; 175 kidnapping convictions; 7,100 theft convictions; 11,336 obstructing police convictions; 1,013 robbery convictions; 1,710 sexual assault convictions; 1,153 sexual offense convictions; and 1,282 weapon convictions."  That's just one state.
Negative Someone stole one of my favorite dogs. Sometimes I'm really pissed off. Other days I'm sad.  I miss my dog.

Positive Renieri Ortiz Illegals aren't immigrants you absolute fool.
Negative Build the wall, please!!!
Negative Maybe Trump should have thought before signing that awful budget bill...
Positive THE BEUTIFUL WALL IS ALREADY BEING BUILT GOD BLESS THE GREAT PRESIDENT TRUMP.
Negative Renieri Ortiz illegal is the word you need to research. ILL LE GULL (that's the pronunciation). Let's stick to the topic.
Negative We know walls work, ask the DEMONCRATS! How do they survive day to day? Their walls seem to be working!
Positive Right, because we make policy based on people's stories, not science and actual statistics.
Negative Raise the cost of the "work in America visa" . Then you can say Mexico paid for it.
Negative Valerie Siggson idiot
Negative Sympathies to the family but the odds of her being killed by a mass shooter in school, or by a drunk American are statistically higher than what happened here.   The courts failed long before he got to her.   There is nothing in these articles that say why he was illegal, just that he was suspected of being illegal.  Did he overstay a visa?  Is he a DACA kid?    Too many unknowns.
Positive Both partys want the wall ,Just dont want Trump to succeed.
Positive And how many illegals would you want in your house without your permission?!
Negative Why does in cost $2500 out of my pocket in two weeks going to a doctor to be set up for high blood pressure medicine. I have insurance. Can you work on that one or do i need to vote democrat nrxt time. You promised and failed to deliver.
Negative Bill Johnson... trump cares only for trump ...
Negative Joan Hamilton it doesn't matter why he was illegal.  The fact that he had no legal right to be here is enough!
Positive So sorry for your terrible loss..
Positive Chris Weiss   You Fool!!!!  You may know the skin color because that's the first thing LIBERALS notice! But you have no IDEA whether they were Christian or not!!! Of course, unless you're writing a book and have researched and talked to the families, friends, churches they've attended, basically gathering evidence, facts, quotes from family members, friends, pastors of the churches these White males attended in order to write a book dealing with the mass shootings that occurred in 2017!!!   I know you're not a writer! I know you haven't researched this claim you've made of their religious background!  So why don't you SHUT UP and quit using this asinine claim to bash CHRISTIANITY!!  We have enough of that going on in our country today!!!!!
Positive The biggest problem in America is NOT illegal immigrants, its illiterate imbeciles, better known as TRUMP supporters
Positive Margo Smith really?  Where do you get that information?  Did you know 50% of the violent crime in America is committed by 13% of the population.  That 13% ain't white.
Positive Build the wall...NOW! Please!
Negative Jennifer Yvonne Croff and your point is?
Negative Christopher Thompson I think most of the opposition is because these people know it will work .
Positive You did the right thing.
Negative Other demo.

Negative An illegal immigrant killed a friend of mine.  He was driving without a license and ran a stop sign.  My friend on his motorcycle hit the side of the van and was killed instantly.  He had no license, fictitious tags, and no insurance.  his wife was pregnant with their son who will never know his father.  NJ being a SHITHOLE sanctuary state did NOTHING about it!  He was arrested and released.  Build that wall before WE THE PEOPLE START KILLING THESE ILLEGALS!
Negative Maximus Herrera what exactly?
Positive To everyone saying you can't blame him because of his immigration status, why not? Yes technically it happened because he was drunk but imagine if he had never even been here in the first place? I completely support immigration, if you do it legally!!
Positive Finish that wall!!!
Negative George Winn they offered 45 25 billion in 2018. He couldnt art of the deal that?  Come on. Hes a loser.

Positive BUILD THE WALL....lets get started...
Negative if my taxes go to building a wall it better be a wall around you and your supporters. there are plenty other things that need to be fixed over and before a wall and yet you ignore them congrats you don't care about america (mexico is america btw also canada as well you are thinking of the united states families not american families) you care about yourself
Negative Correct. So why wouldn't we slow down the invaders. You want to immigrate here do it the legal way. Real simple.
Negative May God Let Her Rest in Peace! Please the Wall!
Negative Trump is a lying crook. If you believe what Trump says you're a SUCKER
Negative Go,go Don, build that wall mate. Wish we could in the UK.
Positive While living in Chandler AZ...I was viciously raped by an illegal immigrant @ knifepoint in my own house after he broke in.
Negative None of those are good arguments however our underprotected border is a good argument and for all the reasons you just listed along with many others. Our gov is starting to deal with American problems yet we fight them....should be excited that we are trying to do something for America.and encourage it so that it may continue.
Positive They have no right to be on American soil.  They do not respect the U.S. Then we have to pay for their babies.  Legals do it right.
Negative Karl Hesford go to Chicago if you want the safty of gun control  !
Positive BUILD THE WALL Donald J. Trump
Positive Mr. President, keep up the great work! I'm totally behind you and support everything you have done and are doing for America! Finally, a President who cares for the well being, safety, and security of our country! Continue to stand strong, don't waiver, and keep on winning for America. We're not tired of winning yet!
Positive John N Karen Morris  sombody report me like that thanks to them now Im legal here jajajjaja
Positive I hope nobody invents tunnel technology.
Positive Yes. I know what you mean. Time helps in some ways but not really. Every day without them gets harder too in many ways. It isn't like movies where it's a big emotional upset and then everyone moves on. Everyone around you has moved on but a big part of your heart is left in the past. Rachael was my dearest friend. I didn't know that until the night she died. The valley of the Shadow of Death is a dark place but there are so many wonderful people in there with us to encourage us along the way. It isn't a place we would ever choose to be, but here we are.
Positive Mr.President America proud of you !!
Negative I am so sorry for your loss..
Negative Sorry for your loss sir.  True Americans are standing with our president to keep America safe.
Negative It already is addressed as it is illegal to drink and drive.
Negative 20 six year olds died at Sandyhook Elementary school, all at once.
Positive The sick idiots who are laugh reacting this post are the problem. Let's exchange them for legal immigrants. Give the immigrants all of their possessions, jobs, and money and send them to a shiihole counrty of their choosing.

Positive so sorry for your lost
Positive I bet he is not a democrat.
Positive She is so beautiful! Why why why ?
Negative I can't imagine how it must feel to have lost your child to an invader and to have all the media and the US Congress care more for the invaders, than your child.   And then the one man who has shown any concern, the President of the US, betrays you by signing a bill that will flood the country with more illegals.  Shame on you Mr. President, shame on you for signing that atrocious bill.
Positive Patti Cullen You confuse Trump with Obama. He thought he was above everyone and everything.
Negative Americans buy the drugs. Who is the problem? Lol
Positive Shut up youre annoying !!!
Negative I'm so sorry. I pray you will somehow be able to survive all the heartbreaking dynamics of  this absolutely horrible loss of your precious son. The Democrats have gone mad, and this is causing us so much grief and worry. My heartbreaks for you and your family, and I pray for you all and our country.
Positive Terri Reeves well I dont know much about Chicago but I know that here, in Canada, there are probably only as much murders in a year than in Chicago alone, maybe less
Positive Sad thing is the Democrats don't care !  Vile !

Positive I am sorry for your loss and Please keep fighting for the cause.
Negative All these comments about white people hurt my feelings, I guess I'll go clean my guns since their way more important in these CIVIL times!!
Negative Re: Aurora. I could ask? Why so many murders in or near Chicago, in spite of strict gun laws?   And was does that have to do with wall, and the border, which is a completely different issue. There is no connection, or solution, common to the two.
Negative Build the wall and make Democrats pay for it.
Negative Bill Johnson   You should be saying make America sane again.  Not to worry,  With proper therapeutic intervention you will some day come to terms with the realization of having betrayed your country at the ballot box, handing it over to a Russian crime syndicate headed by a mentally and emotionally damaged New York City gangster.
Negative Charlesetta Brown please provide the name and address of your loved one for the next death cause by an illegal!!
Positive Kevin Peevey  no... that won't stop natural US citizens from drinking and driving and causing fatal accidents... it's only a news story because he was an illegal immigrant... if it was a white guy it would have been a completely normal occurrence

Positive You are right and I am always on your side.
Negative shut the hell you ignorant pussy grabber backer this is exactlly what you all done to President Obama so suck it up butter cup
Positive Crime has no color. Hate and resentment only bring more turmoil. Trust in God. Not in a wall or Trump.
Positive Build the wall immediately
Positive I live in Southern California a little west of Palm Springs and I say any City or State that becomes a Sanctuary City or Sanctuary State, thereby not enforcing Immigration Law, now can NOT enforce ANY Law. No one can be arrested for rape, robbery, assault, murder, etc., because that would be picking and choosing which Laws to enforce and which Laws to not enforce. The Employers who hire illegals, the Judges, Congressmen, Prosecutors, Mayors, Governors, and Church-Sanctuary People of those cities and states should be held accountable and arrested as accomplices for aiding and abetting illegals, and endangering the lives of United States Citizens. Yes, it IS that simple.
Negative A warrior. Unless it's raining. Or if his bone spurs aren't acting up.
Positive President Trump has my full support. Build that wall!

Negative When I ask my self this question. About the wall. And weight out all the pros and cons. I came up with this.  I had a daughter. That was involved in. Human trafficking. She did not even know she was doing it. Because of the drugs and the influence. It had on her. She call us. And wanted to come home for a few days. I knew she was a prostitute. And it was hard to just think that some day Im going to get a phone call. From the police. Saying your daughter is dead. In my heart. Was a broken heart. To think what she was doing. She was MIA. Then out of the blue she called. I asked her questions. How are you. When are you going to come home. She would not say nothing. Out of shame. I would begin to cry. She would say dad dont cry. This is my choice. So I asked her this. What are you doing right now.  She told me. She was at the bus stop. To pick up some girls. From New York. I asked why. Because her pimp wanted her to. I told her. That is human trafficking. She said whats that. And I told her. What human trafficking is. And what happens to girls. She took the girls to a safe house. And she had to stay with them until the pimps. Muscle guys. Came and took him away. She told me they were 12 to 15-year-olds. She never saw those girls again after that night when the muscleman came and took them.  If a wall just stops one of these acts and prevent someone from getting killed from drugs to me its worth having the wall. If they cant come to America legally then they should not come at all does it read those their grandparents or someone they know that wanted to come to America had to either come here legally or illegally. Lives matters. And walls will save lives.
Positive BUILD THE WALL MR. TRUMP.
Positive For those who think there's no problem at the border...lend me your ear for a first hand story we heard today.  My son's  truck was stolen in San Antonio. Two weeks later they found it in Larado.  The sheriff said the seats are missing.  They take them out to fit more people to bring them across the border. They like the 4 wheel drives so they can drive through the ranches.  He said they get 200 stolen cars a day like this. Not 2 but 200!!! Multiply that by as many as they can stuff in the truck without any seats. Now multiply that by 365 days in a year.  Now tell me there's  no problem at the border and I will tell you you're crazy. Build the wall!!! I'm over it!!
Positive We need to start by getting the Democrats out of office !
Negative on and on-yes we have a national emergency- BUILD THE WALL
Positive Melissa Lamphere so what you're saying then is you want to foster/sponsor a family of illegals? Now remember no background check of any kind. Just open your door. Let'em right in to your home. I love how awesome of a person you are.
Negative ohh Jess still in the mood ,,Us and Them,,. Like they are subhumans. Even if some of Them are responsable for terorist atacks like in Paris 2015 ,Madrid 2003 or London 2005 we Europeans still living in relative peace with Them. Them = ilegal imigrants as u  name them. And we have Shenghen space=free Borders between countries.
Negative Fear mongering douchebag
Positive He drove they let him across. The border patrol is part of the problem wall wont work Military
Negative Wait til one of them crazy gun toting bastards shoot your ass
Positive Amen death penalty for those who kill our citizens
Negative So what are you going to do about to do about your own murdering citizens Mr Trump, throw them over the wall
Negative It's about time to put the fucking baboons in check! Sick of all the squabbling! We need a wall asap and those who disagree can leave this country! Why do people have locks on doors? To keep the ones that don't belong out.
Negative Robert Dahlquist very good point. And very true! That's why as Servers, we are trained and certified about these things since we can be held responsible.
Positive He should be able to have an eye for an eye
Positive Geoffrey Hostens so you wouldn't feel the same if she was ugly? Shame on you!
Positive Use the Drug Cartels money to build  the Wall!Amen +++
Positive Thank you Best President in my time.  MAGA
Positive 5 private citizens were killed at work in Aurora, Illinois on Friday. 5 police officers were injured while subduing the gunman, who was also killed.  The gunman was an employee who was being terminated.  His Illinois gun permit was pulled because he had a conviction in Mississippi, and the gun he purchased under that permit should have been confiscated.  This is a national emergency.  Five families in one day, lost a son, husband, father, brother, etc., killed by an American citizen who should not have had a gun.  39,000 people were killed by guns in our country last year.  That is a national emergency.
Positive Democrats only care about illegals.
Positive Mr. President we have been going to build a wall since Clinton! I support you being a real American President and getting it done!!!!!! The hoards are forming and are on their way!!!
Negative If they truly don't work, as Liberals suggest then why are they so against them?
Negative We need more posts like this.  News only reports about not wanting the wall. Never about the American people wanting it. That's why trump was voted in.  I am sure if it was one of those loud mouth reporters on television that lost a loved one they would be singing a different tune.   Or the Democrats in office.  I was a Democrat,switched over to Republican when trump was  running.
Positive So sad. Up with the wall
Negative It should resigning as your highest priority.  You are an old senile sad old man
Positive Jess Castrejn thats why he donated his salary to studying alcoholism. Action speak louder than words
Positive Estefania Torres Restrepo The southern border might as well be considered a port of entry. Cause they sure as heck enter through it. We cant just have open desert between the two countries where people are free to roam back and forth.
Positive We are behind you!  Build that wall  !!!
Negative I support you, Mr. President. I pray for you every day.
Negative A border wall won't bring back the dead folks who have been killed by home grown American citizens or by illegal immigrants (who may have come in through an airport).  It is despicable to exploit peoples' personal tragedies for political reasons.
Positive Whatever u do in life, please think about safety first. I wish African Leaders can start acting like mr Trump. Mostly Nigeria
Positive Thank you President Trump!! God Bless you and this country!!!

Demonizing a whole group of people for the crimes voting for Trump  is never justifiable. are Democrats taking money from the drug cartels politicians all see motivated by money over the best interest for Americans ,their position has no logic,with More than 70,200 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2017, including illicit drugs and prescription opioidsa 2-fold increase in a decade. ... Drug overdose deaths rose from 16,849 in 1999 to 70,237 in 2017. The bars are overlaid by lines showing the number of deaths by gender from 1999 to 2017 (Source: CDC WONDER).
Positive prayers for your family
Positive It is so sad that a leader would use the personal tragedies of a relatively small number of Americans to stoke fear in lots of Americans.  Perfection, in anything, cannot be obtained and sustained. We humans simply are not capable of perfection.  During Trumps Presidency to date, far more kids have been killed 8n their schools that Americans who have been killed by folk in our country illegally.  Seems like a greater emergency to me.....

Positive That's true!!!!!
Negative If that wall saves 1 ONE, American life from being a victim of these illegal border jumpers it is worth every dime!
Positive Build the wall Tell Nancy to suck a bag of onions

Negative Jeanie, you should've "kept your doctor".
Negative These socialist love chaos. If we dont put down Socialism we will be in trouble real soon
Positive Trump lacks certain qualities which are appreciated by good and decent people. He has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace.  He is a bully.  That is, except when he is among bullies like Putin; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling boot licker instead. The rules of basic decency cannot be found in Trump. He punches downwards  which a gentleman should, would, could never do  and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless  and he kicks them when they are down. The fact that a third of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think Yeah, he seems like my kind of guy is a matter of confusion and distress to people worldwide. There have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid. As reported in Japanese newspapers, Trump specifically asked Japanese PM Abe to nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize.    Twice before he submitted forged nominations on his own behalf because he is so desperately jealous of Obama.    How embarassingly sad is that?   Trump will never ever get a Nobel Peace Prize because he creates chaos and strife every single day....the opposite of peace.

Positive Erin Salgado seriously? Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher.
Positive I mourn your loss. However, declaring a national crisis and putting up a concrete wall will never solve America's immigration issues. Ronald Reagan once said  "Mr. Gorbachev, Tear Down This Wall. Bottom line, this is pure politics. It's all about satisfying his extreme right wing tea party base. Let the experts decide how best to solve our border issues. America is a democracy, not a dictatorship. The president continues to make up things and lie to the American people.

Negative trump's uneducated, low-IQ base is triggered by stories like this that ignore the facts. Illegal immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than native-born Americans, and a wall would do nothing to stop the flow of illegal drugs. There is no "crisis" at the border. Illegal crossings are at historic lows.

Negative Yeah i can see how touched you are demonrat  you are so blind by the fake news media and by the demonrat party that you can't see how much things he has accomplished
Positive Dear Mr. President Trump, At first, I was a bit skeptical about having a business man run for president when I believed you had little knowledge of politics. Then you began to open my eyes to the corruption that as been in the White House for far too long. Like all business men, your main concern is to protect the company which he has invested into (that being the people of the USA). If walls don't work, then why do we fence in our backyards? (To protect our children from the known dangers of the outside world.) Why do we fence in cattle when it seems inhumane to force an animal to a restricted area? (To protect the investment of their owners and others from harm). Why do we fence in our public schools? (To protect innocent children from savage people who wish unnecessary violence against the future of America). Why do we build retaining walls around our house? (To stop mother nature from destroying our shelter, our home). Why do we build walls around freeways and areas of high traffic? (To protect each other from the negligence of other drivers and to protect our people from hit and runs). Why do we build railings on our bridges? (To protect people from the dangers of failing far far below). Your interest is direct and logical. Let's protect the American people from the dangers of our Southern boarder before the danger/crime/violence happens (Still a little late because there are many of Americans who have lost love ones due to not having a wall). Democrats are doing everything in their power to stop you, don't let them! They are after the votes of the illegals, not the protection of their citizens! You sir will most likely be the greatest president in my lifetime. Opening America's eyes one day at a time. Wake up or fall victim to the violence and destruction the Democratic party wants. Keep fighting for the American people, it's been a honor to have you for a president sir!!! #TRUMP2020
Positive so agree, get it built.
Negative Wake Up America.

Positive Awesome idea. Whos going to take your place?
Negative Wall wont stop it from happening.

Negative They need to make a trench along the wall on r side about 10ft deep and 10ft wide, fill with rattle snake and when they go over or under well; let just say the snakes will welcome them to the USA!!!! LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Positive Sorry and sad for your lost we definitely need to man up with the wsll
Positive Walls work , thats why we all have one around our houses! Make complete sense!
Positive 5 people died yesterday out of a machine gun in illinois that's the emergency Mr President assault weapons,your border emergency is crap made up in your head
Negative Too bad it wasn't PELOSI'S or Schumer's kid...sad for these parents
Positive Liberals are crazy nutty dumbass people

Positive MR President, I would be honored to serve as security for our country on the border.
Negative Jordan Miller have you ever thought about the fact that the driver was drunk? He was obviously going very fast if he hit her that hard and some terrains make it hard to see when people are coming down the street. Shame on you for having absolutely no soul and saying it was her fault.
Negative Danny Jones One angel family does not a crisis make!!!!  Trump declares national emergency...  Nobodys done the job that weve done on the border,  said Donny as he declares a national emergency today........the slowest emergency in history.  And with the lawsuits that will ensue, his wall will not be funded or built until after the next election...if ever.  THE WORLDS SLOWEST EMERGENCY!!!!!  Donny lied directly to Americans about his border crisis.  Our Liar-in-Chief said that all the data that refutes his crisis designation is lies.  Got that?  Our president told the American people that THE FACTS ARE LIES...this is what all wannabe dictators say.  This egomaniac is THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!  Donny doesnt seem terribly concerned about this crisis.  He plans to travel to Florida mere hours after declaring the emergency from the White House. A president, in times of strife, would typically stay in the nations capital to oversee the crisis. Donny plans to do so from the comfort of his weekend getaway.  In reality, Donny is preparing the country for a fake war as he plans to enjoy a mini vacation. The only national emergency in America right now is one of leadership!!
Positive Thank you ! I appreciate everything you do !
Positive We would not need walls if we were not in the need of penitentiary terms !!
Positive if the Senators and the state doesn't want the wall built let's put their houses down there along the border it for the governors in the Senators to live in and then let's see if they want to build the wall
Negative Perry Hess sure lol most republiCONS are gun owners not dems retard
Negative Albert J Destefanis he is the swamp
Positive U might want to look at your gun problem as something requiring the recognition of a national emergency before letting a wall jump the que... u do know thats not the only way they get in?
Negative Never Never a Wall
Positive Did Daniel Zuniga illegally cross the border on foot in an area we dont currently have walls or come here legally and over stay their Visa?
Positive God bless you Donald Trump. In Nigeria my country, the president value cows more than humans, the reason why we want him out.
Negative we don't , we just know spending $25 BILLION on a wall will  NOT stop people entering the country illegally ,  most illegals are visa over stayers but trump is not addressing that he just wants a wall to keep votes off morons like you two
Positive God bless you President Trump! Trump 2020
Negative No trump is wrong and he can not be trusted to tell the truth any longer. Thousands of Illegal immigrant's cross the boarder at our check points every week right now, it just takes cash and a connection, a longer wall in the desert will not help at all.
Negative Craig Peterson what American problems because of Americans.  Hmmmmmm?
Positive this is happening WAY too often!
Positive Emil Drr he's not going to prison, it will be too full of Obama and his entire administration.
Positive Nice God blass You famly
Positive Mr. Trump you're a beautiful Angel of the Lord with hair as Golden as my Sunrise.
Negative Yes Mr Trump. Protect Americans first. Even the Dumbacraps that can only Take from the American people. Then lets move on to more issues like big pharma and infrastructure. One thing at a time. You have 6 more yrs and its going to be a battle with the obstructing we know.
Negative Does God not like Mexico then? Is he only helping America?
Negative The house will fall
Negative If you build a wall, illegal immigrants will come with a boat. And boat owners will make huge money by human trafficking, some poor illegal immigrant children will die by drowning, because boat owners will receive more people than the capacity. Another drama will start. Do you really want this? In other countries this is happening. wall is not the solution..
Positive So horrible!!  100%!!  Build the wall!
Positive Because are people too
Positive YES BUILD THE WALL NO MORE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
Positive TRUMP 2020
Positive It is not an iligal immigrant, it is an illegal criminal that crossed our boarder. California state government should be charged with harboring these criminals. Take their statehood away and put them back in territory status.
Positive Stacey Britton you mean showing proof that we need border security?
Negative America is truly a fucked up place. Thousands of Americans are shot by other Americans. You do nothing about gun control but are happy to spend millions to keep a handful of criminals out rather than deal with the ones youve already got.
Positive I support the President and the wall
Positive God bless you Donald Trump.
Positive Listen, Santa....
Positive YES!!!
Positive Charles Boyd JFC another delusional one who believes in the communist utopia of no guns except for the govt will keep us safe BS. Guess what- the govt doesnt give a damn about you. You are a liability to them and liabilities are expendable. Learn your history boy.
Negative So far as I can tell, its only the democrats that does not want the wall. There are some that keeps asking me about it.
Negative When Democrats dismiss the fact that illegal immigrants are killing citizens , they are really admitting that there is an acceptable number of victims. I think they would feel differently if it were their family member who wound up a victim. That is completely unacceptable.
Negative Does any one else find the photo strange? The man doesn't even look human
Negative I'm so sorry for your loss!
Negative Deport all immigrants they are all trouble we can do without.
Positive So it is a competition?! One is not as bad as the other?! It matters when some son-of-a-bitch guns you down?! What an asshat! What part of ILLEGAL ALIEN border jumper, who is not supposed to be here to begin with, do you not get?! As in if the illegals were not here they could not kill anyone you mental midget! This has to be the most ridiculous, stupid comment I have ever read!
Negative Go camping at the border with your kid I dare you
Positive Jess Castrejn MAD is a group who does address this #MOTHERSAGAINSTDRUNKDRIVERS.
Positive Sam North Obviously we can keep out our own citizens idiot but we can keep out Illegals! Did you even read how stupid your post sounded before you posted it? Did you mom tell you as she put you on the little yellow bus every morning that it was for the smarter kids at your school Sam? Like wow?
Negative And they have consequences.  They do get deported so they can come right back and do it again.  Maybe if we took care of Americans and focused on mental health, we could save some lives.  There's an idiot idea
Positive Thank you.
Positive Jason O'neal  A lot just cross the desert, usually the really bad ones with records too
Negative It's better to look into this Trump.  Before things get out of hand
Positive Take a good look at that. It's not just extreme christian humility. It's a world paradigm of caring and sharing.
Positive BUILDTHEWALL
Positive This is sickening, then to hear Schumer and Pelosi say the border is not a crisis for our country !!!!!!!!!!
Negative Go tell her parents that Adrian Vargas
Negative Drunk driver killed my friend...crush all vehicles except Ambulances and Fire Trucks
Positive Make no mistake, Trump couldn't care less about Americans.  You're a fool if you believe his lies.
Negative You're lying stop it.
Positive Danny Jones you know what else the UK can get with $5 billion? A decent dental plan for all of its citizens. Maybe you should worry about that first, and let us worry about our wall.
Positive Charlesetta Brown Illegal entry is criminal.They can go through legal channels!
Negative thank you President Trump!
Positive Thank you Mr President sir
Positive Absolutely.
Negative There were 323 mass killings in America in 2018.  Not a single one was committed by a person who had entered the country illegally.  You are being conned.
Positive Australia loves  President Trump keep up the good work
Positive Estefania Torres Restrepo not if we get enough ice agents to round them up and throw them the hell out of here
Positive George Brakey They can't compete with what he's done in alittle over 2 years with jobs,Korea,taxes oil production lowest unemployment! All Dems can do is try to stop him from winning at his promise of border security  as a win for themselves!
Negative The constant false alarm calls from all you Trumpanzees must be fucking hilarious!
Positive If it saves one life!
Positive You people need to believe the experts and not lying Trump.    A Border Wall isn't the answer. Most illegal immigrants overstayed their VISAS or entered through legal points of entry.
Negative Yea well my dad was killed by one of them also. I was very young at the time.  My sisters brother and I suffered along with my poor mom. She was only 27.  Bulid that dam wall. And do something about all those kids they are having. Just to be able to stay here.  And have us support them.  While they stay home poping  kids out.
Positive This is a tragic story but the fact remains that immigrants commit crimes at about half the rate of people born in this country. Trying to use a tragedy like this to score political points is tasteless and holding up this as a way to impugn all immigrants is disingenuous
Positive James Lewis Jackson Meanwhile as black me get gunned down by white cops.....crickets from SCROTUS!
Positive Chris Policronis what information specifically would you like
Positive Margaret Charlton get your ignorance out of your ears. There are more factors than a simple statement to blame immigration status or lack there of. There is no actual evidence that this accident occurred because of immigration status. Peoples simple logic of well, if they where not here in the first place does not pass any body of proof tests. Theses are the facts. Someone was drinking. Someone drove a truck. Someone died. Saying this was caused from them being here illegally is not evidence. Its opinion. Saying if they where not here in the first place is conjecture. I have far beyond a GED.
Negative Dedrick Jordan   Seek help.
Negative So sad.   Our President is absolutely right on this issue, as he has been on so many issues before.  Support Our President, and support our Border Wall to safeguard our Nation.
Negative A walk MUST be built. Maybe some of the liberals that are against the wall should have one of their children or a family member killed/murdered by one of these illigal immigrants. Just maybe they would change their mind and be supportive in building this so needed wall.
Negative Just remember how el chapo manage to transport so many drugs around the world lol . He even built a tunnel . Wont stop lol not every criminal is illegal
Positive So sorry!
Positive Build the wall Mr President.  Then abolish the IRS , FBI and CIA. Next lock up all members of Congress and any other Politicians that break their constitutional oath to office . Reduce their salary to $25,000 a year , give them term limits and since they want our guns so bad , stop them from being allowed armed security . You have done a great job President Trump.  Now if we could just bring down the prices of everything in this price gouging , hyper inflated Society , so those of us that live below poverty level , could affird to live once again !!
Negative Bill, Mr. trump is compromised and has proven himself to be an asset of The Russian Federation. Remember when Mr. trump advocated on behalf of Russia at The G7 in Canada? Why are we having a meeting without Russia being in the meeting? And I would recommend and its up to them, but Russia should be in the meeting and should be a part of it. former NBC celebrity game show host Mr. trump - 06/08/18 Why is this not a bigger story? That is not normal! Why not Brazil? Brazils economy is far larger than Russias. Russia is no longer a part of The G7 because it invaded its neighbor Ukraine in 2014! This is not a drill! This is serious stuff! Mr. trump is a national security risk. Im correct on this matter. 
Negative Adam Corria well make the boarder control do theirs and stop bitching!!! Where is all this love for America? Their are kids getting poisoned! Lol the man keeps lying to you  dumb ass eating up
Negative Paul Seldes and the Shooters was not Immigrants this was Trumpees the right Wing Idiots.
Negative I'm british and my Visa expired. I dare someone to report me!

Negative How does  a wall  stop anyone? Reply trumpty dumpty followers ! Simple question!
Positive IN JESUS CHRIST NAME AMEN
Negative If the wall saves one innocent life it is worth every penny
Positive So sad this keeps happening to Angel Moms and Dads!
Positive BUILD THAT WALL !!!
Negative youre an idiot
Positive Ward Karsman Well, let's just do a fact check on ONE of your list...Robert Byrd was honored by the NAACP after his death, because of his tireless work for civil rights.  I understand English can be tough when its not your native language, so let me explain that NAACP is an acronym -it's made up of the first letters of the words in the title of an organization- meaning "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People".
Positive So very sorry for the loss of your beautiful daughter. The blood of all these deaths is on Nancy and Ch ucks hand. Praying for your peace.
Positive Shared
Negative MAGA!
Negative  I am so sorry for this man & his family! Praying for their healing  I WILL continue to pray for God to guide, direct , protect our President Mr Trump! 
Positive Marxist Communist left sit on the left to destroy all socialist progress to overthrow capitalism. They never have a socialist agenda ever!!!! Karl Marx was Jewiish and a cousin to the Rothchilds bankers.
Positive Right
Positive I am not American but I had always been your fan for the fine person you are. I think people must trust in your decisions. The government has to protect its people and the president must do whatever is in his reach to help with that. I would be proud to have you as my president. God bless you and your people.
Positive Border emergency what a hoax
Positive Americans kill Americans all the time. Hell I bet the damn police kill more innocent people than any so called undocumented immigrants
Positive We can t blame the vulgar or bad feelings of the most people for our deceptions.....they are what they can .....but we must live and fight for God Amrica and all people deserves to live with moral respeat and true love in GOD for Amrica!!!!!!
Negative Sorry for all your losses and yes 100 % with the idea of the wall !!!! R.I.P to all who were killed by evil
Negative Alberto Weisz Im no fool. I know a door gates and fences do nothing to keep anyone out of my house.
Positive Hal Eric Mitlitsky  hes been trying to get out of this job since he was elected.
Positive Thank you Sir
Positive Ughhhhhhh
Positive You gave up too much in this deal! Immigration will be increased and we will suffer the consequences more!
Positive You  can  blame  governor  Newsome  and  polos  of it
Negative James Campbell how many die because of a car ?why arent you screaming about banning cars .more gun laws isnt going to stop it .
Negative President Trump, respectfully I implore you to quit taking all this gruff from the democrats and their far left wing. Please release the documents that you promised to unseal. You need to expose the lawless left and if so those on the right! If you actually see these messages help America help you make it great again, expose Washington for who they are!
Positive We must build the wall not only for todays citizens but for future generations..Thank you President Trump for striving to get the USA back to a nation of integrity...Thank you and God bless
Negative Keith Webber Jr. You get Lego Stones Troll. Than you can bulit when you finished with work  Wall , das and Night  Low Minded naive Brain Limited Trumpee
Negative How many sons and daughters has trump killed
Negative Marcos Ramirez I guess his accomplishments mean nothing, its cool just wake up with hate in your heart and MSN in your ears
Negative Ive been following the whole Build the Wall debate the best I can & I would like to voice my opinion. Why on earth would American citizens NOT want to protect their country?? I cant figure that out. People need to set aside their feelings about President Trump & Congress & strip the debate down to what the issue is. This is keeping America safe, plain & simple. I really dont care if its a wall, border agents, cameras, whatever.  Put the bickering aside & just DO SOMETHING! We protect our homes, our possessions; why not our country? This is where we LIVE people! Such stupidity all this whining & name-calling. What good does that do? Put that energy towards something positive.
Positive Our president would be impeached if he didnt something wrong. You people need to just go with the flow until hes impeached or done
Negative Stupid
Positive Danny Jones I'll happily second that!!!!
Positive Thank you Mr President
Positive Trump made some very specific promises during his campaign and I voted for him because of those promises. I want three things before I vote for Trump in 2020. 1). I want Hillary/The Clinton Foundation prosecuted. 2). I want progress on the Wall. Funding and the wall being started. 3). I want Obama Care repealed. No, I didn't say fixed or a work around or even kind of repealed. I want it Repealed. And NO(!) repealing the "mandate" is NOT the same thing as a repeal. And no, he didn't promise to FIX Obamacare. Donald Trump was clear, he promised to repeal the most oppressive legislation ever imposed on the American people. These points are nonnegotiable; period.
Positive Sorry for your loss.
Positive That's What sanctuary cities are all about
Positive John N Karen Morris yes that is something a fascist cunt would do.  We know how to deal with fascism here.    To report a president that is a Russian asset, support Mueller.
Positive Outstanding leadership President Trump!
Negative Real talk
Positive Amen to you and your family we send our prayers
Negative on behalf of idiots everywhere, let me say how insulting!
Negative Should have never happened  opposers can say what they want ...but the facts remain- if this illegal wasnt here she would still be alive! How we spend billions on taxpayer funded abortions but cant find 5 to build a wall infuriates me!
Positive Yes, please don't let us ever forget those who have suffered because of our open borders. It is time to get our borders closed so we can be safe and check everyone coming into our homeland.
Negative I propose building a wall in memory of those lost over the past 3 decades due to lack of and ineffective border security. Think of all those lost since 1990 due to terrorist attacks along with all of those killed by illegal criminal aliens. The wall could be similar to that of the Vietnam Veterans Wall and it could travel throughout all 50 states making people aware of the lives lost giving us the opportunity to pay homage to them. Thank you for all you do Mr. President. We are praying for you in all your decisions and endeavors.
Positive Joseph Nowik all presidents have called national emergencies.  I cant wait until people know what they are talking about before spouting off.
Negative I'm shocked USA today wrote this. In the era where media is ignoring and dismissing angel families this is a shocker
Positive So sorry for your loss. Praying.
Negative Simone Piloni
Positive My question is, What real harm will a wall or fence do?
Positive Danny Jones you need to go educate yourself, and have all the facts checked! Please!
Positive This is a very sad story.  Too bad it has nothing to do with a stupid wall.
Positive Thank you Mr President You truly are a Godsend to America and the free world! God bless you
Negative Benedict Bchele we live in a free country, people can say what they want.
Positive I wish NANCY & CHUCK WOULD LISTEN TO THIS TRAGIC NEWS AND BUILD THE WALL!!
Positive So if a legal citizen kills a person, it's okay, right?
Positive Curtis Rice gee Curtis.  Maybe that's because there are more of us...
Negative What about melina trump she is also immigrant
Negative losing life is greatest thing we could not accept this !!
Negative EVEN IF IT MEANS THE DEMS WON'T GET THEIR PACK OF MONEY FROM THE SOUTH.
Negative Debbie Valdovinos you are ignorant or a liar, which?
Positive I'm sure when wealthy Americans built barriers around their homes, they weren't directing thoughts of illegal immigrants or cartels breaking in there homes.  I'm pretty sure they were thinking bout Americans meth heads instead
Positive MAY GOD COMFORT HIS FAMILY.
Positive Jamie Bennett I agree! What does he care about?
Negative Illegals don't belong here! We welcome immigrants coming legally! If they are coming illegally, they must be hiding something! BUILD THE WALL!
Positive Prayers for you and your families.

Positive Ride Mr President. You have true love for America. God bless President D. Trump.
Positive Yes the sooner the better.
Positive President Trump,  Please enforce border walls and security to enforce our southern border NOW!
Positive We need the wall but we need to staff our wall with our military men and woman. If they attempt to cross our boarder we have every right to eliminate that illegal immigrant to extent of power we need to use up to and including death
Positive It's not about a wall! It's all about the voting booth! We have a RIGHT to have voter I'D!  Now let's talk collusion & meddling in an election!  TRUMP MAGA 2020++++++++
Negative WHEN IS EVERYONE GONNA GET IT???    THE ONLY REASON MUELLER DID THE INVESTIGATION WAS TO KEEP THE HEAT OFF HIMSELF, HILLARY AND OBAMA FOR THE CLINTON EMAIL SCANDEL.  TIME TO GET THE CROOKS IN PRISON.
Positive So go over there and do what you say you want to do. Nobody's stopping you
Positive PLEASE POST YOUR PROOF!
Negative Uk British family not the people had no right signing the Belfour Declaration are they secretly Jewiish???
Positive Thank you sir!
Negative Dont use other peoples grief to push your personal agenda. Your own administration admitted the wall was not where the problem was. The border patrol themselves said the wall isnt the problem. Get your head out of your ass and address the actual problem. THE PORTS OF ENTRY. Every government body involved in the border knows it.
Negative Dave Callender this is awesome man! Godbless my brother!
Positive Thank you, Mr. President.
Positive All the mass shootings I believe have been committed by white Americans.
Negative Build the wall. Stop the spread of the dumbocrap communist party.
Positive Start interior enforcement & not just criminals....
Negative Renieri Ortiz there is a huge difference between a legal immigrant and an illegal immigrant.
Positive God bless Mr.President Trump.
Positive An American citizen just killed 5 people - we must build a wall around Illinois. An American citizen just killed 4 people in a hostage situation - we must build a wall around Mississippi. Parkland; Newtown; Las Vegas; Charleton, SC; Sutherland Springs, TX; Killeen, TX; Aurora, CO; Aurora, IL;  etc, etc, etc... American citizens mass-murdering American citizens.  WHERE ARE OUR WALLS, WHERE IS OUR NATIONAL EMERGENCY??
Positive Yea..cuz we know the 1s that have them illegally  will turn theirs in when the ban takes place..!!
Positive Then why are KGB are in the WH?..
Positive Yes sir!!! Build the wall now!!!
Negative Can we build a wall around every White American Male, you know just in case they decide to go nuts and shoot up a church, school, concert, etc??
Positive Skip Rowland guessing you don't have to live around meth toting Mexicans. instead all you retards are making it about race. try visiting one of the cities or counties that have been infested by methicans(aka drug mules) like my area. all you can see is addicts, murder, fighting and stealing. they are living in houses that aren't supposed to be lived in by anyone.
Positive You are the best President of U.S.A
Negative If you don't value human life, and oppose this wall, your opinion simply does not matter. You're nothing more than a sack of skin staring into space with nothing behind your eyes.
Negative How many lives will be saved!!!! My baby brother died from that junk they are bringing in.
Positive All celebrities who live in  walled mansions  should tear them down and erupt a sign out front that says  All immigrants ( illegal only ) are welcome to come in, hang out, eat my food, sleep in my bed, get an allowance.  And dont worry, we wont check your ID. We trust you.
Positive So sorry for your loss. May God let you feel his love and presence. And may he lead America and our leaders to make sure this never happens again!!!
Negative this is nazi propaganda that Josef Goebbels himself could have not better crafted - disgusting and dangerous, this is not a president, this is an old man full of hate and arrogance
Negative Lol fucking moron
Negative If you really want to protect American families start with gun control.
Negative Lyle Geyer What is safty?
Negative I fully agree that we need border security. However, a wall is not the most effective or cost efficient way to secure the border. We need a mix of physical barriers and technology, with emphasis on the latter.
Negative Do they also work for mass shootings????
Negative Im so sorry for your loss... I agree that President Trump is right about the wall.
Negative Maureen Hersey Brown its the democrats
Negative Trumper..go get a colonoscopy and flush out the orange kool aid...

Positive Kelly Preiss Wilhelm I never want to see anyone killed period. He does talk about it though.   Its criminals which will always have guns . We could ban all guns in America.   The criminals would still have them.  Gun control only disarms the good ppl.  Im so sorry you lost someone to this crime invested country.  And we all need to work together to push out the bad.  Not argue.  Theres a lot more good ppl than bad.  Ppl has to stand up to the thugs.  Theyre out numbered by far.

Positive Cathy Rohrer-Mackenrodt  first illegal aliens not immigrants and 2nd even though this sounds crazy it's not illegal to be illegal in our country. It has always been they can only be deported if they commit a felony.
Negative Dave really great sarcasm but I think it is lost on most of the people who would read this post, certain your not British?
Positive Democrats are especially good at twisting words... it's what they do.
Negative Maths?
Negative Well! She would have died eventually anyways  Said every dim witted liberal ever
Positive What if I told you walls don't work, and trump is scamming the American people to further his own agenda
Positive Any crime committed by an illegal immigrant is a crime that could have been avoided if our borders were secure and our immigration laws were enforced.
Positive Eva Graham Pelosi has lost all sense.
Positive Thank you POTUS for taking action where other so-called U.S. presidents failed. Q - 17! 23 v 32

Positive Carsten Adsersen.   How incredibly stupid a comment is that? Senior citizens partake in far less murders then people in their 20s.  Does  this mean we don't enforce the law against senior citizens? Liberals are so stupid
Positive "Could've been my son!"
Positive These families should start suing the Federal Government for substantial damages in these cases . . .
Negative So. If a citizen killed your daughter?  She'd be "less dead"? Grow the fuk, up.

Positive Hussein Obama=Whabbist/Zionist. Get 9/11 reinvestigated now.
Negative Not fooling me with one off stories.  Statistics!
Negative American people will receive a smaller refund this year after filing their income tax returns. The Republican/Trump tax cuts is a big scam that only benefits the rich. That's all Paul Ryan wanted; he got it and ran away.    Lower tax refunds might hurt the economy. If Americans are getting less money back, that might mean they're going to spend less of their refund. - Jordan Valinsky  Your (small) refunds will be delayed thanks to President Donald Trumps shutdown.  "I DIDNT NEED TO DO THIS." - Donald Trump as he declares a national emergency taking billions of dollars away from our Veterans, and leaving for Florida for the weekend to PLAY GOLF.  Trump biographer Craig Unger detailed Saturday morning the links between the presidents ties to the Russian mob and the silence of his former campaign manager Paul Manafort. Unger, author of House of Trump, House of Putin, explained on MSNBCs AM Joy that unlike the Italian mafia, Russia mobsters report to Vladimir Putin  essentially making them state actors for the Kremlin. I found 13 people who have had been in Trump Tower, associated with the Russian mafia, the author explained, adding that the organized criminals on and off for 35 years used the presidents flagship Manhattan building as a base of operations. When Donald Trump over expanded in Atlantic City and went bankrupt to the tune of $4 billion, Russian money played a huge, huge role in his financial bounce-back.

Negative Congrat!
Positive And your plans to keep American's safe from those shooting at anyone/everyone in a gun massacre is for more people to be armed?! Not taking into account how many hot heads might resort to using their gun when they lose their temper too easily?!
Positive Jennifer Yvonne Croff then maybe a American drunk driver would hit her. What then
Positive Americans must support Donald J Trump in all aspects in other to get America working again.  Donald J Trump for second term
Positive So true!!!!!!!!!!!
Negative Tell Pelosi/Schumer. Its not ok for illegals to kill Americans just so theyll vote for Democrats
Positive All this stuff is really sad. But a wall isnt the solution. This is a propaganda tactic. He's trying to elicit an emotional response from people, rather than appealing to people's intellect.
Positive Im praying for you, Mr. President! The wall will be a great blessing to this nation. Thank you for caring for the people of this nation and making the wall a priority!
Negative After u laid of 800k Americans, some of who lost their homes  and apts.
Positive An illegal immigrant hit my mother in oncoming traffic on Cinco de mayo... Glad she is still here.no justice for his actions.
Negative Deception and more lies
Negative As a gay woman I worry more about white men than brown men
Negative Wayne Brunner, I tuned in to CNN today and they had all the Democrats over there vying for more gun control. But the shooter had a lengthy criminal history and was not even supposed to own a firearm but he was able to purchase it. When he tried to get a concealed weapons permit that is when they did the big enough background check to find out that he was not allowed to own that firearm so the government ran by democrats there sent him a letter to have him turn it in. Apparently he didn't care what the letter said and they never did anything about it. The blood is on the hands of the the Region's government. So the government actually created this problem and now they want to step in and fix it simply by taking all rights away
Positive Its so sad Democrats are so corrupt
Negative What about 167 million for Flint, Michigan water problem. Why is this not more important then a stupid wall
Positive Build the wall, nice and tall
Positive Charlesetta Brown better check with Obamas Chief Border Guard.  Apparently he isnt listening to you or any other liberal.  He supports Trump on his decision to build a wall.  Doubt the veracity google it and find out for yourself.  Interesting that a former Obama official agrees with the Trump administration.  Especially since he is the individual one should listen to.
Positive So sorry for your loss may God heal your heart
Negative The left is going to fight you even if  you cure cancer.
Positive For sure
Positive The Democrats don't care about your daughter or anyone son or daughter.  And only people that live with armed security like Chucky and Nancy have Blood on their hands of Americans.  If Chucky or Nancy daughter or son or grand kids.  Would be killed.  This would all be a different story.
Positive And a young white male killed all the Kids in Parkland High School.....what is your point????? Do we do a BIBLICAL CLEANSING" and neutralize  all young white males of a certain age bracket???? See how silly this is??????????
Positive A human killed ur daughter it has absolutely nothing to do with wether he was illegal or not.
Negative I'll say it again you only want that wall to have your b******* name plaster all over it to have something that will stand in history
Positive Melissa Corrente face the facts
Negative I just do NOT understand they level of insanity in people that think this is not necessary
Positive Shirley Swallow amen!
Positive He is a good President, he knows that is the best by this country
Negative You ppl are idiots
Positive what about all the school shootings?!?!? cancel schools!!!!!
Negative We buried my dear friends daughter last year . Illegal and 3rd time drunk driving offender here in California . 3rd time it took Ashleighs young life . Thank you Mr President . Now we tax payers are paying for his housing , electric , heating , laundry , medical care , food ..... that need to stop and transfer those benefits to a veteran ! Push this man back over the wall or over Nancys wall !
Positive They also flew into the world trade towers but a wall wont help that.
Negative By that logic we should ONLY let in violent criminal illegal border jumpers to balance out the scales of justice?! Wow, you're really a special kind of stupid!
Negative Kate Steinle? Oh wait, Molly Tibits? No? Mandy ? Damn! Its hard to keep up! No national emergency though? Right?
Positive so sorry for your loss!
Positive Lark Jarvis you must think you have a lot more knowledge than the men who work for border patrol and deal with situations at the border every day. They do think a wall will help.  I think a lot of people like you just dont want it to help.
Positive Mike Jackson It is a big deal.
Positive Americans safety 1st!   Condolences to this family and all the families that have lost a loved one due to heinous actions of illegal immigrants....
Positive PLEASE BUILD THE WALL.
Positive Take a good look ,chuck ,nancy and maxie,hopefully one of you is next
Positive While this is tragic... What about the tens of thousands of children killed by gun violence? Gun violence is our national emergency
Positive Stop exploiting these families  to try to gain favor for your monument.  Your fake concern is appalling and despicable.
Positive The wall must stand firm, Trump the greatest leader in our life time.
Negative Beth Ritchason those people have a right to be here. We don't need to import more criminals! DRUGS poor over that boarder and Americans die.
Negative It is awfully naive to think a wall along our southern border will stop people and drugs from coming into our country.  The northern border is much longer.  Our coastlines ate much longer.  Tunnels go under walls. Ladders and drones, etc. go over walls.  The main entry point for drugs is driving right through existing and managed ports of entry.  There are smart enhancements to be made to our border security - and in some strategic stretches, that may include a barrier.  But your siren call about a wall actually hurts our countrys ability to work analytically and thoughtfully, based upon reality and data, to ID and implement smart, effective enhancements to our southern border.  Stoking fear is indeed a strategy- but not one great leaders choose.
Positive Tony Lamb .org  I HAD A DREAM!   I have had many end times dreams.   In my dreams I saw the destruction of America. America (Babylon) is Entering Judgement.  I saw nuclear weapons going off in most major American cities. I saw two Asteroids hit the earth. One of these Asteroids caused a Tsunami that was several hundred feet high to hit America's East coast. I saw A mega-earthquake on the west coast that caused two other faults to rip wide open causing another massive Tsunami on the West Coast. Then these earthquakes caused several major Volcanoes to erupt. I saw America ripped in half by the New Madrid fault ripping America in half from the Great Lakes down to New Orleans and this was up to hundreds of miles wide at some points.  America's heartland was turned into a great sea between two continents. And yes I saw Yellowstone erupt with a massive eruption. I was above the earth witnessing all this. But then I zoomed down and in close and I saw civil war in America. I saw Americans shooting and bombing other American's. I saw paper money blowing down the street and no one gave it a thought as it was worthless paper.  Everyone was starving and people were eating bugs, bark, leaves and grass as the hunger was so great. I saw people cooking and eating other people. I saw parents cooking and eating their children. I saw parents trading their children for a hand full of rice or beans. Cannibalism was so rampant that no one gave it a thought as it had become common and normal.   What I saw was in the Great Tribulation and I have had several dreams about this time to come. And my impression was this is NOT off in our distant future but was our near present time. I saw much, much more! The focus was America as America has sinned the most and drug or forced other nations into her abominations. But no part of the earth was spared, every nation, every island, every people, everywhere was touched by this Great Tribulation.  God has reached his limit for tolerating sin. So NOW God acts. The Holy Spirit came to me in a dream and hovered above my bed and spoke 4 words to me. "AMERICA IS ENTERING JUDGEMENT'. I prayed, I cried and I sobbed, I cried so hard because I knew what was to come.   A great deception will soon manifest and the whole world will be mesmerized by it. The faithful needs to be aware of this and not fall into this trap because many Christians will be deceived by this.   I believe this will be alien disclouser and the fact proposed by the media that aliens seeded life on this planet and they are here to help mankind. These aliens are demons straight from hell and they are NOT here to help mankind but to deceive us.  I saw Fallen Angels walking the earth destroying everything and everyone before them and no weapon could harm them.   REVELATION 9: 14 & 15 14 SAYING TO THE SIXTH ANGEL WHICH HAD THE TRUMPET, LOOSE THE FOUR ANGELS WHICH WERE BOUND IN THE GREAT RIVER EUPHRATES.  15 AND THE FOUR ANGELS WERE LOOSED, WHICH WERE PREPARED FOR AN HOUR, AND A DAY, AND A MONTH, AND A YEAR, FOR TO SLAY THE THIRD PART OF MEN.  This scripture says 4 Fallen Angels will be released upon the earth and will kill a third (1/3) of mankind. (I was shown this verse after my Fallen Angel dream.)  Also a Great Shaking is coming to America soon. I do not know what form this will take, economic collapse, war, Asteroid strike, Earthquake, Super Volcano, Tsunami something big IS COMING. And when it gets here every person in America will be shaken to their very core.  ALSO I know the Rapture is very soon also. I don't know when this will come in relationship to these other events, before, during or after these other events BUT IT IS COMING AND SOON.  So pray, look up for your redemption draweth nigh. BUT we who are faithful in Jesus Christ will be raptured out of here and WE WILL NOT BE HERE for the Tribulation.  God Bless you, and God keep you and yours.   www.tonylamb .org  Your Watchman on the Wall For Jesus Christ. Tony Lamb

Positive Attached is a link to official Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) statistics on border apprehensions for our Northern, coastal, and Southern borders for FY 2000 - 2017. Total apprehensions in FY 2017 were approx 20% of what they were in FY 2000. However, our current president says the stats HE HAS from CBP indicates an increase: https://www.cbp.gov/
Positive The wall will have to start deep underground. Apparently, they are not good at climbing walls, but they are very good at tunnels. Maybe they fly. I don't think the wall is a good idea. Will be better to end poverty and injustice in the world.
Negative Linda, here in the US oldsters who spend 60% plus of their time watching TV, talking on the phone, tweeting nonsense, golfing, and traveling to golfing vacations and rah rahs are called "retirees."
Positive Do u know what pee me off is good american people like wendi that has lost a someome and  people like Nancy Pelosi and some of these other dems won't even give them the time of day to talk to him they just brush him off and say the heck with them

Negative Draft dodging warrior huh?
Positive Well maybe you got some TBI now.
Negative Temicka Brown at least it'd be a free ride home
Negative Some of you are just missing the whole point of the fact illegal means illegal no matter if they are killers or sweet little old ladies...ILLEGAL means they are not supposed to be here without going through the immigration laws and procedures...smh
Positive Why aren't the moms of American civilians murdered in shooting sprees by American citizens called "angel moms" too?

Positive Donald Trump is 100% right
Positive Linda Gurtz Hildreth probably fake ones like the Obama birth certificate.
Positive So sad.. May she RIP.. GET THAT WALL UP QUICK..
Positive Trump has done nothing but spread hate and divide this country.the big tax break was for the rich and 72% of Americans will have to pay back money. Did you know the rich don't have to pay federal taxes? The rich take care of each other.  Trump is not taking any pay for being a President because its being made up by all the extra money from his tax break. I didn't say he wasn't stupid.
Positive Fantastic President trump you are doing a great job for all American families. Keep up with good job.
Negative Soooo there are no home grown "white" bad people?
Positive Veronica Torres, What Do you mean by they??? By the way are you Hispanic? If you are, I just hope that you are kind, to the undocumented immigrants, because sometimes they can experience the worst cruelty from their own kind.!!!
Negative Corey Groff sure  how about we do SOMETHING about the real national emergency?
Negative We support you and fully agree with you!!! Build that wall because Congress and the Democrats don't know how the rest of us live and go through. The rest of us don't have a security detail or the money to invest in high quality security systems.
Negative Mr President dont forget america is build and made from emigrants from all over the world

Positive But all who live in america are illegal immigrants except ppl who have indian roots
Positive Raphael Pulman  This is very insightful about the European Union (EU) government.  """ Dear Mr. Temple, Thank you for your supportive email. The EU president was not elected into his post and is meant to be the face of 450 million people in Europe.  There is no mechanism to remove him and no way, through the ballot box, that the people of Europe can hold him to account.  The European Union is a undemocratic and corrupt organisation that tries to force us to accept one EU currency, one EU flag and one EU state without the consent of the people. It is my job to fight against this and be the voice of free speech - again thank you for your kind message. Yours sincerely, Nigel Farage" """
Negative Amen. To that
Positive This only helps to spread fear and hate amoung ignorants.

Positive Go Mr. President, go. You are the best. Dimitris from Greece/Hellas.
Positive With all due respect...this could have been done by any us citizen.  Not just a  immigrant.      This happens all the time in the US by us citizens.   Alchoholism is a  horrid disease.    Guns kill at much higher rates  as Americans purposely murder at much higher rates.
Negative how many americans kill eachother every day
Positive Michael Curtin  hi
Positive Simon Kitson ... didn't donnie mention chain migration? Does he mean melanoma's parents?
Positive You know what would protect our families more than backward logic straight out of the 1st century? Healthcare for all, increased funding for schools, environmental protections, better wages. But you keep sticking to your regressive guns, champ
Negative Do WE have LAWS.???  .......
Positive You missed the entire point of my post, Janie. Congratulations.   By your logic, everyone who dies by firearm wouldn't be dead if those were banned. Does that mean that we should ban firearms? No, it does not. Does that mean we should politicize gun deaths for the sake of taking gun rights away? No.   Please understand the complete hypocrisy before commenting again.

Positive Build it and make it so the Democratic nation cant take it down.
Negative George E Simpkins Jr  and just like Trumps point, it has nothing to do if the person who killed this guy daughter was illegal or not. Or his point is that if youre legal you have the right to kill?
Positive trump should just send im thoughts and prayers-like he did the other day to the families of the victims of the Parkland shootings.
Positive Build the wall !!!
Negative Declares a national emergency. Flies to his resort and goes golfing. Suckers !!!
Positive Good pick
Positive Dennis McCullar if lives is the criteria,  then gun violence and the opioid epidemic are greater emergencies.
Positive If you really cared about the lives of American families, you would declare a national emergency for gun reform since more lives are taken by guns, than illegal immigrants. Gun reform would be much more effective and cost less than your 8 billion dollar wall.
Negative We have more HOMEGROWN terrorists...tRump's a bigly fool.
Negative That fucking forehead, Christ
Positive All the Dems care about is illegals, invaders and criminals
Positive Linda Durbin   You mean working so hard on the golf course? You have to stop drinking the Kool-Aid. It has seriously affected your health.  Republicans think we hate Trump more than we love America.  The truth is, we hate Trump because we love America.

Positive So sorry for your loss.
Positive STEVEN MILLER on Fox News. Rhino Neo Con Chris Wallace trying to get him  to made a mistake. Wallace arrogantly trying to trip  him up. MILLER was magnificent. KNEW the Law.  If Miller had been sent to negotiate  a spending bill instead of Democrat Jared Kushner., Rhino Lindsey Graham and Mike Pence...TRUMP WOULD HAVE THE MONEY... Before 2020, someone needs to do an intervention and get Kushner Out of the White House. Ambassador to Israel? Tune out Graham. Not his friend.
Positive Simon Kitson Im just messing with you, at this point...Im admiring your persistence, lol!
Negative Larry Fields and the sad part is the left sees nothing wrong with this. And you are exactly right!!
Positive A wall will not make us safer #Dotard! Ever hear of ladders? Tunnels? How about simply cutting through the prototype steel that you're thinking of using?

Negative Adam Somerville Amen
Negative Eva Graham you are sad
Negative So sorry for your loss. My heart is very sad for all the Angel Parents caused by Devils here Dems gladly let in!
Negative I wonder about the mental faculties of people who buy into Donalds propaganda messaging of hate and intolerance. The same people who feel the need to place blame in the case of unfortunate accidents. Small minded individuals who cant reason past the end of their noses. The same breed of people as the petty, vindictive moron child in the White House.
Negative Adopt the Texas law! Execute murderers regardless of citizenship.
Negative Shits beyond stupid. Let's just pull out of other countries and go to war with south America. This post is wack.
Negative The wall needs to be built for American Security. President Trump is aware of all the violence in the border towns.
Positive So sad....the left thinks voters are more important than the security of our own people.....4,001 killed in two years by illegal immigrants.....in Phoenix we have 7.5% illegal immigrants.....50% of all class one felonies are caused by the 7.5% of the population.....33% of all drug arrests are for the 7.5% of the population.... 74% of the 7.5% are on benefits for life...at least since the 1986 Immigration Reform Act.....

Positive ORourke, a Democratic former Texas congressman and candidate for Senate, responded in an interview with MSNBCs Chris Hayes Thursday to a question tweeted by Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas), who asked whether ORourke would make the citys border wall disappear if he could.  Absolutely, ORourke said without hesitation.  Id take the wall down, ORourke said, adding that the barrier has not in any demonstrable way made us safer.  ORourke said the existing wall has pushed migrants and asylum seekers and refugees to the most inhospitable, the most hostile stretches of the U.S.-Mexico border ensuring their suffering and death.
Negative Get it done.  We need it.  Thank you, Mr. President.
Negative You can't sign that bill...way too many horrible things in there.

Same day he declares a FALSE National Emergency on the border our REAL NATIONAL EMERGENCY REARS ITS DEADLY HEAD AGAIN WITH 5 DEAD, 5 POLICE INJURED AS WELL AS OTHER INNOCENT VICTIMS.

There is NO difference between Angel Moms or any other family who has suffered this unimaginable loss by gun violence in our country by our own American citizens...

Positive Nicole Richardson
Negative An American killled these people in a walled community in Newport Beach, "The Most Republican County in America."   ----   "Two women and a man are found dead at a gated Newport Beach community in Valentine's Day-eve triple homicide"  ----- Lotta good a wall did them.
Negative PAUL HOW ABOUT OUR POLITICIANS WORK TOGETHER AND DO THE BEST FOR THIS COUNTRY AND ITS CITIZENS.....
Negative Thank you and bless you, President Trump for doing what is right for the American people!!! Praying for all these families 
Positive We also should not give any illegal immigrant any kind of benefits or welfare I think this would turn away a lot of them from coming into the United States.
Negative Trump. Dude. You have been eating up the fake news for years now. Stop it already. Please. Resign. You are not qualified to handle this job. You are screwing up America.
Negative BUILD THE MOTHER FUCKING WALL
Negative Debbie Bauman close to my daughter's age. Do you track him still? What he'd be doing ? That sort of thing. He'd be 32 now? I'm sorry. He was old enough to know him as a man and the person he was becoming. Every year is a gift.
Positive He's so big on immigration reform yet he employs  so many illegal immigrants and married one then had her parents come over here think about
Positive Keep doing what you are doing
Positive Yeah liberal morons have been saying if gun control saves one life its worth it, but guess where most of the "gun violence" occures. Gun free zones and cities with higher gun laws. Yup how's that working for you libtards.
Positive Mr trump im so proud of the work u are doing.ive never seen any eather.prisdent like u mr trump.u have my support
Positive We can and will build the wall! We need it for protection from invaders! God bless this country once again!
Positive There should be no question on this wall.  We need to protect Americans.  Sorry for your tragic loss .. if the wall can help prevent one tragedy like this.   Well worth it.    Lets all fight with our President to get it done.  Build the wall.
Positive Build that wall Mr. President I completely agree with you and support the idea of protecting our country. Im firmly in support.
Negative Only fools think Walls dont work!  WALLS WORKED!  Look  around your house  and see what Walls do for you and your family!  If walls dont do anything for you, Tear those walls down!  Its simple as that!!! A message from a lowly lowly Master Sergeant (Ret),  USAF from San Joaquin Valley, California, a Ground Zero for Armed Criminal Illegal Aliens because of Sanctuary State Policy benefiting Illegals enacted by Corrupt, Greedy, Heartless, Lobbyists (Bribes) Loving Cynical Democrat Politicians led by Wicked Nightmares Creator and Anti-Border Security Speaker Nancy Pelosi!  #45MAGABUILDTHESOUTHERNBORDERWALLS
Positive Barbara leonetti please can I by your friend
Positive Sharon Fantana
Negative Easy answer..trumpers..
Positive You yourself said, in Fridays Rose Garden announcement, that you did not need to do this now.  Of course, you wont play that part for your blind followers - gotta manage their perception of dear leader!!!  How can it be an emergency if you did not need to do it now and as you said, it could be done over several years?  You are one terrible leader.
Negative When do we declare gun violence a national emergency ?
Negative It's unfortunate that she's dead nit antidotal evidence, stories, have no place in policy decisions.
Positive Do their lives matter more than the multiple children killed each year in mass school shootings?
Negative Craig Shurick , you really think 90% of illegals came through a checkpoint? If so, you are very misinformed.
Positive President Donald J. Trump thank you for trying to save America from the drugs and the invasion. as a life time Democrat i salute you for fighting for us
Positive Kelly Anders wow, really?  50% of violent crime in America is committed by 13% of the population and they ain't white.
Negative Curtis Rice inbreeding
Positive U BETCHA
Negative He lost his home but he paid his worker and his venders because he was old school .  He told to file for bankruptcy too but his love for country and family did not let him do that . Now he is a broken man just because he believed in you . Are country is head in the same direction AMERICA awake up , this guy is no business man he is a CONMAN
Positive Saves lives of border patrol too. They have family.
Negative Carl Mrner Trumpcucks get hard off of dead kids.
Positive Amen!!!!
Positive Build the wall!! This is the ONE President who will GET IT DONE!!
Positive What about gun laws asshole
Positive I agree with you.  I am so sorry about your loss of Mandy.   Please know there are many who are trying hard to get the facts out but it is difficult.  I do believe we will have a wall eventually.  Don't give up and all the best to you and your family!
Positive Was that an illegal immigrant that gunned down five coworkers and wounded five police the other day? The REAL emergency in the United States - gun violence.
Positive FAKE CRISIS, FAKE PRESIDENT!
Positive People will come into open doors of your house. Leave your house and open the doors and you will see with open doors people just walk in.
Negative Because walls work
Negative Hal Eric Mitlitsky you lefties keep regurgitating that mantra about gun control. So stupid, its in the constitution. Also did any of you lunatic leftwings know that Obama already did it 12 times in his Presidency? Btw, we dont give a rats @$$ what  names you whiney sore losers call us. We have names for you too.The dems have to bring in outsiders because the American citizens see they are not for the betterment of this country. Patti Cullen, try telling that to Ms. Pukelosi or the 12 times Obama did it.
Positive Shame your daughter died. Just glad the wall is getting built
Positive Singling out people? What about all the mass shootings in our own country?Americans shooting Americans?Highest in he free world. Gun control? The emergency appears to be your mind?
Positive Painful as it is , this type of situation repeats itself but in different scenarios. But a wall wont solve the presidents ego. Next itll be a some other promise he made to impress the masses holding someone else accountable. Mexico was going to pay for the wall he said . He knew that was a farce . When Irak was invaded , it was because of weapons of mass destruction which were never found to this date . Do not become part of the play because of your loss . Trump is disrespectful of your pain in doing this . Do not let them use you.
Positive I pray that the democrats will see the need and help.
Negative The Congress wastes more in an hour than a wall the entire length of the border with Mexico would cost.   With a multi trillion dollar budget the 6 billion that Trump wants for a wall is a rounding error.
Positive But it will be much,much harder.Every country who has a wall say their illegal's have dropped from 50-95% success rate.Israel is at 99%.He is on the front lines we just have news to go by,and some choose to listen and salivate to fake news..And those who believe in God and his word the bible,it's in many a scripture.
Negative Nancy Pelosi and Democrats have not negotiated in good faith to fund a wall at our Southern Border, proving that obstruction is far more important to them than YOUR SAFETY.  Last week, more than 95% of the Patriots I polled demanded a wall. Thats because WALLS WORK! I was just in the great city of El Paso, Texas, where illegal traffic has dropped over 90% because of their beautiful wall.  I cannot allow Americas safety and security to be put at risk any longer. We need the wall, and I must put AMERICA FIRST!  Nancy and Democrats have said they will consider filing a legal challenge to ensure the wall is never built, as they continue putting illegal immigrants before Americans. So, we need you to make a HUGE statement to them right now.  Im setting a goal of raising $2,OOO,OOO. I know a goal this big is unprecedented, but we need the American people to make a powerful statement to these Democrats to FINISH THE WALL.  https://donate.donaldjtrump.com/finish-the-wall?amount=42&DCPe=ZGpzYWdlQG1zbi5jb20&utm_medium=email&utm_source=ET_16&utm_campaign=20190217_9282_finish-the-wall_donaldjtrump_tmagac&utm_content=gop_direct-ask_text_contribute_top_42_dn
Negative I'm disabled from a stroke from a head on collision with a drunk illegal, there was no shoulder either yet a big ditch I thought he was passing till it was too late he wasn't supposed to pass on a solid line anyways but it happens so that's what I was figuring
Negative Joseph Roy start with Americans first tho. That's where Trump should start
Negative Mr. President, thank you for fighting FOR AMERICA!
Negative #maga many are getting arrested
Positive I dont care what the Left says you, President Trump, you do love our Country and you need to protect us! The Wall is definitely needed! ITS TIME TO BUILD THAT WALL!
Negative Keith Webber Jr.  You are wrong ..you must be in Trump's 35% base
Positive Deport and build wall we must defend,Americans first other countries need take care there own
Positive The best president ever!
Negative BLACK WHITE WHITE WON WHITE HEAT SUN
Negative We need that wall Mr. President'
Positive YES!!!!!!!!!!!!
Negative So sorry for your loss it should never happen the loser Democrats will pay one day
Positive Keep up good work President Trump
Positive There are too many American killers as well into or out of the country killing people by Townsend and Townsend in wars for example. Dsole. Here also we have assassins of all the countries and own killers as well. What's the example, please, I can't understand the a reason named "why". Please tell me trust. 
Positive Victoria Kay Riddick Cochran Facebook is not allowing me to see any responses for some reason
Negative Ok ppl are getting paranoid here
Positive File a law suit against Pelosi and Schumer and take their millions that they have gotten from the cartels.   Unbelievable the demonic-rats!!!
Positive And now you just signed an amnesty bill.. great!  How come there never in two years were no figures presented regarding Islamic migration into the US? I t did vastly increase didnt it? While it decreased allot from culturally Christian countries.
Positive 10 us code section 284... build the walls
Negative Say whatever you want, but what Trump meant was there was no real need for a emergency action. Meaning the Democrats and Republicans could have and should have sorted this out 20,000,000 illegal immigrants ago!
Positive  How many more will there be , so sad...the left cant agree... It takes a heartless bunch of Democrats to do what they do well absolutely nothing but care about themselves... guarded ,in their gated fairytale land they live in... what if sumthin like this happen to Pelosi.. AND I dont wish it anyone but its just so sad!!! Get these illegals out .. poor innocent children ,people !!! lost for words ... wake up morons 
Positive Yes President keep up the good work youre an amazing man and president!
Negative Kelly Anders I'll say it for everyone. Your a fucking idiot.
Positive If thats your priority try to do something about mass shootings
Positive Walls work...get over Hillary!
Negative So no gun control ?
Positive Done now your turn!!
Positive Large walls with armed guards anyway
Positive Let's be clear, this was a car accident. It was vehicular homicide, NOT murder. We still don't know if Joel Velasquez is illegally in the country or not. We don't know if a wall woulda helped or not.
Negative Brian Sterling many ifs there jefe
Positive If the illegal population voted Republican guess how fast an armed electric fence with a mine field would be built........
Negative Dont you realize, a border is not going to keep the bad outitll only the establish the evil within
Negative Why didn't Trump build a wall two years ago when he had a majority in Congress...Because it was not an emergency. Illegal border crossings and apprehensions have been declining for nearly two decades, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and in 2017 were at their lowest point since 1971. A 2018 study published by the Cato Institute found that undocumented immigrants commit less crime than native-born citizens, and according to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) the majority of illegal drugs coming into the country across the southern border are being smuggled through legal points of entry. In other words, this president has manufactured an immigration crisis for his own political gain.
Positive After all the national emergencies for other countries from the past president.  About time we use one for our own country!
Positive Ahmad Mahmoud and you hide your head in a rag and cover your ugly women with body rags. Get on your camel goat fucker and leave
Positive I am not picking on Donald J. Trump screw that am sure he wouldn't actually wrestle me because I am a girl but if it were a wrestling match or just romping around like a bunch of kids yea I would bet he would be tough as nails to wrestle. Heck my brothers and sisters and I are all in our 10s, 402, and 30s and we still wrestle just for the fun of it all.  Whippin' up on each other just for fun so yea if he wants to wrestle heck yea I would wrestle with im because heck I love to romp and carry on like a child even though I am 37 years old. its all fun and games.  Heck yea its on.  but only in fun no meanness
Negative Luke Tierney WALL!!
Positive Without a doubt.....
Positive Have to stop electing democrates
Positive COMPLETE A COMPLETE boarder wall !!
Positive Its an incredibly sad day when liberals care more about foreigners than they do about our wives in children. I have no use for them and wish them straight to hell unless they change  their ways
Negative 1. Day 758 of 1462 (Illegitimate Presidency) - Embarrassing! The WORLD is laughing at the USA...VP Mike Pence speaking before a Security Conference in Munich was greeted with silence where the crowd was supposed to applaud. He looked visibly shaken after the 2nd time...Again, the WORLD is laughing at the USA b/c of Donald KKK Trump!  https://www.rawstory.com/2019/02/mike-pence-visibly-shook-nobody-claps-applause-lines-disastrous-european-trip/
Positive Ed Wrany not even the best president this afternoon  ...
Positive Dave Callender coming from a man who lives in New Hampshire where people don't lock their doors come down to South Texas you'll change your mind
Positive Democrats caused the govt shutdown....Democrats are InHumane. They hate Americans and WAWAWA CRYBABIES Personal Vendettas agAinst us True Americans Republicans should be our Congress Office since we have a Republican President...
Negative Agree!!! I have a list of people to deport and revoke their fake citizenship  have proof they lied on their application
Negative Such stupidity
Positive Bulls the wall
Positive Can I asked how they were an illegal resident?? Did they over stayed their vacation visa like majority of the illegal immigrants? Did they travel over by planes or cross over at the port of entry with a granted visa to only visit and return after their purpose? If so, if they were part of the 62% of illegal immigrants that are here by overstaying past their due dates... how is the wall going to stop others? Now if they were here illegally by hiking through the fields and crossing over outside port of entry, then I support the wall. I just want to know the facts.
Positive Steve Finigian you should research before dropping BS.
Positive So sad for you
Negative Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin WHAT PART OF ILLEGAL MAKES YOU THINK LAW ABIDING  THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE GUY IN THE MILITARY WAS PUNISHED AND YOU COULD GET SOME COMPENSATION FOR YOUR LOSS  BUT YOU ARE TOO BLIND TO SEE THAT  ILLEGAL MEANS ILLEGAL ILLEGAL MEANS AGAINST THE LAW   ONLY LIBERALS THINK ILLEGAL MEANS OBEYING THE LAW
Negative I just don't understand the Democrats and their coldness to these families who have lost loved ones to illegals.   I'm so sorry for all the losses and pray President Trump will get the wall built and our borders protected the way they should be protected.
Negative Most of them are CRIMINALS,  so sorry for your loss!
Negative Propaganda ..
Positive Bill Reese unfortunate accidents happen all the time. This story is purely about blaming illegal immigrants. And I will still stand with that is petty. Might as well blame the place that made the beer, maker of the truck, whom sold them gas.
Positive Thank you for caring about Mandy Ferguson! Thank you for protecting American citizens!
Positive Did this illegal immigrant even cross the border by ground or did they over stay their Visa or arrive by air or boat? A wall can only possibly stop one way of arrival, the most least used by illegal immigrants... a wall is stupid.
Positive GOD BLESS OUR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP
Negative she should not have died and wouldnt have if that Illegal hadnt of been in our Country.
Positive We really need the wall .
Positive Thank you Mr. President for caring about America while the democrats don't.
Negative He flew in from Portugal. He's Portuguese. Build a wall at the airport he flew into.
Positive I am so sorry for your loss!
Positive We need the wall!!!
Negative So sorry too all of you for your unimaginable losses.   BUILD THE WALL MR. PRESIDENT!!!   #buildthewall
Positive Build the wall !
Negative A illegal immigrant killed my friend georgia, he kidnapped her, beat her, raped her and then murdered her and sadly a few other women too before they could find him and take him down.
Positive Sean Walsh your comment doesn't deserve it
Negative how does it feel, Charles, to live your life being a disrespectful little punk?
Positive Yes it is important if its the only way to stop the influx of illegals
Negative This is a shame that we have lost any brother or family member! Politicians it will come to you some day more especially you corrupt shits that call yourself our representatives of the people!I call bullshit! When and if it does I do not want to hear one word of grief nor television media about it! Just live with it and move on because the Immigrants are not the problem! YOU POLITICIANS ARE THE WHOLE PROBLEM!  Build the damn wall Trump!
Positive https://youtu.be/tlfOPvUABnw
Negative Betty Jo Lollis thank you! I only shared so this way people know that MOST if not ALL illegals won't accept the word "NO" I have learned from this experience and I only hope that my story will entice others to break their silence too. It's ok to talk about it. It's a BIG problem amongst other things as well.
Positive Help Tymoshenko to become the President of Ukraine and we will come and build your wall without a congress.
Positive Trump #2020
Negative OK Stop sending 39 billion dollars to EU!!! I second that for any reason!!! You By Wall!! We Stop Payment to EU,Mexico,Guetamala,ElSalvador,Venezuela,Haiti,Africa,And Everybody!!! Great!!!
Positive Glad i live in canada you guys are nuts
Positive My heart goes out to you
Negative Matt Martine but criminal's dont care about gun laws they go around them but all these gun laws hurt law abiding people guns dont kill people, people kill people.
Positive Support him in 2020!  Please people dont forget!  Every vote is needed!
Positive A Minefield and some Constantine wire might work to
Positive R. Ryan Roach Duh. They're politicizing this poor woman's death to sell the building of the wall. If he got here by plane or boat, that's horrible, don't you think?
Negative You're a lying wonder 45! When you die soon there will be celebrating and feasting. In your adderall loaded mind the homegrown terrorists are very fine people.
Negative More Americans die at the hands of other Americans via gun violence but the wall is an emergency?
Negative "An illegal immigrant..."

Positive Mary Langan what??
Positive Love you Mr. President. #MAGA. Time to #ENDBORDERMADNESS
Negative If we keep giving illegal folks welfare they will keep coming.  Take away the incentives to come the wrong way. Give incentives to those who do it right.
Positive Remember that this pretty girl is AMERICAN just like you. Why isn't it the other way around, an illegal was killed by a pretty young American girl. You will never hear that.
Positive Because that has worked so far?  They do nothing! Let's declare some more sanctuary cities!  Oh, and forget about the children trafficked through that border each year
Positive Get it done, no matter the resistance, just get it done. We have your back.
Positive For every American killed by an illegal alien a Democrats family should pay the price. It's all about bringing it home to these untouchables and balance.
Negative Every day illegals are arrested in Atlanta for stealing, selling drugs or I think you knew I meant meth, I guess I am not perfect. Suffered stroke and brain and fingers aret together working.
Negative Do you Demtards even know what the word precedent even means???
Positive Just as i thought. You lil fkers dont care about americans.

Positive Even one Angel mom is too many
Positive Tomek Jasinski built that wall!!!
Positive Thank you President Trump for all your hard work to keep us safe...
Negative Some activist judge is supposed to tell The president of the United States what an emergency is. Where is the worthless supreme court to take this matter up directly.  Considering the fact that you have four activist liberal hand puppets on the Supreme Court for the leftist, and Roberts, I see a real constitutional crisis. Supreme court should just state that the Court does not have jurisdiction in this separation of powers issue.
Positive Adam Jasso we should be celebrating
Positive Yeah and a dingo took your baby.
Negative Gus Keller I'm sure you have. You've probably seen "mfers," step over invisible lines too. I'd guess would be easier, quicker, and a place of choice (unless you're are a Parkour practitioner)  vs. a place with wall. Similar with the "dig a hole" argument.
Positive MJ  Stark what color is the dress?
Positive Lord have mercy Irene Roberts! Yoi better open your mind. My question was not what is it. He has lied to you and told you that he has started. Nope. Where did the money come from ? Where is it? When did he start? He Is Lying To You. Point blank period. Of it is the truth you should be able to answer the what when and where. Believe in the truth. Sorry that is all I'm telling you. I don't care if you believe me.
Negative Having illegal immigrants in our country has gone long enough. Weve lost a lot of good Americans because these dirty/filthy illegal immigrants that wants to damned this great nation of freedom, but well not go down without a FIGHT!
Negative The press and media serve as a check and balance on power which is an underlying principle to our freedom. Power tends to corrupt and absolute power tends to corrupt absolutely. We need a check and balance on executive power.
Positive Um, he wasnt even supposed to be in America in the first place?
Positive Thank you for fighting for Americans!  We appreciate you so much
Positive Build that wall. MAGA
Negative Prison walls will keep us safe from you.
Positive Strong, effective border is absolutely necessary if we want to prosper. End exist as a nation.
Positive Illegal aliens people they are not  immigrants.
Positive If a president can go golfing hours after declaring a National Emergency, it's not a National Emergency.
Negative Estefania Torres Restrepo political gain how about safety....using the deaths to show a secure border is necessary!!!
Negative Trump I appreciate your efforts and you are not pts"DISORDERED" for being reputationally assaulted! It's pts INJURY CAUSED BY TERRORISTS AND JUSTICE CURES IT
Negative I think people are so caught up with being against building the wall that the whole idea here is being lost. Replace those words with enhancing security and see how you feel then. If someone broke in to the school your child attends youll be the first people saying How could that ever happen? Where was security? We pay all these tax dollars for what, so our child could be at risk where they should be safe? Or youre at a mall and someone bursts in and starts open fire. Youd be the first people demanding better enhanced security.  This wall is being built for SECURITY to keep the majority of the illegals out. If you are from a foreign nation and want to come here do it the right way. Get proper documentation, medical clearance, working papers, etc. Nothing good is coming out of illegals sneaking across the borders. Lets spend the money to enhance security (wall)  now so that money can then be spent to help the homeless, sick veterans, people who cant afford health coverage, etc, etc, etc who are American citizens instead of continuously paying for illegals who quite frankly, do not deserve to be here.  Has anyone heard of the quote You can pay now or pay later?  Well, Im sick of paying later. It hasnt done us any good. Solve the problem now so we can take care of our own problems on our own soil for American citizens sooner. #MAGA
Negative Build the wall and protect it with lethal force just like the Berlin Wall was
Negative Tudy Anderson Latulip true. And on 9/11 Congress agreed with President Bush because that was a real national emergency.

Negative Why do they have fiveheads?
Negative Marcus Rech MS13 is an AMERICAN gang, fyi.
Positive Pearl Brown Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR
Positive 140 Democrats last week voted against a resolution in Congress condemning the act of allowing illegals to vote in our elections.. While they've been screaming foreign interference, they've been the ones to admit it. They found nearly 2 million non citizens on the California voting registry. That's right, they are indeed, after saying they weren't, allowing illegals and non citizens to vote. That should be Trump's next EO. The only thing Cali agreed to do, was to remove the 153,000 dead voters on their roll, but they insist on leaving illegals, and non citizens registered. I don't know how this hasn't already been stopped, but the entire party, other than maybe Munchin, should be arrested, and brought up on  high treason charges
Negative A US police officer killed my ex, we should build the wall so Americans like him cant get out and ruin other countries lives.
Positive YES !
Negative I'm just wondering.....do people live under rocks? How do you not see the damage illegal immigrants do?
Positive I support our president, Donald Trump!
Positive Bull O'Neill HHS officials acknowledged that federal officials lost track of almost 1,500 migrant children in 2017 after they were placed with adult sponsors.
Negative Carol Flores and over 2/3rds of those are related to mental health. The statistics account for self harm and suicides as well. The vast majority of the rest are gang or street violence by people who are illegally in possession of the arms.   Depression kills more than violence and alcohol or tabacco kills more than both.  Opioids too...
Positive 100 million dollars worth of water bottles instead of actually fixing the damn pipes. FLINT NEEDS CLEAN WATER.  but you dont care
Positive Shayna Franzetti
Positive Our Country needs to stop listening to Democrats that lie to keep the border open. Their deceit has created the problems we face today.
Negative This was a jarring week as Trump declared a national emergency after Congress refused to fund his wall  perhaps his most brazen authoritarian act yet. Trumps predilection not to govern, but rather rule by an unprecedented executive fiat, set off alarm bells for Constitutional separation of powers, as Trump departed early Friday for a weekend of golf at Mar-a-Lago.  This week the Mueller probe made news as reporting indicated Trumps former campaign chair Paul Manafort discussed a peace plan for Ukraine and handed off internal polling data in a secretive meeting to a business associate with ties to Russian intelligence, and a search warrant revealed Roger Stone was in direct contact with WikiLeaks while interacting with the Trump campaign  both in the months before the 2016 election.  At a Trump campaign-style event in El Paso, a BBC cameraman was physically assaulted by a supporter  symbolic of Trumps continued attacks on the media and his stoking of hatred against marginalized communities. Trumps speech in El Paso and his declaring a manufactured emergency in Rose Garden were both a repetition of disproven lies and exaggerations, as Trump continues to propagate a dystopian alternate reality and act unilaterally.

Negative TRUMP 2020.
Negative You want reroute wall money to help US citizens? How about we reroute the billions we give illegals instead. How about the billions sent abroad to our so called allies?  Im pretty sure there are tons of dollars wasted on non citizens every day. Why take away our shot at securing the border?
Negative Nice generalization
Positive Go golf
Positive Can I donate my tax return to the wall?
Negative ... and walls cut off the vote recruitment stream.
Negative Took all of 30 seconds to find that. A lil research beyound Fox would do yall some real good.
Negative immigration overhaul
Positive You cant spell TRIUMPH without the letters T.R.U.M.P.
Negative Trumps a disgrace. He needs to be impeached, then imprisoned!
Positive They are all about if getting rid of all guns saves one life, it's worth it..... But lets keep the illegals and push abortion up to birth and after.... Hypocrites....
Negative Babi Nikki How can you be so cruel to say that the loss of her son has less concern or value or evil than another loss.  I feel sorry for you and will pray for people like you.  And I hope you never loose a child or loved one under these circumstances  And I also think that you must be a socialist communist democrat to make such a statement.  Shame Shame on you.

Nothing as far as we can see ? You have our support ! We need a wall ! We also need something done with the corruption ? Corruption kills people we never see , just by the action of it ?
Positive Charlesetta Brown dumbest comment today
Negative Whats so terrible about a wall? A wall is great, almost any other country would put armed guards that shoot on site coupled with a mine field if they had this many people entering illegally, btw look at what they do to people that enter Mexico illegally they are not put up with 2 hots and a cot like they do in the U.S.
Positive We didn't cancel when Obama was (small p for ) President. He led the way for not being one
Negative John Garrison they dont want to
Negative That's terrible. Instead of the wall, a better idea is to allocate resources towards stopping Nazi meth biker gangs and incel-shooters born in the US. Pay attention to stats instead of anecdotal evidence. Drunk driving is unique to immigrants, and US citizens don't do it?

Keep in mind(,if you have one, or can find it) that Trump is not a politician, and is the main reason Trump is President. Politicians lie honey Trump has proven himself to be a man of his word.

Positive Anyone who opposes securing our southern border is a traitor this nation!
Positive I hate this argument.  Don't get me wrong - America should get her beautiful southern border wall...  But this argument is entirely emotional - there is no rationality to it whatsoever...  Then again people are emotional beings - this kind of message may be an essential part of a rhetorical arsenal.... but I still hate it...
Negative If walls didn't work why do all those demoasses have walls around their homes. The United states can not take on the whole world at one time. If the wall allows that, build it.
Positive My father was also killed by an illegal immigrant on February 17, 2017. We must have the wall and deportation!
Negative People love addressing every negative encounter theyve had with anyone that looks Mexican.  Can we address police killing people along with mass shooters?  Pretty sure those problems arent gonna be solved with the wall

Negative HERE ARE THE NUMBERS WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND: Yale University released a study (October of 2018) by three researchers, all of them liberal I believe, who concluded the actual number of illegal aliens in this country is not 11 million--it's north of 22 million. Twenty-two million.  The Democrat Party is now, as a matter of policy, calling for the legalization of ALL illegals in this country, citizenship voting rights. 22 million new voters. The overwhelming majority of first-time immigrant voters vote Democrat.   The largest margin in American presidential history was 17 million votes in a 1984 election between Mondale and Reagan. 17 million. You would add to our voter roles 22 million at least permanent electoral majority, in perpetuity.  That's what this (this insane resistance against President Trump and his call for building a southern border wall) is all about. It's not about making the country better, serving our labor needs, and helping the population. It's about putting Democrats in power, FOREVER.

Negative For the safety of all Americans build the wall!
Negative just look at britain if you dont believe him, we are fucked

I think a white man just killed five co-workers and injured fire police officers...mmmm
Positive Secure our border and prevent criminals from being exported to our shores
Positive Excellent Mr President
Positive BUILD THAT DAM WALL FAST.
Positive MISTER PRESIDENT! OVER HERE
Positive " 'I didnt need to do this,' President Trump insisted at a Rose Garden appearance on Friday, as he declared a national emergency aimed at shaking loose a few billion dollars in financing for his beloved border wall.  "The presidents assertion was both ludicrous and self-defeating. If a declaration was unnecessary and the wall on track (the wall is 'very very on its way,' the president said earlier in the week), how could he claim to be addressing an emergency? As Mr. Trump explained it, 'But Id rather do it much faster.' A presidential desire for speed does not constitute a crisis  no matter how eager a president is to camouflage his failures." - NYT Editorial Board  "This weeks bipartisan spending bill, which contained no more wall money than the one over which Mr. Trump shut down the government in December, was a particularly humiliating defeat.  "Desperate to save face, the president and his team cooked up a nonemergency emergency with the aim of seizing funds already appropriated for other purposes. Currently, the plan is to pull $2.5 billion from the militarys drug interdiction program, $3.6 billion from its construction budget and $600 million from the Treasury Departments drug forfeiture fund. The White House plans to 'backfill' the money it is taking from the Pentagon in future budgets.  "And so, in a breathtaking display of executive disregard for the separation of powers, the White House is thumbing its nose at Congress, the Constitution and the will of the American people, the majority of whom oppose a border wall.  "Even as he spun this as an act of strong leadership, Mr. Trump acknowledged that his declaration resolves nothing and creates a host of legal, legislative and political troubles." - NYT Editorial Board  https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/opinion/trump-border-wall-national-emergency.html
Negative Resign!
Negative This is so easy to solve this problem. No wall needed. Just stop giving them free EVERYTHING and they will stop coming.

Positive Last year, a Canadian man stabbed a Michigan police officer.  Donald J. Trumps failure to declare a national emergency and fund construction of a wall along the northern border is inconsistent with his recent assertions to the American people.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1GY00I
Positive Dems seems to forget about all the people affected by illegal immigrants. From murders, robberies, illegal driving to identify theft and all the companies who pay illegal immigrants under the table to avoid paying taxes. These people who come in illegally cost the US billions of dollars.  But dems would rather let them in to illegally vote in elections.  We need to be safe!  Walls work!

Then lets take your money and pay for all the death cause by the illegals and for all the pain. Want about the over Crowded schools the medical thats payed for by the american tax payers.

Positive I with President  Trump  100%
Positive Kimberly Danik We need to move on...Obummer did his dirty work, now we have to do EVERYTHING in our power to fight back, make America stronger again whatever it takes, so join American organizations, make new friends and strengthen the bonds of old friendships, buy American, support all things American, vote for Republicans across the boards, and run for local offices whenever possible, have meetings, conversations, celebrations, f2f positive interactions with anyone and everyone and discuss what is happening in our country, encourage each other, write letters, sign petitions, get involved in your local schools, churches, Vet groups, hospitals, nursing homes, etc, etc, this is the way we are going to #bebest, to achieve what the POTUS asked of us in his SOTU speech, to be excellent in all we say and do, and to unite for the sake of our future. I personally am going to become a foster/adoptive parent now, and hope to influence many kids over the next 10, 20 30 years or however long I have, caring for them and teaching them all the great American values that will enable them to become great citizens of our great country. Also, I have started to write down any pertinent names, info, addresses, email, phone #'s and I contact the appropriate offices, when I learn about any person, entity, politician or group who are doing anything I feel is harmful to our American way of life and freedom. For instance I have been writing, calling and signing petitions to have traitors such as Rashida Talib and Ilhan Omar and also Linda Sosaur ousted from their positions, and at least bring attention to them that shows how many citizens want something to be DONE about their slanderous and evil words, behaviors and deeds. It has to stop, and the majority of American citizens feel this way, or else Trump would not have won the election. There are MILLIONS of us who can do these things that I am talking about, and these are respectful, legitimate and peaceful ways to get our point across and to get results. I hope you will join my efforts, thank you and may God be with us! 
Negative How about this: at you next rally and press conference about the Wall, you display large photos of everyone killed by an illegal with their date of death printed on them for ALL the press and people to see.  To finally drive a nail into the idiots that refuse to see the need for the Wall.
Negative So sorry for your loss. Yes President Trump needs to finish the wall!

Negative Here's a true story and a very sad one at that.  A few years ago in my city, a young mother was viciously gunned down by her own father who had snuck back into this country after already being deported.  He snuck in and killed his own daughter all because he felt disrespected because she was dating an older man.  So yeah, I'm all for the wall.
Positive Build the wall! Prayers for all!
Positive Amnesty for all!
Negative It seems to be your only priority.  Hate wont bring them back. Guns in the hands of Americans kill more people than undocumented immigrants. That is our national emergency.
Positive So many sheeps in this post
Positive A+
Negative You distort the risks as you exploit personal tragedy, all because your position 'Tests well'. History will judge you harshly.
Negative The Great Wall of China, is a model to us with many lesson; including the story of the King of China who  had a kite maker killed and his kite burned, so that no one would ever fly over THE WALL !  ...there are more important problems in America and a Wall is not really going to help much !
Negative When I post on here !! I hope im giving you good advice. If you want to end this Socialist calling card. That the Democrats are using as a tactic.They want to attract people who are living paycheck to paycheck. You have a history of renting properties. Affordable housing is a major problem. It is swinging hard working Americans to the left. You could ruin this for Nancy and her crew. You could be the champion of the working poor. You need to start a program to subsidize rent based on income. You could fund it by putting a small tax on All rental properties and corperations, sales tax ect. I think this country would be behind you on this 100%. Id be glad to add one dollar to my monthly rent to pay for this. So would big corperations. Why ?? because it would help everyone to have a nice place to call home. It also could be used to provide housing for the chronic homeless people and vets. The Dems have painted you as this rich arrogant monster. This could be applied to home buyers also. You are a great leader. Show the American people how great a leader Donald J. Trump can be ~~ God Bless
Positive we'll save you some crumbs
Negative Trump is doing what no president would of done!
Positive My heart is broken for you. It is past time to have this issue addressed and the criminals handled and our American laws enforced!
Negative Why doesnt he ever post articles about all of the victims of gun violence by white men?
Negative What kills me is most of these morons live in a gated apartment or neighborhoods that say walls don't work
Negative Some of the points on here are good ones. But the big point that some don't want to see. If we was not spending billions and billions a year on illegals. That would be money that could be used to help people with medical issues. Help vets. Help the homeless. We are spending billions a year on people who have not brought so much as a soda pop In this country. As for the water in Michigan. It was a problem long before trump was elected. If the voters in Michigan would quit voting the same people in that got them in this mess. Just maybe things would get fixed. Your water problems are controlled by your local government not the president.
Positive Trump hires undocumented workers? Just five of the 565 companies in President Trumps business empire are signed up to use E-Verify, the governments best tool to weed illegal immigrants out of the workforce, according to a Washington Times analysis that suggests the president could personally be doing more on that front. Mr. Trumps golf courses in Charlotte, Los Angeles and Miami, his hotel in Washington, D.C., and a hotel he operated in New York are signed up. But his marquee Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida is not signed up, nor are his golf courses in Virginia, Philadelphia or Bedminster, New Jersey  where, The New York Times reported Thursday, some illegal immigrants have been working for years. One of them, Victorina Morales, a Guatemalan woman who jumped the border in 1999, has been at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster for more than five years, making Mr. Trumps bed, cleaning his toilet and dusting his golf trophies, the newspaper reported.

Positive 45 is a sick psycho who is a malignant narcissist,  mysogynist,  child raper!!!
Negative The true enemy of the people is the state.  We'll never defeat our oppressors divided.  Police are the protectors of the elite rich top 1 percent.  Bankers bought their power over the us government when they established the federal reserve.  We're tricked into hating each other for skin color,religion differences,  and political views.   Statism is slavery  Taxation is theft  We're all servants to the state.  The government is our God.  Try to opt out of paying taxes,or a traffic ticket.  Everything is enforced by state violence via cops.
Negative Tudy you beat me to it. You're exactly right. We have enough criminals, we don't need any more.
Negative Build that wall and let the Socialist Democrats FALL
Positive Jennifer Luthye thats the same thing. And is not what I said. I do not believe using immigration status as a reason someone would have lived or died.
Positive Five people died yesterday because a man got a gun legally that wasnt supposed to have it.Fake president fake crisis
Positive Mr. President,
Positive Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher.
Negative How many have been killed by white right wing terrorists?

Positive An illegal alien driving a loaded simi ass-ended a line of cars stopped at a road repair who were waiting on the pilot car to get through. The older couple in the last car in line was smashed into a pickup. The pickup smashed into the back of a loaded cattle trailer and was deflected into the ditch. The older couples car was then smashed flat between the oncoming simi and the stopped simi and were killed instantly. The truck driver was an illegal and was burned in the crash. He was taken into custody and transported to OKC for treatment. There was never any news of what was done with him but I imagine he was released and hauled ass for Mexico leaving Americans with the medical bills and funeral expenses.

Positive Tell me about all the Americans that have performed massive killings, mass murders. Then they just say they have mental problems. I bet we have to build a wall around their houses as well.
Negative But the USMCA is not in effect yet also U.S.-Mexico trade has been duty free for decades and the USMCA keeps it that way
Positive BUILD THE WALL NOW!
Negative Trump is 100% correct, keep them out with a wall !!
Positive Los  Angeles Times  03/04/2008  ""Stanford University called about Jamiel Shaw a week or so ago, intrigued by the slight but speedy running back for Los Angeles High School, the Southern League's most valuable player last year. Rutgers University called a few days later. The Shaw family already had reason to be proud. Jamiel's mother, Army Sgt. Anita Shaw, was on her second tour of duty in Iraq. On Sunday night, it was Jamiel's father on the phone and then his son's girlfriend, Chrystale Miles. Jamiel Sr. called to tell him to hurry home from the mall. The 17-year-old boy was three doors away when someone (Pedro Espinoza ) shot him to death while he was still talking on his cellphone to Chrystale,  Jamiel Sr. heard the shots almost as soon as he hung up. He ran out of the house, raced around the corner and found his son lying on the sidewalk, bleeding."  "Los Angeles police officials described the killing as random and senseless, cutting down a youth who had been doing everything right in his life -- from hitting the books to never missing church to inspiring the Los Angeles High Romans to last year's Southern League title. A police spokeswoman said two Latino men pulled up in a car, jumped out, asked Jamiel if he belonged to a gang, and shot him when he didn't answer. She said Jamiel was not affiliated with a gang". "The youth's football coach, Hardy Williams, was with the family Monday at their 5th Avenue home, where Jamiel's trophies and medals lined the mantel. His 9-year-old brother, Thomas, wore Jamiel's favorite Atlanta Braves cap. Tears flowed. "He was a very special kid," Williams said. "Not only was he an outstanding athlete, he was a good person. I've never seen Jamiel mad. He had such a big smile." The coach described his standout player as "a Houdini on the football field," and the numbers backed it up. As a junior, Jamiel rushed for more than 1,000 yards last year, averaging just over 14 yards per carry. An invitational All-City first-team selection, he scored 11 touchdowns, returned punts and kickoffs, and played defensive back. He also competed in track. Hours before he was shot, Jamiel had spent the day at a football camp at Pasadena City College, Williams said. "Stanford just called me about his transcripts," he said. "Rutgers called a couple of days ago. He was just on track. . . . He was very elated." He is not elated anymore. He is dead. Rotting under six feet of dirt, Donald Trump is his only voice. He speaks for the Dead.
Positive Ummmm......y'all do know that MOST illegals are people who overstayed their visas, right?  What is the wall supposed to do again? Ya know, with them already here? 
Positive 100% truth
Positive Keep it up mr president! The right Choices aren't always popular! Your protecting us from drugs, drug dealers, rapists, killers/ cop killers. Keep it up, keep making America great again. I believe your doing a  great job.
Positive Comrade stooge motherfucka individual 1 made the greatest declaration of a national emergency in American history the emergency at the southern border is way more serious than the 911 attacks and if anyone says otherwise just ask the angel dads and moms #TFA #GoBackToRussiaTraitor #HateHasNoHomeHere
Positive So sad!!  We must work to stop this!!  The wall will help!!!
Negative More people are killed by American citizens than immigrants,the wall is pointless
Positive God bless you, President Trump, for ALL you do for us. I pray for you and your family and those working to help you save our wonderful, free country every day. You are doing a phenomenal job under idiotically difficult circumstances!!!   
Positive Many, one could say it's the addicts fault but I wouldn't. The facts are 90% of herion come across the southern border.
Negative Need To Impeach
Positive Bbuild now
Negative We have 535 politicians that need be deceased.

Negative Get the walls built!
Negative A american killed my cousin we need to build a wall around him I guess smh you people are puppets..most of the crime committed in this country past and present has been committed by Americans especially white..I'm just stating facts guys not racial at all
Positive Sorry for your loss, but Trump is not the answer.
Positive Waste of a life... how many more die while Dems debate... blood on their hands
Positive The reason why libs don't admit this as an issue is because they killed all of their children before any illegals got around to it.
Positive Im so very sorry.
Negative Link Lindquist this post is not about immigrants, its about illegal aliens
Negative Curtis Treat thats terrible!!
Positive Joe Jimenez And a black guy killed how many yester at his job? Just trying to point out what a total idiot you truly are in life! You don't have any friends at all huh?I wonder why? Freaking loser!
Positive So if he had traveled here legally, drank a bunch of beers, ran two red lights, and hit his daughter...she would still be alive? Do beers make you more drunk if your an illegal immigrant?  Trying to find the correlation to his status as an illegal immigrant and her dying due to blunt force trauma from being hit by a car.  Do we know that this guy didnt come legally and just stay longer than his visa allowed and that is how he became an illegal immigrant? How would a wall have stopped that?
Positive Now Is too late.  ///:
Negative If these democrats that are against bullding the wall ,have never had any thing to happen to their families, if something was to happen to them you could hear them all the way to Washington ,wanting something done for protection.
Negative What about all the white nationalist shootings in the past couple years? Fuckin idiots...
Positive We are withYou, Mr President Donald J. Trump, All ways and Always...
Positive However the crime rate is lower by illegal immigrants than by legal citizens.
Negative What about husbands who beat their wives? Should they be in the White Houseyou filthy piece of trash.
Positive You can not blame EVERY illegal immigrant for your loss...NO WALL
Positive U covered up the rape of a 4 year old girl by officer Jose Nunez. U covered up the rape of a 4 year old girl. U protected a child molester. All u care about is money. U say and do anything as long as it fits your agenda.  #TrumpIsABitch
Negative Funny how all the mass shootings are done by white people ,but you think the danger comes from across the border idiots.
Positive So what's the problem completing the border wall? Most if not all of us have some walls around our homes. If they are not complete then anyone can get into our backyard and break in right? It's really common sense folks. It's not we are wasting 5.75 Billion but just enough to finish building the border walls.
Positive oh! is this the best movie of 2020
Positive ONE more of American life lost is already enough... UNACCEPTABLE Stop the genocide of our people.
Positive EL chapo schould pay for the wall..
Positive You'll get it done. I'm pulling for you, and I'm also going to vote for you in 2020. Keep up the great work, and God bless you and your family, Mr. President!
Positive You need to put some ointment on that burnt ego
Positive Trump's main point of being elected and if elected by the people of United States of America was to build a wall he got elected, hes gonna build the wall! That's what the people who voted him in want!!  It is in no way what's in "HIS" best interests, it's what's in the best interests of the "people" who voted him in! Also - allowing ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION is not in in the constitution, trust me I checked twice. So he's not subverting the constitution in any way.... just saying
Positive Man...... let it go dude
Negative Taylor Embree, killed by a three time deported illegal DUI convict; Bakersfield, CA.   This bullshit has to stop.  The American people have had enough.
Positive James Ellis thank you Mr no profile
Positive Oh, well if that happened once then Im convinced.  Its s national emergency. 
Positive Walls with remote machine gun turrets work better!
Positive White supremacist and other far-right extremist groups have killed 51 police officers since 1990, according to a report published by the Anti-Defamation League last week. Left-wing extremist groups, including black nationalists, killed 11 during the same period.  In 2017 alone, black nationalists and other leftists killed no police, while white supremacists and anti-government extremists fatally attacked a police officer and two corrections officers, the report said.  But while the FBI tracks so-called black identity extremists as domestic terror threats  as an FBI counterterrorism report completed in August and leaked in October revealed it doesnt have an equivalent designation for white extremists.  Experts worry that the broad labeling of black groups, and not white ones, is an indication that federal law enforcements targeting of certain groups is based less on evidence than on politics.  https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article196423174.html
Negative A wall will not stop drugs and illegals, but it is a place to start.  When you want to fix a problem, start with the first step.  Build a wall.
Negative Don't forget the millions of displaced American workers due to the foreigner invasion.
Negative When it finally happens to the DEMS families, then they will realize how ignorant they are for not wanting the borders safe.
Positive Diane Edwards Linton so the gun walks up to people and shoot themselves?
Negative Did you hear about Aurora illinois shooting yesterday asshole? Guess what, he was legal and with a felony and somehow he bought a gun.  How your stupid wall is going to solve that ?
Positive An illegal alien bastard murdered my godson.  May all MS-13 animals rot in hell.  I stand with the President.  BUILD THE WALL...and crime will fall.
Positive This wall is not necessary! Trump said that it is not an emergency!!!! He just needs to satisfy his nit wit base or he is TOAST!
Positive Cindy Sak Nowak obviously your comprehensive skills are based on Fictional world's where the same cops that you idiots are calling oppressors and murderers all of a sudden become your protectors when law abiding citizens have no guns. Get a clue
Positive In Germany dies people about illegal immigrants too.
Negative Protecting Americans when u r threatening to release 800 isis fighters? So our children (not yours of course) fought and died for what? And those left To live and fight these guys again?  ISIS-controlled territory is shrinking in Syria, and President Trump is declaring a military victory over the terrorist group. But there is another front growing in West Africa.
Negative An illegal immigrant cut my lawn we dont need a wall
Negative How sad
Negative round up all the illegal Aliens and detain the ones who allowed them to enter and stay.
Positive Well a white guy killed my relatives.
Positive Spreading fears. Wow, how stupid you all are. We do have Americans who kill other Americans too! Quacking, quacking, and quacking.

Positive Blame a whole nation for one shitty situation.. yeah seems fair.. dumbass
Negative What is justified doesnt need to be justified....
Positive Wealthy people have walls around their mansions ~ of course walls work. There would be no angel moms if we had a border wall because illegals could not get in the USA to kill Americans. #BuildTheWallNow!
Positive And people complained when the democRATs used the deaths of children to further their agenda...
Positive LIAR!  LIAR!  Over 20,000 Americans are murdered by fellow Americans EVERY year!  Build a wall around that you fat MORON! 
Positive I just reread your post ,dont really know what you are getting at.so if I offered you sorry.
Positive Keep up the good work
Negative we need more than a,wall... we need to use snipers and deadly force...
Positive MAGA!!!!
Positive Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin opinion vs fact of a billionaire that works for free..1) Economic Growth  ~4.2 percent growth in the second quarter of 2018.  ~For the first time in more than a decade, growth is projected to exceed 3 percent over the calendar year.
Negative We have a big rat infestation in the "halls of Congress", Globo. Rat. Defined as rodents who are for open borders, Global governance of all nations by one central command and leadership, George Bush, called it The New World Order, and both Demarats, and Rhino crats as well as non party players are against our President!
Positive An illegal immigrant killed my father in 1991.

THIS IS MORE THAN JUST AN EMERGENCY FOLKS ... we need more than just the border wall .. https://blogs-images.forbes.com/doliaestevez/files/2015/11/DEA-Map-1-1200x958.jpg
Negative I love border Lies https://www.facebook.com/georgehtakei/videos/vb.205344452828349/568194156980132/?type=2&theater
Negative Walls can easily be overcome. Very stupid. Dig under. Use a ladder and go over it.  Its just so stupid.
Positive Sandra Nastasi Gaston what invasion?
Negative now if it was a demovrat president no one would say anything if he wanted a wall  they would all agree but since its a republician pres its a different story
Negative Matt McNamee Nic Harcus
Positive Walls work.
Negative Except for the fact that, you know, a wall would of prevented it....
Positive Point is we don't want to add to the criminal element already here! Come here legally  -  PERIOD!!!!!
Negative Rafael Garcia Hector David Murguia Gastelum
Positive I will Help with the Wall tell me where and when
Negative Sorry for your loss however government statistics show more people are killed by the general population than by undocumented immigrants
Negative https://www.westernjournal.com/ct/obamas-national-emergencies-went-double-digits-still-effect/ congress does not care about the people who elected them. They did not question the crap obama called national emergencies
Positive Trevor Valescu Bc be likes to see autists flip their lid the moment he does something they dont like.
Negative Yesterday, an illegal was driving recklessly and killed a guy changing his tire on the side of the road. We are a sanctuary state so the illegal will likely walk free.
Positive And what are you going to do to protect American families from getting shot by a crazy American gun lover?
Positive Wall
Positive Build The Wall Mandatory E-verify Pass RAISE NumbersUSA.com
Positive How will you continue to blame immigrants for everything after the wall?
Negative we know we need it...that's why we voted for you...be the dictator they think you are and get it done and then step down..you're the only one who cares about us
Positive Americans face consequences,  illegals do not.  They get deported only to run right back.  And....how many children are trafficked across that border every year?
Positive Aurora, Parkland, Newtown, Charleston, Las Vegas, Columbine, Pittsburgh Synagogue, Sutherland, Aurora, etc etc etc etc etc etc et etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc incidents of mass murder...  THiSis the National Emergency...not the border
Positive I have a friend whose grandson was just struck while riding his bike by an illegal driver who was drunk.  He survived, but has broken bones.  He is young, and most probably will have problems for the rest of his life. I lost my sissy to murder in 2009. The only thing that would have made the grief more unbearable, would be if she had been murdered by someone who wasn't even suppose to be in the country!  They are not sending their finest to America, and there are terrorists coming over that border too!  WE NEED TO BE SECURE!
Positive "Against that backdrop, it was Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood) and former state Senate leader Kevin de Len who first began to chart the states course in confronting Washington, releasing a joint statement the day after the 2016 presidential election declaring California the new keeper of the nations future.  If CA is indicative of the "nations future" the USA is doomed. President Trump is astute to this snd trying to stop it.   newsom is a weak, naive, puppet for the "anchor baby politicians in CA, who are favoring ILLEGALS over US CITIZENS. I hope the Feds cut off $$ to CA, it's the only hope to stop the insanity.   http://enewspaper.latimes.com/infinity/article_share.aspx?guid=97518f04-32d5-446a-b4fe-54e87a09a237
Positive You see it all most everyday were illegal kills ,rape children, rape women, and kill law enforcers.
Positive If families or mothers are called angel families & angel mothers of those killed by illegal aliens. What are the parents/families/mothers of those killed by American citizens referred to as? If ICE & Border patrol would do their jobs & if American citizens would stop using drugs & if companies would stop hiring illegals (like Trump) we wouldnt have a problem. Five year olds killed at Sandy Hook & Vegas concert massacre & Parkland. What are these families called? SOL???
Negative Of course, nobody on THIS side of the wall will kill anyone, right?
Positive As for Mexuco not paying it...oh they will.Now they have to take care of the people that live there because they cant get here.The funny thing is they didnt want the caravans going thru either and lol the people in Mexico were protesting the fact they were invaded.Aint that a kicker
Positive You are the EMERGENCY. Putins puppet.
Positive Mass shootings occurred the other day and you still do nothing
Negative Don't worry you will do it to yourselves what's been done by immigrants, dishonest Americans who are thinking everyone is after them like the revelation 2,9 and 3,9 you will come to worship song of Solomon 1.5,6
Negative I'm more than disappointed in the GOP, especially Rand Paul! Stop playing fair with them! They're not fair with you or us! Start naming names and exposing them every time they vote against you! Tell it all! You're entirely too kind, sir.
Positive Pat are you retarded invite them to your house I dare you
Positive FYI!
Negative This illegal should be hung !
Positive How many illegal immigrants committed mass murder or even murder as compared to home grown American men?  Lets start by throwing you out!
Negative WHAT ABOUT THE BIGGER PROBLEM THE GUN MASS MURDERS.
Positive And of the 5 Americans gunned down yesterday..?
Positive Why do Democrats idolize and protect illegal alien killers?
Negative Well said to hear and see for sure but bad news from TEXAS MAGA country.  El Paso has filed a law suit against Trump  I thought there was a HUGE Rally ?  well yes they were bused in true  Gov't has taken acres of land from an old couple to put up a fence they don't want.  What is going on is the Texas Romance over ??
Positive Ahmad Mahmoud Ouch! That hurt! Smh
Negative Too bad it wasnt one of theirs.
Positive Fucking liar! You are using the personal tradgity of others for political gain. That is all you are doing. There have been thousands of Americans and continue to be every day who are gunned down before their lives ever begin and you speak out when on that? Never!  Again, you are simply using the personal suffering of American families for your personal political gains and you are a slime ball and a disgusting fake slime ball at that!
Negative One of sister's best friends was killed by an illegal immigrant.  There were 3 illegals in the car.  The driver never even slowed down at the stop sign on a side highway and was speeding.  He hit her while she was driving the speed limit of 65.  She was life watched but didn't survive long.  The 3 men weren't even injured.  They had no insurance and actually tried to hire an attorney to sue the husband of the woman he killed.  They got out of jail somehow and fled back to Mexico.  I always wonder how long it took them to cross back into the states and how many other crimes they've committed since then.
Positive After living near the border and knowing people who worked for border patrol it would be wiser to bring the military home and put them on the border and get rid of the bad border patrol  !  He would win on two fronts bringing military home and saving money because they are home and can be near families and it would be better then the wall.  They should sell all majuana  to place selling it legally to raise money for wall and anyone bringing hard drugs should face a firing squad that will stop drugs and he would be re-elected.
Positive DJ Trump and MC Pence!
Positive Keep wall up
Positive Agree 100%, Most Americans Are Truly Sorry For Your Loss, I Back Our President And The Wall Is Critical For The Safety And Security Of All Americans. Im An American Hispanic Deplorable And Wear The Label Proudly 
Negative I'm sure if a family member of theirs was raped or tortured or murdered they would be singing a different tune! They're only concern is for their own agenda! They do not care about the American people one iota! It sickens me that innocent lives are destroyed by the illegal actions of these illegal immigrants! I am so sorry to anyone who has been affected by this travesty of justice.
Positive Trump2020!
Negative I  REALLY  PRAY PRESIDENT  TRUMP GETS THIS  MESSAGE.  IN DELAWARE WHERE I LIVE,  TWO  WEEKS  AGO  THERE WAS  AN  INCIDENT  TO WHERE  AND  ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WAS INVOLVED  AND  THE  DELAWARE  STATE  POLICE WAS  INVOLVED,  AS  ONE  OF THE  OFFICERS  ARRIVED I  TOLD HIM  THE  GUY  IN  THERE IS  ILLEGAL  IMMIGRANT  AND THIS  OFFICERS  EXACTS  WORDS WERE   THATS  A  PROBLEM FOR  IMMIGRATION  NOT  US.  NOW  WHY  ISNT  LAW  INFORCEMENT  DOING MORE? PLUS  I HAVE A  NAME  OF  ANOTHER  ILLEGAL  IMMIGRANT WHICH  WAS INVOLVED  IN  DOMENSTIC ABUSED  CASE  AND  THIS PERSON  WENT  TO  A  DELAWARE  FAMILY  COURT  UNDER  AND ILLEGAL  NAME, SSI ETC  BEING  USED  AND  THE  JUDGE WAS INFORMED  OF THIS PERSON  BEING  ILLEGAL,  WELL  GUESS  WHAT,  NO  OTHER  QUESTIONS WERE  ASKED AND  NOTHING WAS DONE. I FEEL AS THOUGHOUR  PRESIDENT AND  US AMERICANS  WHO ARE  DOING  OUR  BEST  OF  FIGHTING  IMMIGRATION ARE GETTING  NO  HELP  OR  SUPPORT FROM EVEN OUROWN LAWS, POLICE, COURTS  AND/OR  JUDGES.  PRESIDENT  TRUMP  WHY  ARE WE  NOT  GETTING  THE  HELP  WE NEED?
Negative Charles Landry this is not proof of need for a wall. Illegal immigration happens primarily through Visa overstays and the other issues we have with border security are also largely through ports of entry. This is intended to bolster unthinking response by people who have poor critical thinking skills. It is transparent fear mongering.
Positive I am so sorry for your loss, that illegal would have gotten Italian justice right away no time for American justice today these people get off with a slap on the hand when they commit heinous crimes and it's unacceptable, build the damn wall already.
Positive Walls are stupid, they dont work. Almost all crime is committed by American citizens. How about gun control if you care about our family? What's that? You cant hear me over the sound of counting the 30 million dollars NRA gave you?
Positive This man's story is tragic.  But securing our borders, making sure that criminals are punished and can't get back in does not translate into a physical wall.  4th century solution to a 21st century problem.
Positive WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?????
Positive A white guy killed my family member with a gun.   All i got was thoughts and prayers
Negative Amazing the arrogant, ignorant people that are against the wall are so evil, I can not believe they keep thier positions.
Negative You only want a wall for your own selfishness
Negative An illegal  boy ,Kill my husband , certain people dont get it until God forbid it happens to them loose a person in your. Family .the pain never stop hurting never wish on no one  build  the wall 
Positive You're a jackass.

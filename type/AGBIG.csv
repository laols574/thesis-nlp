"I was working for an employer who had hired illegal immigrants and didn't notify the staff that had been working there. One of the younger a_ _ holes invited me out to his place for a beverage, the boss's son even said he'd be there so I thought nothing of it (we both were young and he wasn't bad looking) so I kindly accepted the offer (2nd mistake) 1st was even talking to him in the 1st place. We planned a time and he gave me the address, now keep in mind I was currently residing in a smaller town where at this younger age it didn't seem to be an issue to go to someone's place.  Upon arriving I had to go through a cattle gate, house was out in the country, upon arriving to the house, there were more guys out there than I had originally thought there would be. I then decided that MAYBE this just wasn't a good idea and I was trying to leave in my car, never had gotten outside of it. I found out that there were a couple of men outside and they had chain locked the gate closed and I NOT wanting to destruct property, demanded they open the gate. No one would open the gate, one other guy had made his way into my car and forced me over and drove me back to the house where there were 7 maybe 8 illegal immigrants and a 50+ yr old Male who MIGHT have been a U.S. resident. They dragged me into the home where they forced themselves on me, forced liquor down my throat and then proceeded to take me into a bedroom where I continued to fight them off of me, one by one they all took turns, they all were all over me and it then became a group thing, I fought and fought what seemed like hours, once everyone had their fun, I managed to crawl myself into the bathroom, near the bedroom I was in and in there the 50 yr old man put me into the shower, by know the liquor had kicked in and I was pretty much a lump on a log. So I was finished off in a shower with this horrible 50+ yr old and left alone once all were done having there fun. I yelled and screamed I kicked and clawed I threw punches I even tried to bite, by the time I came too I was naked in a cold shower and even though I was still pretty well lit, I was able to get just enough on to get myself out of the house and my keys and get in my car where I was able to then escape any future sexual assaults. I wasn't even sure if I was going to be held longer or released. I tried to file charges, but after that night all men were on the run including the older man himself. So nothing had ever come of it other than me getting counseling. BELIEVE WE HAVE TO BUILD THIS WALL TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN.  I would NEVER wish a gang bang on even my worst enemy. I have gone through counseling and I have over come my situation. I have a daughter now, and I fear that she NEVER EVER endures such a HORRIBLE HORROR.  This happened about 12 years ago, but it has only gotten worse  since then with the population of illegals.

"Imagine if there was not a wall! What would happen? Probably, and Im just speculating here, that illegals would simply walk across and enter our country and disappear. Illegal and undocumented, and unable to find work, they would either simply exist off tax payer dollars, straining our system, or commit crimes to get money. All the while  our vets and homeless continue to suffer, living on the streets and in makeshift shelters. And sanctuary cities and states increase your taxes to provide illegals with free benefits - food, housing, medical and education while ignoring our citizens first! This is wrong. If they seriously want to better Their lives, do so legally and obey our laws. Is this what we want America to become? Is this why some support santuary cities and states?   Consider this last point. All countries across this planet use some type of a physical border, barrier or even a simple sign post to let you know that you are entering their country. They do this for many obvious reasons, one of which is to inform you that you have crossed into their sovereignty and that you must obey the laws of their land.  Same here when you think about the continental US, between states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii). Each state has boundary lines established - sign posts and in some cases check points to let you know that you are entering theyre state and that different state laws are in effect, that different state taxes may be in effect et cetera. If borders do not matter, then why would states need them, or why should their be any localized laws  of any kind in place?

"I won't deny the fact that America has a gun problem, though we can't act like illegal immigration isn't an issue.  While not every immigrant is a threat to society, we cannot deny the fact some of them are, even if they're a minority. Some are even wanted criminals.  Not to mention that if Orange-man were to actually implement stricter firearm control, there would still be a lot of contraband crossing the border because of the lack of immigration control. Not just drugs, but unlicensed weapons as well.  They're basically fuel for the black market which puts unlicensed weapons in the wrong hands. this in itself is valid reason to encourage possession of a firearm to protect one's self against this threat.  I think that fixing (or at least minimizing) the contraband problem is the first step towards implementing a better, more efficient gun control project since the population will feel more secure.  Whether building a wall is the best solution is up for debate. On the surface it looks extreme, but we won't know its efficiency until it's finalized. Until then, people will have a valid argument to defend both the second amendment and the wall.

By then it's to late to respond with corrective action. ...in this case America is the ""body"" and drugs are killing the body. Over the years it's only getting worse. They say they will stop it with legislation but never really stop it. The addict is going to allow themselves to die and the members of the body are sort of not wanting to let that happen.

"We were hit from behind while on the way to work. The driver of the other car, an older white woman, pulled up beside us and shouted that she was going to pull off to the side of the road. Then she turned off her lights so we couldn't see her license plate, and drove off. Our car was destroyed, and I required medical attention, and she just left us there. Another time an older white woman wrecked our car, and hers, by making a left turn from the right lane without looking. She then, unsuccessfully, tried to convince the police it was our fault. Another older white woman backed into my car in a parkinglot, denting in the front and breaking my headlight. Despite doing this in front of a police officer, she hit the gas and sped off. When they caught her we discovered she didn't have insurance. Once, when driving a work truck on the interstate, an older white man became enraged because I wasn't driving fast enough in the fast lane. I had to be in that lane because my exit was coming up off of it, and I had to slow down to 60 because my truck wouldn't have made the turn otherwise. He sped up, cut in front of me, and slammed on his breaks. Somehow I managed to stop in time. If my truck hadn't been empty, I would have certainly hit him, and we both could have been killed. I have never had an unpleasant encounter of any kind with an immigrant, legal or otherwise. Middle-aged white people are another story.",25.666666666666668,Facts/Logic,original post,yes

"My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street.

The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputys car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated.

Everyone agrees something needs to be done just some of us see the wall as a waste of money from a man that promised Mexico would pay for it.

"Mr. Donald John Trump our President Of The United States Of America never chose to be a common man. It is his right to be uncommon. He seeks the opportunity to develop whatever talents God gave him. Not security for his family. Security of the United States Of America. He does not wish to be a kept citizen. Humbled and dulled by having the state look after him. He wants to take a calculated risk: to dream and to build. To fail and to succeed. He refuses to barter incentive for a dole. He prefers the challenges of life to the guaranteed existence. The thrill of fulfillment to the stale calm of utopia. He will not trade freedom beneficence nor his dignity for a handout. He will never cower before any earthly master nor bend to any threat. It is his heritage to stand erect. proud and unafraid: to think and act himself, enjoy the benefits of his creations and to face the world boldly and say--This with God's help.

Donny doesnt seem terribly concerned about this crisis.  He plans to travel to Florida mere hours after declaring the emergency from the White House. A president, in times of strife, would typically stay in the nations capital to oversee the crisis. Donny plans to do so from the comfort of his weekend getaway.

"BINARY OPTIONS ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT.. Binary options trade has been developing rapidly over the last few years, This innovative approach to global markets allows people to quickly invest and extract profit from their investments without actually buying the asset that interests them. It is the price of these assets that is the focus of attention when dealing with binary options and the only thing people have to do is predict whether it will rise or fall in a certain period of time (Up or down). these are the only two things traders have to worry about, It was never so easy to become a successful trader all you need for success in binary options trading is a well approved broker to invest your money and get back profit in a week time. Your broker plays this role and point you in the right direction from the beginning of trade right up to the cashout of your profit. With a minimum investment of $300 you can make good profit of $3500 and $500 will earn you a profit of $5500 after a trading week.  If you're a newbie or a trader who has been loosing a lot of money recently you can contact me for more info on how you can go about the trading process.",10,Facts/Logic,original post,yes

On Nov. 27, 1944, squad leader Macario Garcia and his platoon were pinned down in Germanys Huertgen Forest, under intense mortar and machine-gun fire. In the unrelenting barrage of the Nazi attack, several of Garcias men were killed or wounded. Garcia himself was hit in the shoulder. He crawled toward nearby underbrush as a machine-gun and various riflemen attempted to finish him off. Garcia was wearing the uniform of an American G.I. He was wearing the dog tags of an American GI. He was leading a squad of American G.I.s. He was not, however, an American citizen. Garcia was an undocumented immigrant. For his actions in the Huertgen Forest  taking out two machine-gun nests single-handedly while seriously wounded, saving the lives of his men and advancing the American position  Macario Garcia was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.

When I ask my self this question. About the wall. And weight out all the pros and cons. I came up with this.  I had a daughter. That was involved in. Human trafficking. She did not even know she was doing it. Because of the drugs and the influence. It had on her. She call us. And wanted to come home for a few days. I knew she was a prostitute. And it was hard to just think that some day Im going to get a phone call. From the police. Saying your daughter is dead. In my heart. Was a broken heart. To think what she was doing. She was MIA. Then out of the blue she called. I asked her questions. How are you. When are you going to come home. She would not say nothing. Out of shame. I would begin to cry. She would say dad dont cry. This is my choice. So I asked her this. What are you doing right now.  She told me. She was at the bus stop. To pick up some girls. From New York. I asked why. Because her pimp wanted her to. I told her. That is human trafficking. She said whats that. And I told her. What human trafficking is. And what happens to girls. She took the girls to a safe house. And she had to stay with them until the pimps. Muscle guys. Came and took him away. She told me they were 12 to 15-year-olds. She never saw those girls again after that night when the muscleman came and took them.  If a wall just stops one of these acts and prevent someone from getting killed from drugs to me its worth having the wall. If they cant come to America legally then they should not come at all does it read those their grandparents or someone they know that wanted to come to America had to either come here legally or illegally. Lives matters. And walls will save lives.,9.666666666666666,Negative tone,original post,yes

He said they get 200 stolen cars a day like this. Not 2 but 200!!! Multiply that by as many as they can stuff in the truck without any seats. Now multiply that by 365 days in a year.

He is a bully.  That is, except when he is among bullies like Putin; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling boot licker instead. The rules of basic decency cannot be found in Trump. He punches downwards  which a gentleman should, would, could never do  and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless  and he kicks them when they are down. The fact that a third of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think Yeah, he seems like my kind of guy is a matter of confusion and distress to people worldwide. There have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid.

Then you began to open my eyes to the corruption that as been in the White House for far too long. Like all business men, your main concern is to protect the company which he has invested into (that being the people of the USA). If walls don't work, then why do we fence in our backyards? (To protect our children from the known dangers of the outside world.) Why do we fence in cattle when it seems inhumane to force an animal to a restricted area? (To protect the investment of their owners and others from harm). Why do we fence in our public schools? (To protect innocent children from savage people who wish unnecessary violence against the future of America). Why do we build retaining walls around our house? (To stop mother nature from destroying our shelter, our home). Why do we build walls around freeways and areas of high traffic? (To protect each other from the negligence of other drivers and to protect our people from hit and runs). Why do we build railings on our bridges? (To protect people from the dangers of failing far far below). Your interest is direct and logical. Let's protect the American people from the dangers of our Southern boarder before the danger/crime/violence happens (Still a little late because there are many of Americans who have lost love ones due to not having a wall). Democrats are doing everything in their power to stop you, don't let them! They are after the votes of the illegals, not the protection of their citizens!

As it turns out, another group you might generally expect to support the president is also less than thrilled with his order: namely, the military itself.  Responding to criticism of the dubious deployment last week, Defense Secretary James Mattis demurred: We dont do stunts in this department. The soldiers being sent to the border are there to provide support to the Department of Homeland Security, just as they often do after natural disasters, Mattis insisted. The secretary did not speak to the question of whether a dwindling caravan of around 3,000 Central American asylum seekers, currently 800 miles from the border and traveling on foot, really merited the same emergency response as a hurricane.  Since then, several reports have come out showing that Trumps original vision for the deployment, tendentiously titled Operation Faithful Patriot, was larger in scope than what the Pentagon ultimately allowed, as some of what the president expected the soldiers to do was at best wasteful and at worst illegal. The administrations first request, CNN reported on Friday, was for soldiers to provide crowd and traffic control and protect Customs and Border Protection personnel, which some Defense officials viewed as law enforcement activities the military is barred by law from performing. That request was rejected, as was a proposal that soldiers construct housing for detained migrants, according to Reuters.",yes

Trumps predilection not to govern, but rather rule by an unprecedented executive fiat, set off alarm bells for Constitutional separation of powers, as Trump departed early Friday for a weekend of golf at Mar-a-Lago.  This week the Mueller probe made news as reporting indicated Trumps former campaign chair Paul Manafort discussed a peace plan for Ukraine and handed off internal polling data in a secretive meeting to a business associate with ties to Russian intelligence, and a search warrant revealed Roger Stone was in direct contact with WikiLeaks while interacting with the Trump campaign  both in the months before the 2016 election.  At a Trump campaign-style event in El Paso, a BBC cameraman was physically assaulted by a supporter  symbolic of Trumps continued attacks on the media and his stoking of hatred against marginalized communities. Trumps speech in El Paso and his declaring a manufactured emergency in Rose Garden were both a repetition of disproven lies and exaggerations, as Trump continues to propagate a dystopian alternate reality and act unilaterally.

As it turns out, another group you might generally expect to support the president is also less than thrilled with his order: namely, the military itself.  Responding to criticism of the dubious deployment last week, Defense Secretary James Mattis demurred: We dont do stunts in this department. The soldiers being sent to the border are there to provide support to the Department of Homeland Security, just as they often do after natural disasters, Mattis insisted. The secretary did not speak to the question of whether a dwindling caravan of around 3,000 Central American asylum seekers, currently 800 miles from the border and traveling on foot, really merited the same emergency response as a hurricane.  Since then, several reports have come out showing that Trumps original vision for the deployment, tendentiously titled Operation Faithful Patriot, was larger in scope than what the Pentagon ultimately allowed, as some of what the president expected the soldiers to do was at best wasteful and at worst illegal.

"Here is a little morning history for you. Very interesting...  Thomas Jefferson His portrait is on the $2.00 Dollar Bill. This is amazing. There are two parts to this. Be sure to read the 2nd part.  Thomas Jefferson was a very remarkable man who started learning very early in life and never stopped. At 5, began studying under his cousin ' s tutor. At 9, studied Latin, Greek and French. At 14, studied classical literature and additional languages At 16, entered the College of William and Mary. Also could write in Greek with one hand, while writing the same in Latin with the other. At 19, studied Law for 5 years starting under George Wythe. At 23, started his own law practice. At 25, was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses. At 31, wrote the widely circulated ""Summary View of the Rights of British America,"" and retired from his law practice. At 32, was a delegate to the Second Continental Congress. At 33, wrote the Declaration of Independence. At 33, took three years to revise Virginia ' s legal code and wrote a Public Education bill and a statute for Religious Freedom. At 36, was elected the second Governor of Virginia, succeeding Patrick Henry. At 40, served in Congress for two years. At 41, was the American minister to France and negotiated commercial treaties with European nations along with Ben Franklin and John Adams. At 46, served as the first Secretary of State under George Washington. At 53, served as Vice President and was elected President of the American Philosophical Society. At 55, drafted the Kentucky Resolutions and became the active head of the Republican Party. At 57, was elected the third president of the United States  At 60, obtained the Louisiana Purchase , doubling the nation ' s size. At 61, was elected to a second term as President. At 65, retired to Monticello. At 80, helped President Monroe shape the Monroe Doctrine. At 81, almost single-handedly, created the University of Virginia and served as its ' first president. At 83, died on the 50th Anniversary of the Signing of the Declaration of Independence, along with John Adams.  Thomas Jefferson knew because he himself studied, the previous failed attempts at government. He understood actual history, the nature of God, His laws and the nature of man. That happens to be way more than what most understand today.  Jefferson really knew his stuff.  A voice from the past to lead us in the future:  John F. Kennedy held a dinner in the White House for a group of the brightest minds in the nation at that time. He made this statement: ""This is perhaps the assembly of the most intelligence ever to gather at one time in the White House, with the exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.""  ""When we get piled upon one another in large cities, as in Europe, we shall become as corrupt as Europe ."" -- Thomas Jefferson  ""The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not."" -- Thomas Jefferson  ""It is incumbent on every generation to pay its ' own debts as it goes. A principle which if acted on, would save one-half the wars of the world."" -- Thomas Jefferson  ""I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people, under the pretense of taking care of them."" -- Thomas Jefferson  ""My reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government."" -- Thomas Jefferson  ""No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms."" -- Thomas Jefferson  ""The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government."" -- Thomas Jefferson  ""The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants."" -- Thomas Jefferson  ""To compel a man to subsidize with his taxes, the propagation of ideas which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical."" -- Thomas Jefferson",15.666666666666666,Facts/Logic,original post,yes

"An emergency declaration ought to be reserved for legitimate emergency situations where quick, decisive action is needed to resolve a crisis.  Trump's failure to win approval for his vanity project does not constitute a national emergency.  Typically, when someone is facing a legitimate emergency, they wouldn't undermine their own argument for exercising emergency powers by admitting that the situation is such that they don't actually need to declare an emergency.  Trump is truly such a special case, that he deftly made the case for his ""emergency"" declaration by admitting, ""I could do the wall over a longer period of time, I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster. And I don't have to do it for the election; I've already done a lot of wall for the election 2020.""  Later in the same address, Trump basically admitted that his emergency declaration will not result in his Wall being built quickly.  If we are genuinely experiencing a border crisis that requires an emergency declaration from Trump, how is it that Trump was able to wait until nearly 25 months into his administration before declaring an emergency?  If the situation is so dire, and requires prompt, decisive action, exactly how will construction of a wall that would take several years to complete address the issue in time?   Sever dehydration is a medical emergency. Would you advise someone suffering from severe dehydration to begin development of a well to deal with their thirst, or would you give them a glass of water?  How do you justify building Trump's Wall to deter border crossings, when apprehensions at the southern border are near a 46 year low?  What good will Trump's Wall do to curb drug smuggling across the border, when both the DEA and the CBP admit that most of the narcotics that cross the southern border come through legal ports of entry?  How effective will Trump's Wall be at preventing undocumented immigrants from entering the country, when the Center for Migration Studies of New York found that in 2016-2017, 62% of the newly undocumented were folks who had overstayed their visas, and not crossed our southern border illegally?   How would Trump's Wall address the refugee crisis, when it won't provide any of the resources needed to process and adjudicate asylum claims, nor will it lead to a resolution of the circumstances refugees are fleeing in their homelands?  ""Build the Wall!"" was never a real solution. It was a slogan.  Trump'a Wall has always been a simplistic remedy offered by an ignorant sleaze in order to appeal to the simple-minded.",20.333333333333332,Affiliation,original post,yes

"Trump chuckled about how his ""bone spurs"" got him out of serving his country in Vietnam so he could play the dating game.  Macario Garcia was a boy of 3 when his parents moved their large family across the Rio Grande from Mexico to work in the fields of South Texas. Thats where the draft board found him, 19 years later, in 1942. Wounded in the Normandy invasion, Garcia recovered in time to rejoin the 22nd Infantry Regiment for its advance through the Hrtgen Forest  some of the most ferocious fighting of the war in Europe. On Nov. 27, 1944, acting squad leader Garcia led his men up a hill toward entrenched German positions. When the first machine guns opened up amid a rain of mortar fire, Garcia ignored severe wounds to his shoulder and ankle to drag himself toward the nest. When he destroyed that position, a second German gunner began firing. Once again, Garcia attacked, silencing the gun and taking four enemy prisoners. Even then, he refused to be carried from the battlefield until he knew the hill had been taken. At a White House ceremony in 1945, Staff Sgt. Garcia became the first Mexican-born soldier to receive the Medal of Honor. A month later, he was denied service at a segregated restaurant south of Houston, and when he refused to leave the premises, the owner beat him with a baseball bat. - WaPo",291.5,Not Counterspeech,original post,no

Trumps predilection not to govern, but rather rule by an unprecedented executive fiat, set off alarm bells for Constitutional separation of powers, as Trump departed early Friday for a weekend of golf at Mar-a-Lago.  This week the Mueller probe made news as reporting indicated Trumps former campaign chair Paul Manafort discussed a peace plan for Ukraine and handed off internal polling data in a secretive meeting to a business associate with ties to Russian intelligence, and a search warrant revealed Roger Stone was in direct contact with WikiLeaks while interacting with the Trump campaign  both in the months before the 2016 election.  At a Trump campaign-style event in El Paso, a BBC cameraman was physically assaulted by a supporter  symbolic of Trumps continued attacks on the media and his stoking of hatred against marginalized communities. Trumps speech in El Paso and his declaring a manufactured emergency in Rose Garden were both a repetition of disproven lies and exaggerations, as Trump continues to propagate a dystopian alternate reality and act unilaterally.

"Tony Lamb .org  I HAD A DREAM!   I have had many end times dreams.   In my dreams I saw the destruction of America. America (Babylon) is Entering Judgement.  I saw nuclear weapons going off in most major American cities. I saw two Asteroids hit the earth. One of these Asteroids caused a Tsunami that was several hundred feet high to hit America's East coast. I saw A mega-earthquake on the west coast that caused two other faults to rip wide open causing another massive Tsunami on the West Coast. Then these earthquakes caused several major Volcanoes to erupt. I saw America ripped in half by the New Madrid fault ripping America in half from the Great Lakes down to New Orleans and this was up to hundreds of miles wide at some points.  America's heartland was turned into a great sea between two continents. And yes I saw Yellowstone erupt with a massive eruption. I was above the earth witnessing all this. But then I zoomed down and in close and I saw civil war in America. I saw Americans shooting and bombing other American's. I saw paper money blowing down the street and no one gave it a thought as it was worthless paper.  Everyone was starving and people were eating bugs, bark, leaves and grass as the hunger was so great. I saw people cooking and eating other people. I saw parents cooking and eating their children. I saw parents trading their children for a hand full of rice or beans. Cannibalism was so rampant that no one gave it a thought as it had become common and normal.   What I saw was in the Great Tribulation and I have had several dreams about this time to come. And my impression was this is NOT off in our distant future but was our near present time. I saw much, much more! The focus was America as America has sinned the most and drug or forced other nations into her abominations. But no part of the earth was spared, every nation, every island, every people, everywhere was touched by this Great Tribulation.  God has reached his limit for tolerating sin. So NOW God acts. The Holy Spirit came to me in a dream and hovered above my bed and spoke 4 words to me. ""AMERICA IS ENTERING JUDGEMENT'. I prayed, I cried and I sobbed, I cried so hard because I knew what was to come.   A great deception will soon manifest and the whole world will be mesmerized by it. The faithful needs to be aware of this and not fall into this trap because many Christians will be deceived by this.   I believe this will be alien disclouser and the fact proposed by the media that aliens seeded life on this planet and they are here to help mankind. These aliens are demons straight from hell and they are NOT here to help mankind but to deceive us.  I saw Fallen Angels walking the earth destroying everything and everyone before them and no weapon could harm them.   REVELATION 9: 14 & 15 14 SAYING TO THE SIXTH ANGEL WHICH HAD THE TRUMPET, LOOSE THE FOUR ANGELS WHICH WERE BOUND IN THE GREAT RIVER EUPHRATES.  15 AND THE FOUR ANGELS WERE LOOSED, WHICH WERE PREPARED FOR AN HOUR, AND A DAY, AND A MONTH, AND A YEAR, FOR TO SLAY THE THIRD PART OF MEN.  This scripture says 4 Fallen Angels will be released upon the earth and will kill a third (1/3) of mankind. (I was shown this verse after my Fallen Angel dream.)  Also a Great Shaking is coming to America soon. I do not know what form this will take, economic collapse, war, Asteroid strike, Earthquake, Super Volcano, Tsunami something big IS COMING. And when it gets here every person in America will be shaken to their very core.  ALSO I know the Rapture is very soon also. I don't know when this will come in relationship to these other events, before, during or after these other events BUT IT IS COMING AND SOON.  So pray, look up for your redemption draweth nigh. BUT we who are faithful in Jesus Christ will be raptured out of here and WE WILL NOT BE HERE for the Tribulation.

"WHY is declaring a National Emergency to address a National Emergency in The United States considered wrong? There are 28 current National Emergencies, most of which involve emergencies in OTHER countries, that were declared by the previous POTUS.     ALL of these so-called declared National Emergencies could be applied to the actions of those people who are ILLEGALLY crossing the Southern Border of the United States of America.   IF apprehensions are down, it is ONLY because of a concerted effort to deter entry, that DETERMENT costs the taxpayer, BILLIONS of dollars each year. The press likes to declare that most drug apprehensions are at legal crossings which is true; however, how do we know how many drugs are successfully transported across our unsecured border every day?      A wall is a realistic, and economic, approach to denying illegal entry into this country.  Why do you think walls there are built around prisons, the Vatican, Israel, ""homes of the rich and famous and most other countries.  BECAUSE the expense of employing many guards with guns to protect 2000 miles of border is TOO expensive and NOT nearly as effective as a wall!    ""The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on United States Taxpayers""  report put the total cost of illegal immigration at $135 billion a year, while claiming undocumented immigrants paid only $19 billion a year in taxes. That leaves a net loss to local, state and federal governments of $116 billion a year.""

How much more does it cost for the gangs that, for me, is walking distance from my house, and all the harm they do every single day. There were over reported 1,000 crimes in the town that was my school district's town last year, about four reported crimes a day. On my way to work, depending on the time of day, there are about fifteen day laborers waiting for off the book work in an area, usually two or three groupings of men who are perfectly capable of work, which means they can't legally get work, which means they're criminals or not here legally. These are jobs that would pay better with benefits if it was done right. We need better policies for immigration control, and we need better ways for people to come here legally. In my eyes that means we need a wall with guards, but we also need more agencies out there to speed up the process needed for those who should be here legally to do so.

As it turns out, another group you might generally expect to support the president is also less than thrilled with his order: namely, the military itself.  Responding to criticism of the dubious deployment last week, Defense Secretary James Mattis demurred: We dont do stunts in this department. The soldiers being sent to the border are there to provide support to the Department of Homeland Security, just as they often do after natural disasters, Mattis insisted. The secretary did not speak to the question of whether a dwindling caravan of around 3,000 Central American asylum seekers, currently 800 miles from the border and traveling on foot, really merited the same emergency response as a hurricane.  Since then, several reports have come out showing that Trumps original vision for the deployment, tendentiously titled Operation Faithful Patriot, was larger in scope than what the Pentagon ultimately allowed, as some of what the president expected the soldiers to do was at best wasteful and at worst illegal. The administrations first request, CNN reported on Friday, was for soldiers to provide crowd and traffic control and protect Customs and Border Protection personnel, which some Defense officials viewed as law enforcement activities the military is barred by law from performing. That request was rejected, as was a proposal that soldiers construct housing for detained migrants, according to Reuters.",no

A 2018 study published by the Cato Institute found that undocumented immigrants commit less crime than native-born citizens, and according to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) the majority of illegal drugs coming into the country across the southern border are being smuggled through legal points of entry.

"The statistic shows the number of mass shootings in the United States between 1982 and November 19, 2018, by race and ethnicity of the shooter(s). Between 1982 and November 2018, 60 out of 107 mass shootings were initiated by White shooters. The Las Vegas strip massacre in 2017 had the highest number of victims between 1982 and 2018, with 58 people killed, and over 500 injured. Additional information on mass shooter profiles in the United States  The high number of tragic mass shootings that have occurred in the United States has led to a large amount of attention on the profile of the people who commit such violent acts. A look at the worst mass shootings in the United States suggests no clear common connections other than a tendency to undertake mass shootings in educational institutions and other populated areas. However, a look at mass shootings in the United States by gender shows a great majority of mass shootings are carried out by men.  With no clear patterns between the socio-economic or cultural background of mass shooters increasing attention has been placed on mental health. Analysis of the factors Americans considered to be to blame for mass shootings showed 48 percent of people felt the inability of the mental health system to recognize those who pose a danger to others was a significant factor. Further attention has also been given to the factors influencing the behavior of mass shooters. Surveys on violence in the media and drug use as potential factors show that many Americans place blame on these influences.  In the wake of multiple mass shootings critics have sought to look beyond the issues of shooter identification and their influences by focusing on their access to guns. The study mentioned above showed 61 percent of Americans felt the easy access to firearms was to blame by either a great deal or a fair amount. Hide",14.5,Counterspeech,original post,yes

"Its a pity, Mr President. America is such a beautiful nation. A decade ago, I went to California to study. I should have fit right in, I spoke perfect English and Spanish, I was paying for my own schooling, and had a bright career ahead of myself being a hardworking person, and a Deans List student in a STEM field. Having gotten out of Venezuela while the getting was good, I felt I was in a land of opportunity and that with hard work, perseverance, and respect there was room for my dreams to come true in this environment. It had not been easy to secure a visa to go to America to study, and staying would not be easy either but my love of the country and its ideals made me determined to try. Life chose a different path for me. Upon finishing college, there was a full-blown economic crisis in the country. I left to Asia where young people like me could more easily find work based on special skills and secure a visa. Others in California suggested I could just stay illegally and eventually use loopholes to claim asylum and go on welfare  but I had too much respect for myself and for the country to do that.   I have spent many years in developed Asia now and I still cannot understand how this situation is still crippling the America I once knew and loved. Over here there is no welfarism, basically no handouts of any kind, and zero tolerance for immigration violations. The result is virtually no crime and very little of thr social ills now a mainstay in every American community: single-parent households, drug addiction, and degeneracy. Over here, there is a vibrant community of highly-skilled and entrepreneurial people from overseas who call cities here home but it not a mass phenomenon. We all have dreams, as do the native citizens here, but we all understand no one has a right to break the law to fulfil their dreams.   Americans, too, have dreams. The establishment politicians and the media have allowed emotional terrorism to dominate the debate on immigration and the rule of law in the United States. Only principles can be used to rein in emotions.

If this doesn't open your eyes, nothing will!  From the LA. Times:  1. 40% of all workers in LA County (10.2 million people) are working for cash; and not paying taxes. This is because they are predominantly illegal immigrants, working without a green card. (Donald Trump was right)  2. 95 %of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens.  3. 75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens.  4. Over 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers.  5. Nearly 35% of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals; they are here illegally.  6. Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages.  7. The FBI reports half of all gang members in Los Angeles are most likely illegal aliens from south of the border.  8 Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal.  9. 21 radio stations in LA are Spanish-speaking.  10. In LA County, 5.1 million people speak English; 3.9 million, speak Spanish. (There are 10.2 million people, in LA County.  (All 10 of the above facts were published in the Los Angeles Times)  Less than 2% of illegal aliens are picking our crops, but 29% are on welfare.  Over 70% of the United States' annual population growth, ( and over 90% of California, Florida, and New York), results from immigration.  Also, 29% of inmates in federal prisons are illegal aliens.

We never questioned our Government, we always believed that what they were doing was the right thing for the American people, when in-fact it wasn't.  I, myself was blinded by their lies and the media help hide those lies.  I never knew how much evil and hate was hidden in this world until you became President. It's a shame how people act, let alone can't see for themselves that we were, have and are being brainwashed to spill out this hate, and it's even more heart breaking that they can't see how the Democrats and certain Republicans can't be honest.  Their main goal is to one day take our rights away. It's even more heart breaking and sick when people agree to kill an innocent child.     Looking back over the years, I noticed that when someone is finally wanting to do good for the American people, they question you, they tear you down, they call you names, they call you a liar, etc., but when evil and lies exist, we say nothing. Insane!!!  Anyway, thank you for opening my eyes to the truth, thank you for being you, thank you for giving up so much when you didn't have to, thank you for standing strong, thanking you for all that you do.

"This was a jarring week as Trump declared a national emergency after Congress refused to fund his wall  perhaps his most brazen authoritarian act yet. Trumps predilection not to govern, but rather rule by an unprecedented executive fiat, set off alarm bells for Constitutional separation of powers, as Trump departed early Friday for a weekend of golf at Mar-a-Lago.  This week the Mueller probe made news as reporting indicated Trumps former campaign chair Paul Manafort discussed a peace plan for Ukraine and handed off internal polling data in a secretive meeting to a business associate with ties to Russian intelligence, and a search warrant revealed Roger Stone was in direct contact with WikiLeaks while interacting with the Trump campaign  both in the months before the 2016 election.  At a Trump campaign-style event in El Paso, a BBC cameraman was physically assaulted by a supporter  symbolic of Trumps continued attacks on the media and his stoking of hatred against marginalized communities. Trumps speech in El Paso and his declaring a manufactured emergency in Rose Garden were both a repetition of disproven lies and exaggerations, as Trump continues to propagate a dystopian alternate reality and act unilaterally.

It sucks that you can't find a job with the skills you have, maybe try learning Spanish or move to a place where speaking Spanish isn't a job requirement... If 45 knows things we don't that make it crisis now that is more important than helping the Americans in California or Puerto Rico then why did it take so long for him to declare an emergency? Why didn't he do so in the first 2 years of his term when he was trying to get this done? It's not an emergency if you wait 2 years... Jim Jenkins - if control laws take lives, that blanket statement would mean you having a driver's license, being married in the government's eyes, or opening a bank account take lives... there are many countries with stricter gun laws that have lower crime rates. That point on gun control laws was also just simple way of showing that if you support a wall because it could save one person's life, then you should also support guns laws as they would save one person's life, or healthcare for all as that saves one life, or a full transition to renewable energy as that saves one life... more wall is a waste of taxpayer funds if it doesn't deal with the majority issues used to manufacture its need as an emergency, namely illegal immigration and drug smuggling.  Lastly saying that relatively few innocent people are killed by a gun is just plain nonsense. Try telling that to one family members that was killed in any number of mass killings in the last few years from Sandy Hook to Las Vegas concert goers... and stricter gun control doesn't mean law abiding citizens cant own guns, it just means they have to jump through a few more hoops. You loved your wife enough to file paperwork with the government declaring it, why cant you do the same with your gun? You wanted to drive bad enough you took a test showing you knew how to do so safely and show back up at the dmv every few years to reregister your license, why wouldn't you also do the same to own gun?",17.333333333333332,Affiliation,Kanthar Balanathan check the history books.

"More trump Bullshit:    The Actual Facts about  'Murder and Extremism in the United States in 2018'  'ADL, EXECUTIVE SUMMARY'  'Each year, ADLs Center on Extremism (COE) tracks murders perpetrated by all types of extremists. The 2018 Murder & Extremism report provides key insights into the crimes, including motivations behind these violent attacks.  2018 was a particularly active year for right-wing extremist murders: Every single extremist killing  from Pittsburgh to Parkland  had a link to right-wing extremism. Among this reports key findings:  Every year adherents of a variety of extreme causes kill people in the United States; ADLs COE tracks these murders. In 2018, domestic extremists killed at least 50 people in the U.S., a sharp increase from the 37 extremist-related murders documented in 2017, though still lower than the totals for 2015 (70) and 2016 (72).  The 50 deaths make 2018 the fourth-deadliest year on record for domestic extremist-related killings since 1970.  The extremist-related murders in 2018 were overwhelmingly linked to right-wing extremists.  Every one of the perpetrators had ties to at least one right-wing extremist movement, although one had recently switched to supporting Islamist extremism. White supremacists were responsible for the great majority of the killings, which is typically the case.  Deadly shooting sprees were a major factor in the high death toll. Five of the 17 incidents involved shooting sprees that caused 38 deaths and injured 33 people.  The perpetrator of one of 2018s deadly shooting sprees, at a yoga studio in Tallahassee, was connected to the misogynistic incel/manosphere movement. In the wake of this attack and a similarly-motivated killing spree in Toronto, Canada, ADLs COE now tracks such incidents as extremist-related killings and has updated its database to include an earlier incel-linked incident, Elliot Rodgers 2014 shooting spree.  Firearms remain the weapon of choice for extremists who kill. Guns were responsible for 42 of the 50 deaths in 2018, followed by blades or edged weapons.'  https://www.adl.org/murder-and-extremism-2018",16.833333333333332,Not Counterspeech,original post,no

""" 'I didnt need to do this,' President Trump insisted at a Rose Garden appearance on Friday, as he declared a national emergency aimed at shaking loose a few billion dollars in financing for his beloved border wall.  ""The presidents assertion was both ludicrous and self-defeating. If a declaration was unnecessary and the wall on track (the wall is 'very very on its way,' the president said earlier in the week), how could he claim to be addressing an emergency? As Mr. Trump explained it, 'But Id rather do it much faster.' A presidential desire for speed does not constitute a crisis  no matter how eager a president is to camouflage his failures."" - NYT Editorial Board  ""This weeks bipartisan spending bill, which contained no more wall money than the one over which Mr. Trump shut down the government in December, was a particularly humiliating defeat.  ""Desperate to save face, the president and his team cooked up a nonemergency emergency with the aim of seizing funds already appropriated for other purposes. Currently, the plan is to pull $2.5 billion from the militarys drug interdiction program, $3.6 billion from its construction budget and $600 million from the Treasury Departments drug forfeiture fund. The White House plans to 'backfill' the money it is taking from the Pentagon in future budgets.  ""And so, in a breathtaking display of executive disregard for the separation of powers, the White House is thumbing its nose at Congress, the Constitution and the will of the American people, the majority of whom oppose a border wall.  ""Even as he spun this as an act of strong leadership, Mr. Trump acknowledged that his declaration resolves nothing and creates a host of legal, legislative and political troubles."" - NYT Editorial Board  https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/opinion/trump-border-wall-national-emergency.html",12,Positive tone,original post,yes

"For more than a century, innumerable studies have confirmed two simple yet powerful truths about the relationship between immigration and crime: immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes or be behind bars than the native-born, and high rates of immigration are associated with lower rates of violent crime and property crime. This holds true for both legal immigrants and the unauthorized, regardless of their country of origin or level of education. In other words, the overwhelming majority of immigrants are not criminals by any commonly accepted definition of the term. For this reason, harsh immigration policies are not effective in fighting crime. Unfortunately, immigration policy is frequently shaped more by fear and stereotype than by empirical evidence. As a result, immigrants have the stigma of criminality ascribed to them by an ever-evolving assortment of laws and immigration-enforcement mechanisms. Put differently, immigrants are being defined more and more as threats. Whole new classes of felonies have been created which apply only to immigrants, deportation has become a punishment for even minor offenses, and policies aimed at trying to end unauthorized immigration have been made more punitive rather than more rational and practical. In short, immigrants themselves are being criminalized.",19.333333333333332,Affiliation,original post,yes

As it turns out, another group you might generally expect to support the president is also less than thrilled with his order: namely, the military itself.  Responding to criticism of the dubious deployment last week, Defense Secretary James Mattis demurred: We dont do stunts in this department. The soldiers being sent to the border are there to provide support to the Department of Homeland Security, just as they often do after natural disasters, Mattis insisted. The secretary did not speak to the question of whether a dwindling caravan of around 3,000 Central American asylum seekers, currently 800 miles from the border and traveling on foot, really merited the same emergency response as a hurricane.  Since then, several reports have come out showing that Trumps original vision for the deployment, tendentiously titled Operation Faithful Patriot, was larger in scope than what the Pentagon ultimately allowed, as some of what the president expected the soldiers to do was at best wasteful and at worst illegal. The administrations first request, CNN reported on Friday, was for soldiers to provide crowd and traffic control and protect Customs and Border Protection personnel, which some Defense officials viewed as law enforcement activities the military is barred by law from performing. That request was rejected, as was a proposal that soldiers construct housing for detained migrants, according to Reuters.",no

But his marquee Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida is not signed up, nor are his golf courses in Virginia, Philadelphia or Bedminster, New Jersey  where, The New York Times reported Thursday, some illegal immigrants have been working for years. One of them, Victorina Morales, a Guatemalan woman who jumped the border in 1999, has been at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster for more than five years, making Mr. Trumps bed, cleaning his toilet and dusting his golf trophies, the newspaper reported.",20.666666666666668,Positive tone,original post,yes

Rutgers University called a few days later. The Shaw family already had reason to be proud. Jamiel's mother, Army Sgt. Anita Shaw, was on her second tour of duty in Iraq. On Sunday night, it was Jamiel's father on the phone and then his son's girlfriend, Chrystale Miles. Jamiel Sr. called to tell him to hurry home from the mall. The 17-year-old boy was three doors away when someone (Pedro Espinoza ) shot him to death while he was still talking on his cellphone to Chrystale,  Jamiel Sr. heard the shots almost as soon as he hung up. He ran out of the house, raced around the corner and found his son lying on the sidewalk, bleeding.""  ""Los Angeles police officials described the killing as random and senseless, cutting down a youth who had been doing everything right in his life -- from hitting the books to never missing church to inspiring the Los Angeles High Romans to last year's Southern League title. A police spokeswoman said two Latino men pulled up in a car, jumped out, asked Jamiel if he belonged to a gang, and shot him when he didn't answer. She said Jamiel was not affiliated with a gang"". ""The youth's football coach, Hardy Williams, was with the family Monday at their 5th Avenue home, where Jamiel's trophies and medals lined the mantel. His 9-year-old brother, Thomas, wore Jamiel's favorite Atlanta Braves cap. Tears flowed. ""He was a very special kid,"" Williams said. ""Not only was he an outstanding athlete, he was a good person. I've never seen Jamiel mad. He had such a big smile."" The coach described his standout player as ""a Houdini on the football field,"" and the numbers backed it up. As a junior, Jamiel rushed for more than 1,000 yards last year, averaging just over 14 yards per carry. An invitational All-City first-team selection, he scored 11 touchdowns, returned punts and kickoffs, and played defensive back. He also competed in track. Hours before he was shot, Jamiel had spent the day at a football camp at Pasadena City College, Williams said. ""Stanford just called me about his transcripts,"" he said. ""Rutgers called a couple of days ago. He was just on track. . . . He was very elated."" He is not elated anymore. He is dead. Rotting under six feet of dirt, Donald Trump is his only voice.

"White supremacist and other far-right extremist groups have killed 51 police officers since 1990, according to a report published by the Anti-Defamation League last week. Left-wing extremist groups, including black nationalists, killed 11 during the same period.  In 2017 alone, black nationalists and other leftists killed no police, while white supremacists and anti-government extremists fatally attacked a police officer and two corrections officers, the report said.  But while the FBI tracks so-called black identity extremists as domestic terror threats  as an FBI counterterrorism report completed in August and leaked in October revealed it doesnt have an equivalent designation for white extremists.  Experts worry that the broad labeling of black groups, and not white ones, is an indication that federal law enforcements targeting of certain groups is based less on evidence than on politics.  https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article196423174.html",12,Positive tone,original post,yes

"If President Trump only knew of this... murder... just down the road from the Winter White House...  Hoping to impress upon Governor Ron DeSantis that the FDLE and FBI should ""get on this"". Murderers walking free because of incompetent Officers and wealthy backers.   Executive Summary:  Palm Beach County family seeks redress, fair justice, and relief after being denied U.S. and State of Florida Constitutional rights under color of law related to and concerning the homicide of NIA LEE ANKNER.  Specifically, in the face of overwhelming relevant, material, and competent evidence, to date all State and Local Authorities have refused to initiate a criminal investigation into and regarding the opiate caused death of NIA LEE ANKNER. Although the surviving family has provided competent and substantial evidence of a homicide; there has been no related criminal investigation initiated nor conducted by any authorized Florida law enforcement entity, being wholly contrary to and violative of Art. I,  2, and Art. I,  16(b) Fla. Const. (1998), and  839.13,  839.20,  843.0855, and  843.14, Fla. Stat.  Due to incompetence of Town of Palm Beach investigating Law Enforcement Officers at the crime scene, and the subsequent and continuing obstruction of justice by supervising Town of Palm Beach Officers; the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, (FDLE), Palm Beach Sheriff's Office (PBSO), Town of Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD), Florida State Attorneys Office 15th Judicial District (15th SAO), and the Palm Beach County Medical Examiners Office (PBME) have all refused to conduct a homicide investigation, as required by Law.  NIA LEE ANKNERs surviving family has information and evidence providing probable cause to charge and arrest one KELLY ANNE MCCAULEY for 1st Degree Capital Murder.   In August of 2017, KELLY ANNE MCCAULEY and other persons yet unknown, in the County of Palm Beach, and against the statute, peace, and dignity of the State of Florida, did unlawfully from a premeditated design to effect the death of a human being, and caused the death of a human being, NIA LEE ANKNER, through the unlawful distribution of opium or any compound, derivative or preparation of opium and/or fentanyl, opium or any compound, derivative or perpetration of opium, and/or fentanyl, and which was the proximate cause of the death of NIA LEE ANKNER , did kill and murder, NIA LEE ANKNER, contrary to Florida Statue 782.04(1)(a)1, 782.04(1)(a)2, and 782.04(1)(a)3. (CAPITAL FELONY).  ""Dear Governor Ron DeSantis,  I and my family pray you are well and happy; and, we thank God you are Floridas 46th Chief Executive.  My name is Charles E. Ankner. I (and my family) seek your Offices review of the information herein related to the homicide of my biological niece, Nia Lee Ankner (Decedent); with an end goal of a competent homicide investigation being performed by an authorized Florida criminal investigative entity outside of Palm Beach County.  With your being a former U.S. Navy JAG Officer, and my being a USAF Veteran and certified long experienced paralegal; Ill strive to be accurate and brief in my presentation, and yet be comprehensive.  Quite frankly Governor, we pray the information herein will make your blood boil; and, motivate you to action.  In August of 2017, the Decedent had met a former coworker-acquaintance, one Kelly Anne McCauley, for a Saturday afternoon pool swim at another persons residence near the Town of Palm Beach. Neither made it to the pool; and the Decedent was brain-dead from an opiate overdose within two-hours of meeting that day with McCauley. McCauley also delayed calling 911 for twenty-minutes while instead calling her newly estranged boyfriend. By the time McCauley did call 911, eighty-percent of the Decedents brain was dead.   Admittedly, the Decedent also had a blood alcohol level of 0.15 in her system at the time of her brain-death. The combination of an opiate supplied by McCauley and ethanol caused the Decedent to stop breathing in the presence of McCauley while she purposefully delayed summoning help. In fact, besides after a twenty-minute in calling 911; McCauley did nothing to render help to the Decedent (rescue-breathing, flag down other cars for help, going into the Office of the Condo parking lot where they were at). McCauley, beyond a reasonable doubt, after supplying a fatal illicit opiate to the Decedent actually and proximately caused her death; and McCauley also for twenty minutes stood-by and let the Decedent suffocate to death.   Kelly McCauley has a long criminal record in Palm Beach County, including for but not limited to: illicit controlled substance use and possession, illicit drug paraphernalia use and possession, solicitation of prostitution, felony armed robbery, felony battery, felony grand theft, and destroying, tampering with, and concealing evidence. In my review of her criminal record; McCauley has always pled-out and never served more than a few months in the Palm Beach County Jail.  Tragically, McCauley is an all too common Palm Beach County catch and release felon. Even more tragic; McCauley was arrested only four-months before murdering the Decedent by Palm Beach County Florida Highway Patrol, for illegal possession of Xanax; with the driver of the car she was in unconscious and the car against the center barrier of Interstate-95. McCauley has lost her driving privileges due to several DUIs.  The Decedent had no criminal nor arrest record.  The motivation for PBPD Officers to resist, soft-peddle, or obstruct any and all related criminal investigations is that instead of concentrating on McCauley related to the Decedents condition and ultimate death; the PBPD exclusively concentrated on collecting evidence against the Decedent for DUI. In other words, PBPD Detective Lawrence Mennetti and Sgt. Scott Duquette screwed the pooch by not processing the scene and detaining McCauley pursuant to Florida Statute. Thereafter, Detective Mennetti performed what believe to be a half-stepped sham investigation in the incident and concluded no crime was committed in our jurisdiction..  Just a draft.

Charles Landry this is not proof of need for a wall.

"President Trump will have the law on his side when he uses the power of his office to secure the U.S. border with Mexico.  Fortunately, both the Constitution and the Congress have placed the authority to do so firmly with the President of the United State.   Executive action may be taken where Congresss intention is unclear, and actions like the one President Trump may be preparing to take now, where Congress has already delegated the authority to act. Since Congress has already delegated the authority to act, and with funding, this is where presidential power is at its zenith, carrying almost the full undivided executive power of the U.S. government.  When the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate. In these circumstances, and in these only, may he be said to personify the federal sovereignty. If his act is held unconstitutional under these circumstances, it usually means that the Federal Government, as an undivided whole, lacks power.  The main unresolved question is simply how the President can use existing appropriations to carry out those responsibilities without new, specific bequests from Congress beyond the $1.375 billion in this latest bill.  The method is a declaration of a national emergency.  The 2006 Secure Fence Act, for example, commands the executive branch to take all actions...necessary and appropriate to achieve and maintain operational control over the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States, specifically including physical barriers. This is beyond mere implied intent of congress    Then there is the The Immigration and Nationality Act which grants the President the authority to suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.This again implies the intent of congress.  So even without the most recent Bill passed allowing funding for border physical barriers, the previous Acts already gave the executive branch clear authority to take action on border security and barriers.   Congress can not micro manage how the POTUS and his staff carries out their duties. Thats why the executive branch is seperate. Otherwise we would just let Pelosi run the country.  In this case, the emergency powers Congress has already delegated to the President are perfectly tailored to allow him to solve the border crisis. A declaration of national emergency authorizes the President, without regard to any other provision of law, to tap into funds already appropriated for military construction and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers civil works program.  Until Congress passes a new law or resolution  which would require a two-thirds majority in both houses if President Trump were to issue a veto  the legislative branch has already given the President ample authority to declare a state of emergency on the southern border and take action.",12.666666666666666,Not Counterspeech,original post,no

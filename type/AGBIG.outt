Facts/Logic How sad. Bless you.
Negative Tragically they don't seem to care one bit.
Negative I was working for an employer who had hired illegal immigrants and didn't notify the staff that had been working there. One of the younger a_ _ holes invited me out to his place for a beverage, the boss's son even said he'd be there so I thought nothing of it (we both were young and he wasn't bad looking) so I kindly accepted the offer (2nd mistake) 1st was even talking to him in the 1st place. We planned a time and he gave me the address, now keep in mind I was currently residing in a smaller town where at this younger age it didn't seem to be an issue to go to someone's place.  Upon arriving I had to go through a cattle gate, house was out in the country, upon arriving to the house, there were more guys out there than I had originally thought there would be. I then decided that MAYBE this just wasn't a good idea and I was trying to leave in my car, never had gotten outside of it. I found out that there were a couple of men outside and they had chain locked the gate closed and I NOT wanting to destruct property, demanded they open the gate. No one would open the gate, one other guy had made his way into my car and forced me over and drove me back to the house where there were 7 maybe 8 illegal immigrants and a 50+ yr old Male who MIGHT have been a U.S. resident. They dragged me into the home where they forced themselves on me, forced liquor down my throat and then proceeded to take me into a bedroom where I continued to fight them off of me, one by one they all took turns, they all were all over me and it then became a group thing, I fought and fought what seemed like hours, once everyone had their fun, I managed to crawl myself into the bathroom, near the bedroom I was in and in there the 50 yr old man put me into the shower, by know the liquor had kicked in and I was pretty much a lump on a log. So I was finished off in a shower with this horrible 50+ yr old and left alone once all were done having there fun. I yelled and screamed I kicked and clawed I threw punches I even tried to bite, by the time I came too I was naked in a cold shower and even though I was still pretty well lit, I was able to get just enough on to get myself out of the house and my keys and get in my car where I was able to then escape any future sexual assaults. I wasn't even sure if I was going to be held longer or released. I tried to file charges, but after that night all men were on the run including the older man himself. So nothing had ever come of it other than me getting counseling. BELIEVE WE HAVE TO BUILD THIS WALL TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN.  I would NEVER wish a gang bang on even my worst enemy. I have gone through counseling and I have over come my situation. I have a daughter now, and I fear that she NEVER EVER endures such a HORRIBLE HORROR.  This happened about 12 years ago, but it has only gotten worse  since then with the population of illegals.  Let's protect our future!
Positive Yeah a wall doesn't fix tunnels or airplanes must I keep going ?

Negative IDIOT! You don't have the house votes or even a legit cause to unseat her never mind impeach her.
Positive If the wall saves 1 life it will have paid for itself.
Affiliation WHAT ABOUT THE ONE THAT ARE HERE ?
Positive Ah, stupid? trump is guilty of sedition; Pelosi is guilty of representing the majority of Americans in opposing the wall.
Affiliation Laws against drunk driving are already in place and are enforced.  Immigration laws have become relaxed and people try to protect those who come here illegally.  Big difference in how the 2 are addressed.  Did my friend deserve to die when he was walking down the sidewalk and was struck by a female illegal immigrant and thrown 50 feet through the air and spending the next 2 weeks in the hospital before he died. The driver was sober and had no insurance and because of her status as an illegal the state's DA decided not to press charges she lives a happy life in Rockford illinois while an American family weeps.  So how will you defend something like this.  Even more so when the person that killed my friend had no legal right to even be in the country that my friend fought and served for.
Negative Idiot
Negative Sure it is. Look at the correlation of violent crimes and stricter gun laws in the US.  Then look at how many people overdose. After that, how many people die from the effects of smoking? And, how many innocent bystanders are killed as a result from driving under the influence?

Negative Thank you President Trump for fighting for us. Trump 2020
Facts/Logic Trump is staying relevant as the wall is the only issue he has to stand on.  Unfortunately people are biting on this.  Child poverty, inequality, high infant death rates, gun crime, corporate greed...These are the burning issues that Trump can neither fix nor wants to address.  Building a wall is easy.
Positive Sorry for all the loss of lives to our people.  The illegals shouldnt have even been here....  we are just learning how corrupt many of our Congressmen/women and senators are...much of this death and dying is their fault for not upholding the laws of our land already in place..

Humor Nancy J. Seddon liberals lack common sense. Heck now they have several that support killing full term babies and have anti-semites in their ranks.
Positive I won't deny the fact that America has a gun problem, though we can't act like illegal immigration isn't an issue.  While not every immigrant is a threat to society, we cannot deny the fact some of them are, even if they're a minority. Some are even wanted criminals.  Not to mention that if Orange-man were to actually implement stricter firearm control, there would still be a lot of contraband crossing the border because of the lack of immigration control. Not just drugs, but unlicensed weapons as well.  They're basically fuel for the black market which puts unlicensed weapons in the wrong hands. this in itself is valid reason to encourage possession of a firearm to protect one's self against this threat.  I think that fixing (or at least minimizing) the contraband problem is the first step towards implementing a better, more efficient gun control project since the population will feel more secure.  Whether building a wall is the best solution is up for debate. On the surface it looks extreme, but we won't know its efficiency until it's finalized. Until then, people will have a valid argument to defend both the second amendment and the wall. Pierre-Luc Vachon
Facts/Logic What about all those non illegals that murder like yesterdays shooting...how is a wall going to protect us. National emergency si gun control not trumps promised wall.

Affiliation M......f......ers!
Affiliation Apple Rivera if this story is even true, which I doubt, because Enterprise would have told you that whoever they rented that truck to is responsible for any loss or damage incurred by that truck.

Border patrol gets sniped at quite often and sometimes killed. Is this what we all really want? If you dont want the wall go down there and see for yourself what it's like. You ever heard of the creative use of a chainsaw to cut a live human apart? You tube it. They arent all bad but which ones are? You willing to take that chance? I sure as hell am not.

Facts/Logic SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS  VILE VICIOUS VINDICTIVE EVIL demonRATS  ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HER DEATH LET US NOW DESTROY THEM
Warning Curtis Rice your a jerk
Facts/Logic We were hit from behind while on the way to work. The driver of the other car, an older white woman, pulled up beside us and shouted that she was going to pull off to the side of the road. Then she turned off her lights so we couldn't see her license plate, and drove off. Our car was destroyed, and I required medical attention, and she just left us there. Another time an older white woman wrecked our car, and hers, by making a left turn from the right lane without looking. She then, unsuccessfully, tried to convince the police it was our fault. Another older white woman backed into my car in a parkinglot, denting in the front and breaking my headlight. Despite doing this in front of a police officer, she hit the gas and sped off. When they caught her we discovered she didn't have insurance. Once, when driving a work truck on the interstate, an older white man became enraged because I wasn't driving fast enough in the fast lane. I had to be in that lane because my exit was coming up off of it, and I had to slow down to 60 because my truck wouldn't have made the turn otherwise. He sped up, cut in front of me, and slammed on his breaks. Somehow I managed to stop in time. If my truck hadn't been empty, I would have certainly hit him, and we both could have been killed. I have never had an unpleasant encounter of any kind with an immigrant, legal or otherwise. Middle-aged white people are another story.

I probably don't understand the issues you face because #1 I'm straight and #2 a person's life choices, sexuality, political affiliation, skin color, etc aren't really things I think about when I meet someone or pass them on the street.  My first impression of people is usually based on whether they are polite and pleasant or have a chip on their shoulder and a crappy attitude.  Other than that, I personally don't go throughout my daily life in fear of much.  I do believe that illegal immigration is a problem in the United States.

Positive Edgar D. GutierrezTexas is the only state to track crime specifically among illegal immigrants let's use them as an example:  Between January 2011- January 2019 there have been 10 school shootings in the state of Texas.

"Between June 1, 2011 and January 31, 2019, 189,000 illegal aliens were charged with more than 295,000 criminal offenses. DPS criminal history records reflect those criminal charges have thus far resulted in over 120,000 convictions including 238 HOMICIDE convictions; 13,662 assault convictions; 3,158 burglary convictions; 17,930 drug convictions; 175 kidnapping convictions; 7,100 theft convictions; 11,336 obstructing police convictions; 1,013 robbery convictions; 1,710 sexual assault convictions; 1,153 sexual offense convictions; and 1,282 weapon convictions."

Im guessing most of them dont walk over the border but are not caught by the checks in place. Even if they walk over the border why arent they rounded up and sent back? Is it possible that there is corruption here, why are they so easily avoiding detection? A wall wont fix issues like these, get to the core of the issue, seems like a bandaid wall wont fix this.
Positive Legal immigration is also destroying this country as most people just overstay. Shut it all down
Positive BUILD THE WALL....lets get started...
Negative if my taxes go to building a wall it better be a wall around you and your supporters. there are plenty other things that need to be fixed over and before a wall and yet you ignore them congrats you don't care about america (mexico is america btw also canada as well you are thinking of the united states families not american families) you care about yourself

Facts/Logic WAR IS WONDERFUL WITH JESUS ON OUR SIDE! U.S. State Department approves $12 billion in military sales to Qatar, $8.2bn to Saudi Arabia, $50b to Israel and $1.4bn to Taiwan. America is the world's #1 arms dealer and has a military budget of $600 bn to Russia's $70bn!
Affiliation Wendi DelValle Im so sorry for your loss. Lets hope this wall gets built. Maybe it should be engraved with the names of all the lives that have been lost because we didnt have it.
Affiliation Angela K Christensen You cant have national security without border security. Its not only necessary for any meaningful immigration reform; border security plays a crucial role in both the interdiction of illegal drugs and in defending America against criminal threats. Weak borders allow criminal and smugglers, as well as millions of illegal aliens, to have virtually free entrance to the United States.  If this was not true then why are there some 20 million ILLEGAL aliens living in the United States now, and why is there a drug epidemic killing thousands of Americans every year, and why are Americans being robbed and murdered by Illegal aliens.  Contrary to news reports the majority of these drugs are traceable to drug cartels in Mexico, not from pharmaceutical companies.

Positive While living in Chandler AZ...I was viciously raped by an illegal immigrant @ knifepoint in my own house after he broke in.
Negative None of those are good arguments however our underprotected border is a good argument and for all the reasons you just listed along with many others. Our gov is starting to deal with American problems yet we fight them....should be excited that we are trying to do something for America.and encourage it so that it may continue.

Facts/Logic I don't feed into propaganda I have seen first hand. Walls do work they are built all the time for the purpose of stopping things.  if the wall is in place then we can focus towards what comes in through ports without the worry of it crossing over the border unprotected. I challenge u to take down one wall from the outside of your home apartment etc and you will see that walls work and that just because you don't see what can go in or out doesn't mean that it doesn't.

He invested how many billions into green companies?  Almost everyone of them was bankrupt within six months.     Obama had unemployment going down yet at the same time so was job market participation rate, it hit a 40 year low.  People were not finding jobs, they were just getting taken off the roles.   Obama lowered taxes?  The Supreme Court ruled that the ACA was a tax, this giving Obama the largest tax increase in the history of the US.

Only if you were real president and thought about the American people and didnt only think about yourself.
Negative I'm so sorry. I pray you will somehow be able to survive all the heartbreaking dynamics of  this absolutely horrible loss of your precious son.

Facts/Logic Sincerest prayers sent to the family of this lost woman, but using this story as justification for the wall is down right dumb.  Anyone could have been behind the wheel of that car, it doesnt matter who it was. There are drunk drivers all across America, so are we just gonna build walls around their houses to keep them off our roads too? This sounds a lot like a lot of arguments against vaccinations I hear too. Saying well so and so died and she had shots therefore vaccines are bad for you is very comparable. This woman could have been struck with or without the wall, it just so happens to be that the man was an illegal immigrant, and therefore people are using it.  Honestly, the logic behind a lot of such issues amazes me, not just the wall.
Facts/Logic BINARY OPTIONS ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT.. Binary options trade has been developing rapidly over the last few years, This innovative approach to global markets allows people to quickly invest and extract profit from their investments without actually buying the asset that interests them. It is the price of these assets that is the focus of attention when dealing with binary options and the only thing people have to do is predict whether it will rise or fall in a certain period of time (Up or down). these are the only two things traders have to worry about, It was never so easy to become a successful trader all you need for success in binary options trading is a well approved broker to invest your money and get back profit in a week time. Your broker plays this role and point you in the right direction from the beginning of trade right up to the cashout of your profit. With a minimum investment of $300 you can make good profit of $3500 and $500 will earn you a profit of $5500 after a trading week.  If you're a newbie or a trader who has been loosing a lot of money recently you can contact me for more info on how you can go about the trading process.

Warning John Gardner California  LARGEST INSANE ASYLUM IN THE WORLD  Interesting that the LA Times did this. All the others are staying away from it. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, this should be of great interest to you!  Just One State - be sure and read the last part...  try for 3 times.  This is only one State... If this doesn't open your eyes, nothing will!  From the LA. Times:  1. 40% of all workers in LA County (10.2 million people) are working for cash; and not paying taxes. This is because they are predominantly illegal immigrants, working without a green card. (Donald Trump was right)  2. 95 %of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens.  3. 75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens.  4. Over 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers.  5. Nearly 35% of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals; they are here illegally.  6. Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages.  7. The FBI reports half of all gang members in Los Angeles are most likely illegal aliens from south of the border.  8 Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal.  9. 21 radio stations in LA are Spanish-speaking.  10. In LA County, 5.1 million people speak English; 3.9 million, speak Spanish. (There are 10.2 million people, in LA County.  (All 10 of the above facts were published in the Los Angeles Times)  Less than 2% of illegal aliens are picking our crops, but 29% are on welfare.  Over 70% of the United States' annual population growth, ( and over 90% of California, Florida, and New York), results from immigration.  Also, 29% of inmates in federal prisons are illegal aliens.  We are fools for letting this continue.  HOW CAN YOU HELP?  Send copies of this letter, to at least two other people.  To 100, would be even better.

Positive I live in Southern California a little west of Palm Springs and I say any City or State that becomes a Sanctuary City or Sanctuary State, thereby not enforcing Immigration Law, now can NOT enforce ANY Law. No one can be arrested for rape, robbery, assault, murder, etc., because that would be picking and choosing which Laws to enforce and which Laws to not enforce. The Employers who hire illegals, the Judges, Congressmen, Prosecutors, Mayors, Governors, and Church-Sanctuary People of those cities and states should be held accountable and arrested as accomplices for aiding and abetting illegals, and endangering the lives of United States Citizens.

Negative When I ask my self this question. About the wall. And weight out all the pros and cons. I came up with this.  I had a daughter. That was involved in. Human trafficking. She did not even know she was doing it. Because of the drugs and the influence. It had on her. She call us. And wanted to come home for a few days. I knew she was a prostitute. And it was hard to just think that some day Im going to get a phone call. From the police. Saying your daughter is dead. In my heart. Was a broken heart. To think what she was doing. She was MIA. Then out of the blue she called. I asked her questions. How are you. When are you going to come home. She would not say nothing. Out of shame. I would begin to cry. She would say dad dont cry. This is my choice. So I asked her this. What are you doing right now.  She told me. She was at the bus stop. To pick up some girls. From New York. I asked why. Because her pimp wanted her to. I told her. That is human trafficking. She said whats that. And I told her. What human trafficking is. And what happens to girls. She took the girls to a safe house. And she had to stay with them until the pimps. Muscle guys. Came and took him away. She told me they were 12 to 15-year-olds. She never saw those girls again after that night when the muscleman came and took them.  If a wall just stops one of these acts and prevent someone from getting killed from drugs to me its worth having the wall. If they cant come to America legally then they should not come at all does it read those their grandparents or someone they know that wanted to come to America had to either come here legally or illegally. Lives matters. And walls will save lives.

Positive For those who think there's no problem at the border...lend me your ear for a first hand story we heard today.  My son's  truck was stolen in San Antonio. Two weeks later they found it in Larado.  The sheriff said the seats are missing.  They take them out to fit more people to bring them across the border. They like the 4 wheel drives so they can drive through the ranches.  He said they get 200 stolen cars a day like this. Not 2 but 200!!! Multiply that by as many as they can stuff in the truck without any seats. Now multiply that by 365 days in a year.  Now tell me there's  no problem at the border and I will tell you you're crazy.

Positive 5 private citizens were killed at work in Aurora, Illinois on Friday. 5 police officers were injured while subduing the gunman, who was also killed.  The gunman was an employee who was being terminated.  His Illinois gun permit was pulled because he had a conviction in Mississippi, and the gun he purchased under that permit should have been confiscated.  This is a national emergency.  Five families in one day, lost a son, husband, father, brother, etc., killed by an American citizen who should not have had a gun.  39,000 people were killed by guns in our country last year.  That is a national emergency.
Positive Democrats only care about illegals.

Affiliation I hope the wall prevent missiles to come in too. Trump with all his BS is making the US look stupid and weak. He needs to really focus on how to make the country more powerful, not spending all of our money on dumb stuff.  Some of our allies are turning on us. Lately key allies like Turkey and India. He is just flexing and hoping to intimidate, that does not work anymore. He needs to act smarter.
Negative We need more posts like this.  News only reports about not wanting the wall. Never about the American people wanting it. That's why trump was voted in.  I am sure if it was one of those loud mouth reporters on television that lost a loved one they would be singing a different tune.   Or the Democrats in office.  I was a Democrat,switched over to Republican when trump was  running.

Affiliation Angela K Christensen.   Anybody who raises their hand would be foolish. We all know they came in by plane. A better question is raise your hand if you think the current wall is the reason all the Fentanyl was confiscated 2 weeks ago. Enough to kill 57000 people. That is the better question. Obviously those drugs wouldn't be coming into a port of entry if there was no wall. They would have come over in backpacks at points of the border where there isn't enough security.
Positive It is so sad that a leader would use the personal tragedies of a relatively small number of Americans to stoke fear in lots of Americans.  Perfection, in anything, cannot be obtained and sustained. We humans simply are not capable of perfection.

Positive Trump lacks certain qualities which are appreciated by good and decent people. He has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace.  He is a bully.  That is, except when he is among bullies like Putin; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling boot licker instead. The rules of basic decency cannot be found in Trump. He punches downwards  which a gentleman should, would, could never do  and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless  and he kicks them when they are down. The fact that a third of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think Yeah, he seems like my kind of guy is a matter of confusion and distress to people worldwide. There have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid. As reported in Japanese newspapers, Trump specifically asked Japanese PM Abe to nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize.    Twice before he submitted forged nominations on his own behalf because he is so desperately jealous of Obama.    How embarassingly sad is that?   Trump will never ever get a Nobel Peace Prize because he creates chaos and strife every single day....the opposite of peace.

Positive Curtis Rice lol - these comments are great. No one can even pull a BreitBart article above crime based on demographic.
Positive Erin Salgado seriously? Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher.
Positive I mourn your loss. However, declaring a national crisis and putting up a concrete wall will never solve America's immigration issues. Ronald Reagan once said  "Mr. Gorbachev, Tear Down This Wall. Bottom line, this is pure politics. It's all about satisfying his extreme right wing tea party base. Let the experts decide how best to solve our border issues. America is a democracy, not a dictatorship. The president continues to make up things and lie to the American people.
Affiliation So when are we building the walls around our schools? And movie theaters? And workplaces? And concert venues (need a roof for that one, too)? And when are we putting all of the white males who have killed SO many more than immigrants in this country in kennels? I'm not belittling the loss of even one child, it's tragic and heartbreaking, but declaring a "state of emergency" over a few bad people who also happen to be immigrants does not make sense when we have mass killings on THIS side of the border.  A wall wouldn't stop most of they illegal immigration, we know that most come through other routes, and therefore it's false logic to assume it would have saved any of the lives he is exploiting. Do take the money allotted to beef up where they DO come through, and spend money fighting mass shootings of Americans BY Americans.

Positive Dear Mr. President Trump, At first, I was a bit skeptical about having a business man run for president when I believed you had little knowledge of politics. Then you began to open my eyes to the corruption that as been in the White House for far too long. Like all business men, your main concern is to protect the company which he has invested into (that being the people of the USA). If walls don't work, then why do we fence in our backyards? (To protect our children from the known dangers of the outside world.) Why do we fence in cattle when it seems inhumane to force an animal to a restricted area? (To protect the investment of their owners and others from harm). Why do we fence in our public schools? (To protect innocent children from savage people who wish unnecessary violence against the future of America). Why do we build retaining walls around our house? (To stop mother nature from destroying our shelter, our home). Why do we build walls around freeways and areas of high traffic? (To protect each other from the negligence of other drivers and to protect our people from hit and runs). Why do we build railings on our bridges? (To protect people from the dangers of failing far far below). Your interest is direct and logical. Let's protect the American people from the dangers of our Southern boarder before the danger/crime/violence happens (Still a little late because there are many of Americans who have lost love ones due to not having a wall). Democrats are doing everything in their power to stop you, don't let them! They are after the votes of the illegals, not the protection of their citizens! You sir will most likely be the greatest president in my lifetime. Opening America's eyes one day at a time. Wake up or fall victim to the violence and destruction the Democratic party wants. Keep fighting for the American people, it's been a honor to have you for a president sir!!! #TRUMP2020

Nobodys done the job that weve done on the border,  said Donny as he declares a national emergency today........the slowest emergency in history.  And with the lawsuits that will ensue, his wall will not be funded or built until after the next election...if ever.  THE WORLDS SLOWEST EMERGENCY!!!!!  Donny lied directly to Americans about his border crisis.  Our Liar-in-Chief said that all the data that refutes his crisis designation is lies.  Got that?  Our president told the American people that THE FACTS ARE LIES...this is what all wannabe dictators say.  This egomaniac is THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!  Donny doesnt seem terribly concerned about this crisis.  He plans to travel to Florida mere hours after declaring the emergency from the White House. A president, in times of strife, would typically stay in the nations capital to oversee the crisis. Donny plans to do so from the comfort of his weekend getaway.  In reality, Donny is preparing the country for a fake war as he plans to enjoy a mini vacation. The only national emergency in America right now is one of leadership!!

However, Trump decides to play the emotion card and he's called a liar and every other name in the book. He's playing the game they invented. What poor sports.

Facts/Logic Here is a little morning history for you. Very interesting...  Thomas Jefferson His portrait is on the $2.00 Dollar Bill. This is amazing. There are two parts to this. Be sure to read the 2nd part.  Thomas Jefferson was a very remarkable man who started learning very early in life and never stopped. At 5, began studying under his cousin ' s tutor. At 9, studied Latin, Greek and French. At 14, studied classical literature and additional languages At 16, entered the College of William and Mary. Also could write in Greek with one hand, while writing the same in Latin with the other. At 19, studied Law for 5 years starting under George Wythe. At 23, started his own law practice. At 25, was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses. At 31, wrote the widely circulated "Summary View of the Rights of British America," and retired from his law practice. At 32, was a delegate to the Second Continental Congress. At 33, wrote the Declaration of Independence. At 33, took three years to revise Virginia ' s legal code and wrote a Public Education bill and a statute for Religious Freedom. At 36, was elected the second Governor of Virginia, succeeding Patrick Henry. At 40, served in Congress for two years. At 41, was the American minister to France and negotiated commercial treaties with European nations along with Ben Franklin and John Adams. At 46, served as the first Secretary of State under George Washington. At 53, served as Vice President and was elected President of the American Philosophical Society. At 55, drafted the Kentucky Resolutions and became the active head of the Republican Party. At 57, was elected the third president of the United States  At 60, obtained the Louisiana Purchase , doubling the nation ' s size. At 61, was elected to a second term as President. At 65, retired to Monticello. At 80, helped President Monroe shape the Monroe Doctrine. At 81, almost single-handedly, created the University of Virginia and served as its ' first president. At 83, died on the 50th Anniversary of the Signing of the Declaration of Independence, along with John Adams.  Thomas Jefferson knew because he himself studied, the previous failed attempts at government. He understood actual history, the nature of God, His laws and the nature of man. That happens to be way more than what most understand today.  Jefferson really knew his stuff.  A voice from the past to lead us in the future:  John F. Kennedy held a dinner in the White House for a group of the brightest minds in the nation at that time. He made this statement: "This is perhaps the assembly of the most intelligence ever to gather at one time in the White House, with the exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone."  "When we get piled upon one another in large cities, as in Europe, we shall become as corrupt as Europe ." -- Thomas Jefferson  "The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not." -- Thomas Jefferson  "It is incumbent on every generation to pay its ' own debts as it goes. A principle which if acted on, would save one-half the wars of the world." -- Thomas Jefferson  "I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people, under the pretense of taking care of them." -- Thomas Jefferson  "My reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government." -- Thomas Jefferson  "No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms." -- Thomas Jefferson  "The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government." -- Thomas Jefferson  "The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants." -- Thomas Jefferson  "To compel a man to subsidize with his taxes, the propagation of ideas which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical." -- Thomas Jefferson

Affiliation An emergency declaration ought to be reserved for legitimate emergency situations where quick, decisive action is needed to resolve a crisis.  Trump's failure to win approval for his vanity project does not constitute a national emergency.  Typically, when someone is facing a legitimate emergency, they wouldn't undermine their own argument for exercising emergency powers by admitting that the situation is such that they don't actually need to declare an emergency.  Trump is truly such a special case, that he deftly made the case for his "emergency" declaration by admitting, "I could do the wall over a longer period of time, I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster. And I don't have to do it for the election; I've already done a lot of wall for the election 2020."  Later in the same address, Trump basically admitted that his emergency declaration will not result in his Wall being built quickly.  If we are genuinely experiencing a border crisis that requires an emergency declaration from Trump, how is it that Trump was able to wait until nearly 25 months into his administration before declaring an emergency?  If the situation is so dire, and requires prompt, decisive action, exactly how will construction of a wall that would take several years to complete address the issue in time?   Sever dehydration is a medical emergency. Would you advise someone suffering from severe dehydration to begin development of a well to deal with their thirst, or would you give them a glass of water?  How do you justify building Trump's Wall to deter border crossings, when apprehensions at the southern border are near a 46 year low?  What good will Trump's Wall do to curb drug smuggling across the border, when both the DEA and the CBP admit that most of the narcotics that cross the southern border come through legal ports of entry?  How effective will Trump's Wall be at preventing undocumented immigrants from entering the country, when the Center for Migration Studies of New York found that in 2016-2017, 62% of the newly undocumented were folks who had overstayed their visas, and not crossed our southern border illegally?   How would Trump's Wall address the refugee crisis, when it won't provide any of the resources needed to process and adjudicate asylum claims, nor will it lead to a resolution of the circumstances refugees are fleeing in their homelands?  "Build the Wall!" was never a real solution. It was a slogan.  Trump'a Wall has always been a simplistic remedy offered by an ignorant sleaze in order to appeal to the simple-minded.

(Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR

Facts/Logic So should we just build a wall around the whole country so no one can get in or out? The south border is not the only border. Also, how many criminals from America have traveled across the southern border to live there illegally? It goes both ways. 911 happened because of a man across seas, complete opposite direction. Should I also mention that this land was taken from Indians, not given to our ancestors? There is so much to this that no one is considering because Trump's phony speeches and false promises are trapping you guys into this crap. Our country has been built on white, biblical, supremecy, and anyone who doesn't go by the book or anyone who belongs to a culture they don't like, they are trying to keep them out.

I cant figure that out. People need to set aside their feelings about President Trump & Congress & strip the debate down to what the issue is. This is keeping America safe, plain & simple. I really dont care if its a wall, border agents, cameras, whatever.  Put the bickering aside & just DO SOMETHING! We protect our homes, our possessions; why not our country? This is where we LIVE people! Such stupidity all this whining & name-calling. What good does that do? Put that energy towards something positive.

No, I didn't say fixed or a work around or even kind of repealed. I want it Repealed. And NO(!) repealing the "mandate" is NOT the same thing as a repeal. And no, he didn't promise to FIX Obamacare.

Affiliation Those who kill on the previous massacres around the country are not illegal immigrants
Affiliation It's funny how Florida's response to a mass shooting was more guns.. why, because people in the state of mind want to make an impact, they have a sick desire to be heard. If they get stopped before they make their statement, there's less motivation

Affiliation Christopher Thompson , each and every immigrant costs the taxpayers in excess of $50,000 a year. These are figures given by the Budget Accounting Office. Free medical, schooling, and now college yet those things arent offered to US citizens....
Facts/Logic The president was right to declare our border crisis a national emergency. While the vast majority of illegal immigrants are not violent criminals, they have all violated the laws which are in place to keep the American people safe. Good editorial. Heartbreaking story. Im glad Trump is finally making good on his promise to enforce our laws.
Negative Congrat!
Positive And your plans to keep American's safe from those shooting at anyone/everyone in a gun massacre is for more people to be armed?! Not taking into account how many hot heads might resort to using their gun when they lose their temper too easily?!

Negative Tell Pelosi/Schumer. Its not ok for illegals to kill Americans just so theyll vote for Democrats
Humor Build walls around our High Schools, Night Clubs and Post Offices then
Affiliation If there are no illegal crossings, then there will be no need of a border wall. Simple. Why do we need airport immigration if anyone can just cross the land border illegally?? Democrats wanting no border wall is tantamount to saying we also do not need airport immigration.
Affiliation Build the wall POTUS
Positive All this stuff is really sad. But a wall isnt the solution. This is a propaganda tactic. He's trying to elicit an emotional response from people, rather than appealing to people's intellect.

Negative After u laid of 800k Americans, some of who lost their homes  and apts.
Affiliation Americans are much more at risk of being shot to death at work, the movies, a concert, a restaurant or school by a white male homegrown in the US than a violent attack from an immigrant. That's a fact, no matter how many grieving families you exploit to shape public opinion. Shame on you.
Positive An illegal immigrant hit my mother in oncoming traffic on Cinco de mayo... Glad she is still here.no justice for his actions.
Negative Deception and more lies

Negative Wayne Brunner, I tuned in to CNN today and they had all the Democrats over there vying for more gun control. But the shooter had a lengthy criminal history and was not even supposed to own a firearm but he was able to purchase it. When he tried to get a concealed weapons permit that is when they did the big enough background check to find out that he was not allowed to own that firearm so the government ran by democrats there sent him a letter to have him turn it in. Apparently he didn't care what the letter said and they never did anything about it. The blood is on the hands of the the Region's government. So the government actually created this problem and now they want to step in and fix it simply by taking all rights away
Affiliation A guy from Kansas killed mine.
Positive Its so sad Democrats are so corrupt
Negative What about 167 million for Flint, Michigan water problem. Why is this not more important then a stupid wall
Facts/Logic Dave Callender years ago when I was a child my parents picked up an illegal immigrant he asked if they would be so kind to give him a ride and they did he repaid them by molesting their daughter my sister in the back seat I don't know about you but I don't know any American who would repay kindness behind their backs doing this to their child.
Positive Build the wall, nice and tall
Positive Charlesetta Brown better check with Obamas Chief Border Guard.  Apparently he isnt listening to you or any other liberal.  He supports Trump on his decision to build a wall.  Doubt the veracity google it and find out for yourself.  Interesting that a former Obama official agrees with the Trump administration.  Especially since he is the individual one should listen to.
Facts/Logic Marilyn Carter look it up.

Positive The Democrats don't care about your daughter or anyone son or daughter.  And only people that live with armed security like Chucky and Nancy have Blood on their hands of Americans.  If Chucky or Nancy daughter or son or grand kids.  Would be killed.  This would all be a different story.
Positive And a young white male killed all the Kids in Parkland High School.....what is your point????? Do we do a BIBLICAL CLEANSING" and neutralize  all young white males of a certain age bracket???? See how silly this is??????????

Affiliation Bill Hoeler  I'm so sick of liberal stupidity.  Crime is a state issue.  This is a federal issue since it has to do with illegal immigration.

NOT like Mueller and Comey, but LITERALLY, Stone & Trump have been friends for 30+ years. Roger Stone worked for the Trump Campaign in the beginning. Does ANYONE really think that Con Man Donald KKK Trump was not notified that the DNC was hacked? Specifically, that Roger Stone notified Donald? The excuse will be that it was not a big deal that Russia hacked the DNC, gave the information to Wikileaks, and then coordinated with the Roger Stone and the Trump Campaign to release these emails.

Negative Kate Steinle? Oh wait, Molly Tibits? No? Mandy ? Damn! Its hard to keep up! No national emergency though? Right?
Facts/Logic I don't understand the level of insanity from you idiot Trumpers who, after every mass shooting in the U.S. by a U.S. citizen, claim that "gun control doesn't work; a criminal will find a way to get a gun."  Yet, you think some idiotic wall will keep out illegal immigrants when most of the immigrants are non-violent and most of the drugs come in through legal ports of entry, ships, and airplanes.  I mean...you're just plain dumb.
Positive so sorry for your loss!
Affiliation Agree.
Positive Lark Jarvis you must think you have a lot more knowledge than the men who work for border patrol and deal with situations at the border every day. They do think a wall will help.  I think a lot of people like you just dont want it to help.

Humor Thx Mr Trump...keep fighting
Positive The wall must stand firm, Trump the greatest leader in our life time.
Negative Beth Ritchason those people have a right to be here. We don't need to import more criminals! DRUGS poor over that boarder and Americans die.
Negative It is awfully naive to think a wall along our southern border will stop people and drugs from coming into our country.  The northern border is much longer.  Our coastlines ate much longer.  Tunnels go under walls. Ladders and drones, etc. go over walls.  The main entry point for drugs is driving right through existing and managed ports of entry.  There are smart enhancements to be made to our border security - and in some strategic stretches, that may include a barrier.  But your siren call about a wall actually hurts our countrys ability to work analytically and thoughtfully, based upon reality and data, to ID and implement smart, effective enhancements to our southern border.  Stoking fear is indeed a strategy- but not one great leaders choose.

Affiliation None of us are safe. https://www.apnews.com/Shootings
Positive Tony Lamb .org  I HAD A DREAM!   I have had many end times dreams.   In my dreams I saw the destruction of America. America (Babylon) is Entering Judgement.  I saw nuclear weapons going off in most major American cities. I saw two Asteroids hit the earth. One of these Asteroids caused a Tsunami that was several hundred feet high to hit America's East coast. I saw A mega-earthquake on the west coast that caused two other faults to rip wide open causing another massive Tsunami on the West Coast. Then these earthquakes caused several major Volcanoes to erupt. I saw America ripped in half by the New Madrid fault ripping America in half from the Great Lakes down to New Orleans and this was up to hundreds of miles wide at some points.  America's heartland was turned into a great sea between two continents. And yes I saw Yellowstone erupt with a massive eruption. I was above the earth witnessing all this. But then I zoomed down and in close and I saw civil war in America. I saw Americans shooting and bombing other American's. I saw paper money blowing down the street and no one gave it a thought as it was worthless paper.  Everyone was starving and people were eating bugs, bark, leaves and grass as the hunger was so great. I saw people cooking and eating other people. I saw parents cooking and eating their children. I saw parents trading their children for a hand full of rice or beans. Cannibalism was so rampant that no one gave it a thought as it had become common and normal.   What I saw was in the Great Tribulation and I have had several dreams about this time to come. And my impression was this is NOT off in our distant future but was our near present time. I saw much, much more! The focus was America as America has sinned the most and drug or forced other nations into her abominations. But no part of the earth was spared, every nation, every island, every people, everywhere was touched by this Great Tribulation.  God has reached his limit for tolerating sin. So NOW God acts. The Holy Spirit came to me in a dream and hovered above my bed and spoke 4 words to me. "AMERICA IS ENTERING JUDGEMENT'. I prayed, I cried and I sobbed, I cried so hard because I knew what was to come.   A great deception will soon manifest and the whole world will be mesmerized by it. The faithful needs to be aware of this and not fall into this trap because many Christians will be deceived by this.   I believe this will be alien disclouser and the fact proposed by the media that aliens seeded life on this planet and they are here to help mankind. These aliens are demons straight from hell and they are NOT here to help mankind but to deceive us.  I saw Fallen Angels walking the earth destroying everything and everyone before them and no weapon could harm them.   REVELATION 9: 14 & 15 14 SAYING TO THE SIXTH ANGEL WHICH HAD THE TRUMPET, LOOSE THE FOUR ANGELS WHICH WERE BOUND IN THE GREAT RIVER EUPHRATES.  15 AND THE FOUR ANGELS WERE LOOSED, WHICH WERE PREPARED FOR AN HOUR, AND A DAY, AND A MONTH, AND A YEAR, FOR TO SLAY THE THIRD PART OF MEN.  This scripture says 4 Fallen Angels will be released upon the earth and will kill a third (1/3) of mankind. (I was shown this verse after my Fallen Angel dream.)  Also a Great Shaking is coming to America soon. I do not know what form this will take, economic collapse, war, Asteroid strike, Earthquake, Super Volcano, Tsunami something big IS COMING. And when it gets here every person in America will be shaken to their very core.  ALSO I know the Rapture is very soon also. I don't know when this will come in relationship to these other events, before, during or after these other events BUT IT IS COMING AND SOON.  So pray, look up for your redemption draweth nigh. BUT we who are faithful in Jesus Christ will be raptured out of here and WE WILL NOT BE HERE for the Tribulation.  God Bless you, and God keep you and yours.   www.tonylamb .org  Your Watchman on the Wall For Jesus Christ. Tony Lamb

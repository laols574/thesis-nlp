Affiliation Sharon Fantana there is no big tech equipment that is going to physically stop a vehicle from driving over the border in a place like Arizona. Also if they have to build tunnels to traffic this takes time and resources of the cartels. We've been building barriers under the last several presidents. The fact is some people just dont like Trump and use it as an excuse to oppose him but that does not change the fact of what works down here and unless you have been out in the field chasing this stuff you really can't understand how much it slows them down for us to get to these places especially the more remote ones.  As far as Mexico paying for it. Like I said we've been building barriers and paying for it under the last several presidents. Now I have not read the full new deal that replaced  NAFTA but from what I've seen, been told, and understand is that we're getting a huge swing of money our way essentially paying for the wall. He never said they were going to dish out cash. There are other ways to make them pay. IR tariffs, new deals in our favor etc. People tend to be too narrow minded to think about those things because the mainstream media just pushes what they want. That's why it's more important then ever to do your own research and find the facts not just what they want to tell you.

Positive Trump and his base of believers are like a cult. He claims his wall is already being built, when the truth is not 1 inch of his wall has been built yet. And his followers eat it up. A lot of Kool-Aid is being consumed! Lol
Humor Simon Cardinal those are all problems we have to worry about, of course. There's no debate here. the point here is that the wall has nothing to do with the fact that somebody has been killed. the point is that trump is using a specific situation that has nothing extraordinary to prove his point on a global issue. You cant build a point on such an important issue by playing with peoples sentiments using tragedies. En fait c'est simplement de la malhonntet intlectuelle et cela est une preuve parmis tant d'autre que cet homme exploite les sentiments, les motions et des stratgies trompeuses dans ses discours afin de contourner toute rflexion rationnelle puisque c'est un terrain o il s'est avr tre incapable de gagner.

Negative The wall needs to be built for American Security. President Trump is aware of all the violence in the border towns.
Positive So sad....the left thinks voters are more important than the security of our own people.....4,001 killed in two years by illegal immigrants.....in Phoenix we have 7.5% illegal immigrants.....50% of all class one felonies are caused by the 7.5% of the population.....33% of all drug arrests are for the 7.5% of the population.... 74% of the 7.5% are on benefits for life...at least since the 1986 Immigration Reform Act.....

Affiliation The reason liberals and some so called republicans are so mad is because up until now every president since Reagan has given just enough money for a small section of wall to keep enough voters happy to keep getting re-elected. The liberals dont want the wall because it will keep their base from growing and ruin their idea of a world without borders. The republicans are afraid they are gonna upset the moderates and independents. We finally have a president that is serious about securing our country.
Positive ORourke, a Democratic former Texas congressman and candidate for Senate, responded in an interview with MSNBCs Chris Hayes Thursday to a question tweeted by Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas), who asked whether ORourke would make the citys border wall disappear if he could.  Absolutely, ORourke said without hesitation.  Id take the wall down, ORourke said, adding that the barrier has not in any demonstrable way made us safer.  ORourke said the existing wall has pushed migrants and asylum seekers and refugees to the most inhospitable, the most hostile stretches of the U.S.-Mexico border ensuring their suffering and death.

(Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher.

Positive Painful as it is , this type of situation repeats itself but in different scenarios. But a wall wont solve the presidents ego. Next itll be a some other promise he made to impress the masses holding someone else accountable. Mexico was going to pay for the wall he said . He knew that was a farce . When Irak was invaded , it was because of weapons of mass destruction which were never found to this date . Do not become part of the play because of your loss . Trump is disrespectful of your pain in doing this . Do not let them use you.
Positive I pray that the democrats will see the need and help.
Negative The Congress wastes more in an hour than a wall the entire length of the border with Mexico would cost.   With a multi trillion dollar budget the 6 billion that Trump wants for a wall is a rounding error.
Positive But it will be much,much harder.Every country who has a wall say their illegal's have dropped from 50-95% success rate.Israel is at 99%.He is on the front lines we just have news to go by,and some choose to listen and salivate to fake news..And those who believe in God and his word the bible,it's in many a scripture.
Negative Nancy Pelosi and Democrats have not negotiated in good faith to fund a wall at our Southern Border, proving that obstruction is far more important to them than YOUR SAFETY.  Last week, more than 95% of the Patriots I polled demanded a wall. Thats because WALLS WORK! I was just in the great city of El Paso, Texas, where illegal traffic has dropped over 90% because of their beautiful wall.  I cannot allow Americas safety and security to be put at risk any longer. We need the wall, and I must put AMERICA FIRST!  Nancy and Democrats have said they will consider filing a legal challenge to ensure the wall is never built, as they continue putting illegal immigrants before Americans. So, we need you to make a HUGE statement to them right now.  Im setting a goal of raising $2,OOO,OOO. I know a goal this big is unprecedented, but we need the American people to make a powerful statement to these Democrats to FINISH THE WALL.  https://donate.donaldjtrump.com/finish-the-wall?amount=42&DCPe=ZGpzYWdlQG1zbi5jb20&utm_medium=email&utm_source=ET_16&utm_campaign=20190217_9282_finish-the-wall_donaldjtrump_tmagac&utm_content=gop_direct-ask_text_contribute_top_42_dn

Facts/Logic What a crock. Trump said himself he didnt need to call a national emergency he just did it to attempt to sidestep congress.

But this is making it look like the United States doesn't have murderers of their own. This causes people to hate people that look like me.
Negative Why didn't Trump build a wall two years ago when he had a majority in Congress...Because it was not an emergency. Illegal border crossings and apprehensions have been declining for nearly two decades, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and in 2017 were at their lowest point since 1971. A 2018 study published by the Cato Institute found that undocumented immigrants commit less crime than native-born citizens, and according to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) the majority of illegal drugs coming into the country across the southern border are being smuggled through legal points of entry. In other words, this president has manufactured an immigration crisis for his own political gain.
Positive After all the national emergencies for other countries from the past president.  About time we use one for our own country!

Negative Luke Tierney WALL!!
Affiliation WHAT IS THIS WITH THIS WALL AND THE DEMOCRATS AND RINO'S???? I cannot believe we Americans,no matter what side of the aisle would not want the wall unless you are an illegal or have some personal interest in having open borders.  We desperately need immigration reform and we need the wall..  We may not need the whole wall today but we will need it as time progresses.  Last time 15,000 people came to the border.  How many next time or the next time?  And who or what will they be bringing with them?  We have 3000 miles in the southern border that needs protecting.  We need it for our future.  It is always better to be prepared for danger.  Our current Congress is driving me nuts that they have  become so un-american.  I believe in legal immigration, always will.  I just don't believe in illegal immigration in any shape or form in today's world. Try to imagine thousands of people coming into our country illegally every year with no background checks,no job, etc.  Either should our congress.  All American democrats for the wall please start inundating your representatives with phone calls, letters, twitter, e-mail, whatever way you can to show your support for the immigration reform and the wall even if you don't agree with other legislation the president is presenting.  It's important to our future economy, safety, taxes, educational resources for our children.  Keep our taxes here and our country safe.  an ounce of protection is worth a pound of cure.

Did they travel over by planes or cross over at the port of entry with a granted visa to only visit and return after their purpose? If so, if they were part of the 62% of illegal immigrants that are here by overstaying past their due dates... how is the wall going to stop others? Now if they were here illegally by hiking through the fields and crossing over outside port of entry, then I support the wall. I just want to know the facts.

Affiliation Sorry for the losses but the wall will help in many ways
Facts/Logic It's interesting, a handful of illegal immigrants commit crimes, and you ride on those stories for as long as possible.

And with the lawsuits that will ensue, his wall will not be funded or built until after the next election...if ever.  THE WORLDS SLOWEST EMERGENCY!!!!!  Donny lied directly to Americans about his border crisis.  Our Liar-in-Chief said that all the data that refutes his crisis designation is lies.  Got that?  Our president told the American people that THE FACTS ARE LIES...this is what all wannabe dictators say.  This egomaniac is THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!  Donny doesnt seem terribly concerned about this crisis.  He plans to travel to Florida mere hours after declaring the emergency from the White House. A president, in times of strife, would typically stay in the nations capital to oversee the crisis. Donny plans to do so from the comfort of his weekend getaway.  In reality, Donny is preparing the country for a fake war as he plans to enjoy a mini vacation. The only national emergency in America right now is one of leadership!!

Negative Trump I appreciate your efforts and you are not pts"DISORDERED" for being reputationally assaulted! It's pts INJURY CAUSED BY TERRORISTS AND JUSTICE CURES IT
Negative I think people are so caught up with being against building the wall that the whole idea here is being lost. Replace those words with enhancing security and see how you feel then. If someone broke in to the school your child attends youll be the first people saying How could that ever happen? Where was security? We pay all these tax dollars for what, so our child could be at risk where they should be safe? Or youre at a mall and someone bursts in and starts open fire. Youd be the first people demanding better enhanced security.  This wall is being built for SECURITY to keep the majority of the illegals out. If you are from a foreign nation and want to come here do it the right way. Get proper documentation, medical clearance, working papers, etc. Nothing good is coming out of illegals sneaking across the borders. Lets spend the money to enhance security (wall)  now so that money can then be spent to help the homeless, sick veterans, people who cant afford health coverage, etc, etc, etc who are American citizens instead of continuously paying for illegals who quite frankly, do not deserve to be here.  Has anyone heard of the quote You can pay now or pay later?  Well, Im sick of paying later. It hasnt done us any good. Solve the problem now so we can take care of our own problems on our own soil for American citizens sooner. #MAGA

(Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR

Facts/Logic Convince  the  RETARDED  far  left.  They  dont  seem  to  care  either  way!
Positive 140 Democrats last week voted against a resolution in Congress condemning the act of allowing illegals to vote in our elections.. While they've been screaming foreign interference, they've been the ones to admit it. They found nearly 2 million non citizens on the California voting registry. That's right, they are indeed, after saying they weren't, allowing illegals and non citizens to vote. That should be Trump's next EO. The only thing Cali agreed to do, was to remove the 153,000 dead voters on their roll, but they insist on leaving illegals, and non citizens registered. I don't know how this hasn't already been stopped, but the entire party, other than maybe Munchin, should be arrested, and brought up on  high treason charges

Negative Carol Flores and over 2/3rds of those are related to mental health. The statistics account for self harm and suicides as well.

Negative This was a jarring week as Trump declared a national emergency after Congress refused to fund his wall  perhaps his most brazen authoritarian act yet. Trumps predilection not to govern, but rather rule by an unprecedented executive fiat, set off alarm bells for Constitutional separation of powers, as Trump departed early Friday for a weekend of golf at Mar-a-Lago.  This week the Mueller probe made news as reporting indicated Trumps former campaign chair Paul Manafort discussed a peace plan for Ukraine and handed off internal polling data in a secretive meeting to a business associate with ties to Russian intelligence, and a search warrant revealed Roger Stone was in direct contact with WikiLeaks while interacting with the Trump campaign  both in the months before the 2016 election.  At a Trump campaign-style event in El Paso, a BBC cameraman was physically assaulted by a supporter  symbolic of Trumps continued attacks on the media and his stoking of hatred against marginalized communities. Trumps speech in El Paso and his declaring a manufactured emergency in Rose Garden were both a repetition of disproven lies and exaggerations, as Trump continues to propagate a dystopian alternate reality and act unilaterally.

Facts/Logic The Secure Fence Act of 2006 (Pub.L. 109367), also labelled H.R. 6061, is an Act of the United States Congress which authorized and partially funded the construction of 700 miles (1,125 km) of physical fence/barriers along the Mexican border. It was signed into law on October 26, 2006, by U.S. President George W. Bush, stating "This bill will help protect the American people. This bill will make our borders more secure. It is an important step toward immigration reform."[1] Bill H.R. 6061 was introduced in the House of Representatives on September 13, 2006, by Congressman Peter T.

Facts/Logic What most of Trumps supporters need to understand is that illegal immigrants commit less than 1% of violent crimes in this country. 4 studies have been written, including one by the conservative Cato Institute, that all show this. These crimes that are committed could have just as easily been committed by US citizens.

Facts/Logic Someone on here is a whiney baby that reports everything to Facebook because they can't handle the truth. Walls do work and have worked for centuries.  If you can't handle the truth don't go onto these threads. People who report comments to Facebook when the comments aren't even hateful, bullying others, or threatening are violating people's right to Freedom of Speech. If you can't handle the truth get off the page and you are apart of the problem thus a whiney American Democrat. Stop making false allegations to Facebook because you can't t handle the truth. You know who you are.  If you have a door with a lock on your house to keep people out then we need a wall to keep people from Mexico coming in.  All LEGAL AMERICAN CITIZENS have the right to Freedom of Speech.  I have the right to my comments and so does everyone else. If you can't handle the truth go to a page where you will be coddled by others.
Negative John Garrison they dont want to
Negative That's terrible. Instead of the wall, a better idea is to allocate resources towards stopping Nazi meth biker gangs and incel-shooters born in the US. Pay attention to stats instead of anecdotal evidence. Drunk driving is unique to immigrants, and US citizens don't do it?

Facts/Logic The border crisis has been going on for years and the liberal can has been kicked down the road for too many miles..  it is time to put up a wall, with entry doors called Port of Entry.  Immigration is an old white  colonialism concept that is no longer required since the unknown lands have been conquered and established.  Anything more than that is an invasion. Build the wall

Affiliation What about all of the northern States like the one I grew up on that border another country and have no walls?  It sucks that you can't find a job with the skills you have, maybe try learning Spanish or move to a place where speaking Spanish isn't a job requirement... If 45 knows things we don't that make it crisis now that is more important than helping the Americans in California or Puerto Rico then why did it take so long for him to declare an emergency? Why didn't he do so in the first 2 years of his term when he was trying to get this done? It's not an emergency if you wait 2 years... Jim Jenkins - if control laws take lives, that blanket statement would mean you having a driver's license, being married in the government's eyes, or opening a bank account take lives... there are many countries with stricter gun laws that have lower crime rates. That point on gun control laws was also just simple way of showing that if you support a wall because it could save one person's life, then you should also support guns laws as they would save one person's life, or healthcare for all as that saves one life, or a full transition to renewable energy as that saves one life... more wall is a waste of taxpayer funds if it doesn't deal with the majority issues used to manufacture its need as an emergency, namely illegal immigration and drug smuggling.  Lastly saying that relatively few innocent people are killed by a gun is just plain nonsense. Try telling that to one family members that was killed in any number of mass killings in the last few years from Sandy Hook to Las Vegas concert goers... and stricter gun control doesn't mean law abiding citizens cant own guns, it just means they have to jump through a few more hoops. You loved your wife enough to file paperwork with the government declaring it, why cant you do the same with your gun? You wanted to drive bad enough you took a test showing you knew how to do so safely and show back up at the dmv every few years to reregister your license, why wouldn't you also do the same to own gun?
Negative So sorry for your loss!  I stand with President Trump!
Positive Yes we must!build the wall!!

Trump - what a fool,  gives a speech in Munich, how disgraceful, that is just what Obama used to do - travel overseas and attack us and our country, he always apologized for America.   i am waiting to hear if Biden will plan to run in 2020 because he needs to answer one important question - is he going to continue to take his son Hunter along on government trips so Hunter can come home doing BIG deals in foreign countries like he did when Biden was VP - Hunter flew with his father to China on AirForce 2 and made a HUGE business deal for himself. of course the US media never made a fuss over that.      https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6712807/Biden-repudiates-Trumps-policies-Munich-speech-saying-undermined-Americas-moral-leadership.html

Next election  time  reminded  them of  their  complicity in the  deaths  at the hands of  illegal people at the  polls,  and if you are not registered to vote,  then on Tuesday  go to register to  vote.  For the truth  is  that  most Democrats are  hypocrites. Nasty Nancy Pelosi has over 25,000 homeless people in her district,  los Angeles  has 58,000 homeless people yet they refuse  to address that issue,  but they will gladly  allow illegals sanctuary in their largest cities  and  financially  secure  services  for them.

Negative HERE ARE THE NUMBERS WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND: Yale University released a study (October of 2018) by three researchers, all of them liberal I believe, who concluded the actual number of illegal aliens in this country is not 11 million--it's north of 22 million. Twenty-two million.  The Democrat Party is now, as a matter of policy, calling for the legalization of ALL illegals in this country, citizenship voting rights. 22 million new voters. The overwhelming majority of first-time immigrant voters vote Democrat.   The largest margin in American presidential history was 17 million votes in a 1984 election between Mondale and Reagan. 17 million. You would add to our voter roles 22 million at least permanent electoral majority, in perpetuity.  That's what this (this insane resistance against President Trump and his call for building a southern border wall) is all about. It's not about making the country better, serving our labor needs, and helping the population. It's about putting Democrats in power, FOREVER.

Positive MISTER PRESIDENT! OVER HERE
Positive " 'I didnt need to do this,' President Trump insisted at a Rose Garden appearance on Friday, as he declared a national emergency aimed at shaking loose a few billion dollars in financing for his beloved border wall.  "The presidents assertion was both ludicrous and self-defeating. If a declaration was unnecessary and the wall on track (the wall is 'very very on its way,' the president said earlier in the week), how could he claim to be addressing an emergency? As Mr. Trump explained it, 'But Id rather do it much faster.' A presidential desire for speed does not constitute a crisis  no matter how eager a president is to camouflage his failures." - NYT Editorial Board  "This weeks bipartisan spending bill, which contained no more wall money than the one over which Mr. Trump shut down the government in December, was a particularly humiliating defeat.  "Desperate to save face, the president and his team cooked up a nonemergency emergency with the aim of seizing funds already appropriated for other purposes. Currently, the plan is to pull $2.5 billion from the militarys drug interdiction program, $3.6 billion from its construction budget and $600 million from the Treasury Departments drug forfeiture fund. The White House plans to 'backfill' the money it is taking from the Pentagon in future budgets.  "And so, in a breathtaking display of executive disregard for the separation of powers, the White House is thumbing its nose at Congress, the Constitution and the will of the American people, the majority of whom oppose a border wall.  "Even as he spun this as an act of strong leadership, Mr. Trump acknowledged that his declaration resolves nothing and creates a host of legal, legislative and political troubles." - NYT Editorial Board  https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/opinion/trump-border-wall-national-emergency.html

Humor The Great Hoax of Open border (ILLEGAL) Immigration Policies will be exposed by history as one of the most evil and corrupt actions by our Capitalist Political Establishment. It benefits those with capital who want to employ cheap labor. Our middle-class and low income disproportionately suffer the ill effects and social burden of this sick self serving policy. Thats assuming all illegal immigrants we welcome here arent criminals but just good people appreciative of the opportunity to bare racial and economic discrimination for the many opportunities USA provides. Criminals, Gangs, Terrorists, Social misfits and Powerful Transnational Crime Organizations are able to exploit this horrible policy to our detriment, again overwhelmingly disproportionately affecting the middle class and poor. The people who all these lying politicians have been saying for decades they care about and work for. POTUS Trump is working to force common sense immigration reform because he truly does care about Americans and our country. Controlling our borders is essential and the easiest place for him to begin this reform.

Positive Kimberly Danik We need to move on...Obummer did his dirty work, now we have to do EVERYTHING in our power to fight back, make America stronger again whatever it takes, so join American organizations, make new friends and strengthen the bonds of old friendships, buy American, support all things American, vote for Republicans across the boards, and run for local offices whenever possible, have meetings, conversations, celebrations, f2f positive interactions with anyone and everyone and discuss what is happening in our country, encourage each other, write letters, sign petitions, get involved in your local schools, churches, Vet groups, hospitals, nursing homes, etc, etc, this is the way we are going to #bebest, to achieve what the POTUS asked of us in his SOTU speech, to be excellent in all we say and do, and to unite for the sake of our future. I personally am going to become a foster/adoptive parent now, and hope to influence many kids over the next 10, 20 30 years or however long I have, caring for them and teaching them all the great American values that will enable them to become great citizens of our great country. Also, I have started to write down any pertinent names, info, addresses, email, phone #'s and I contact the appropriate offices, when I learn about any person, entity, politician or group who are doing anything I feel is harmful to our American way of life and freedom. For instance I have been writing, calling and signing petitions to have traitors such as Rashida Talib and Ilhan Omar and also Linda Sosaur ousted from their positions, and at least bring attention to them that shows how many citizens want something to be DONE about their slanderous and evil words, behaviors and deeds. It has to stop, and the majority of American citizens feel this way, or else Trump would not have won the election. There are MILLIONS of us who can do these things that I am talking about, and these are respectful, legitimate and peaceful ways to get our point across and to get results. I hope you will join my efforts, thank you and may God be with us!

Affiliation For more than a century, innumerable studies have confirmed two simple yet powerful truths about the relationship between immigration and crime: immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes or be behind bars than the native-born, and high rates of immigration are associated with lower rates of violent crime and property crime. This holds true for both legal immigrants and the unauthorized, regardless of their country of origin or level of education. In other words, the overwhelming majority of immigrants are not criminals by any commonly accepted definition of the term. For this reason, harsh immigration policies are not effective in fighting crime. Unfortunately, immigration policy is frequently shaped more by fear and stereotype than by empirical evidence. As a result, immigrants have the stigma of criminality ascribed to them by an ever-evolving assortment of laws and immigration-enforcement mechanisms. Put differently, immigrants are being defined more and more as threats. Whole new classes of felonies have been created which apply only to immigrants, deportation has become a punishment for even minor offenses, and policies aimed at trying to end unauthorized immigration have been made more punitive rather than more rational and practical. In short, immigrants themselves are being criminalized.

Negative The Great Wall of China, is a model to us with many lesson; including the story of the King of China who  had a kite maker killed and his kite burned, so that no one would ever fly over THE WALL !  ...there are more important problems in America and a Wall is not really going to help much !
Negative When I post on here !! I hope im giving you good advice. If you want to end this Socialist calling card. That the Democrats are using as a tactic.They want to attract people who are living paycheck to paycheck. You have a history of renting properties. Affordable housing is a major problem. It is swinging hard working Americans to the left. You could ruin this for Nancy and her crew. You could be the champion of the working poor. You need to start a program to subsidize rent based on income. You could fund it by putting a small tax on All rental properties and corperations, sales tax ect. I think this country would be behind you on this 100%. Id be glad to add one dollar to my monthly rent to pay for this. So would big corperations. Why ?? because it would help everyone to have a nice place to call home. It also could be used to provide housing for the chronic homeless people and vets. The Dems have painted you as this rich arrogant monster. This could be applied to home buyers also. You are a great leader. Show the American people how great a leader Donald J. Trump can be ~~ God Bless

Affiliation Diana Klausner theyre standing up to the good old boys club and established oligarchy, they hate when the status quo is upset!
Negative Some of the points on here are good ones. But the big point that some don't want to see. If we was not spending billions and billions a year on illegals. That would be money that could be used to help people with medical issues. Help vets. Help the homeless. We are spending billions a year on people who have not brought so much as a soda pop In this country. As for the water in Michigan. It was a problem long before trump was elected. If the voters in Michigan would quit voting the same people in that got them in this mess. Just maybe things would get fixed. Your water problems are controlled by your local government not the president.

Positive Trump hires undocumented workers? Just five of the 565 companies in President Trumps business empire are signed up to use E-Verify, the governments best tool to weed illegal immigrants out of the workforce, according to a Washington Times analysis that suggests the president could personally be doing more on that front. Mr. Trumps golf courses in Charlotte, Los Angeles and Miami, his hotel in Washington, D.C., and a hotel he operated in New York are signed up. But his marquee Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida is not signed up, nor are his golf courses in Virginia, Philadelphia or Bedminster, New Jersey  where, The New York Times reported Thursday, some illegal immigrants have been working for years. One of them, Victorina Morales, a Guatemalan woman who jumped the border in 1999, has been at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster for more than five years, making Mr. Trumps bed, cleaning his toilet and dusting his golf trophies, the newspaper reported.

Positive Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher.

Positive An illegal alien driving a loaded simi ass-ended a line of cars stopped at a road repair who were waiting on the pilot car to get through. The older couple in the last car in line was smashed into a pickup. The pickup smashed into the back of a loaded cattle trailer and was deflected into the ditch. The older couples car was then smashed flat between the oncoming simi and the stopped simi and were killed instantly. The truck driver was an illegal and was burned in the crash. He was taken into custody and transported to OKC for treatment. There was never any news of what was done with him but I imagine he was released and hauled ass for Mexico leaving Americans with the medical bills and funeral expenses.

Positive Los  Angeles Times  03/04/2008  ""Stanford University called about Jamiel Shaw a week or so ago, intrigued by the slight but speedy running back for Los Angeles High School, the Southern League's most valuable player last year. Rutgers University called a few days later. The Shaw family already had reason to be proud. Jamiel's mother, Army Sgt. Anita Shaw, was on her second tour of duty in Iraq. On Sunday night, it was Jamiel's father on the phone and then his son's girlfriend, Chrystale Miles. Jamiel Sr. called to tell him to hurry home from the mall. The 17-year-old boy was three doors away when someone (Pedro Espinoza ) shot him to death while he was still talking on his cellphone to Chrystale,  Jamiel Sr. heard the shots almost as soon as he hung up. He ran out of the house, raced around the corner and found his son lying on the sidewalk, bleeding."  "Los Angeles police officials described the killing as random and senseless, cutting down a youth who had been doing everything right in his life -- from hitting the books to never missing church to inspiring the Los Angeles High Romans to last year's Southern League title. A police spokeswoman said two Latino men pulled up in a car, jumped out, asked Jamiel if he belonged to a gang, and shot him when he didn't answer. She said Jamiel was not affiliated with a gang". "The youth's football coach, Hardy Williams, was with the family Monday at their 5th Avenue home, where Jamiel's trophies and medals lined the mantel. His 9-year-old brother, Thomas, wore Jamiel's favorite Atlanta Braves cap. Tears flowed. "He was a very special kid," Williams said. "Not only was he an outstanding athlete, he was a good person. I've never seen Jamiel mad. He had such a big smile." The coach described his standout player as "a Houdini on the football field," and the numbers backed it up. As a junior, Jamiel rushed for more than 1,000 yards last year, averaging just over 14 yards per carry. An invitational All-City first-team selection, he scored 11 touchdowns, returned punts and kickoffs, and played defensive back. He also competed in track. Hours before he was shot, Jamiel had spent the day at a football camp at Pasadena City College, Williams said. "Stanford just called me about his transcripts," he said. "Rutgers called a couple of days ago. He was just on track. . . . He was very elated." He is not elated anymore. He is dead. Rotting under six feet of dirt, Donald Trump is his only voice. He speaks for the Dead.

Facts/Logic Danny Jones  Quote Great British culture. I'm a Brit. The EU hate us. End of. So I'd rather we gave the USA 5 billion as a gift for the wall rather than give 39 billion a year to the EU ...  You havent really answered any questions - just added more illiterate drivel.  What is your view of the great British culture and how has EU membership eroded it?  Do answer with specifics if you can. Why do you think the EU hate us? They certainly dont want us to leave but theyre not going to compromise their membership tenets to suit the U.K. - we already have a good deal. How would gifting 5billion to the US benefit the U.K. as much as membership to the EU has?  I doubt youll be able or willing to answer any of the above - just like Trump supporters, youre not that bright and completely misinformed.  Twats like you shouldnt have the vote.

Trying to find the correlation to his status as an illegal immigrant and her dying due to blunt force trauma from being hit by a car.  Do we know that this guy didnt come legally and just stay longer than his visa allowed and that is how he became an illegal immigrant? How would a wall have stopped that?

Negative Funny how all the mass shootings are done by white people ,but you think the danger comes from across the border idiots.
Affiliation This is deeply troubled, but if you only blame immigrants for killing people, you should put even more priority on banning the huge mountain of weapons in your country.  Is it an idea that the arms manufacturers and their factories are being converted into rescue companies that are ready to help people around the world instead of supplying weapons so that they break each other apart. There must be better business models than earning money by causing death. One must be the first, America can make a big revolution so that people get air and can build a life.  With a better life, the need to emigrate also lapses. A win-win situation ..
Positive So what's the problem completing the border wall? Most if not all of us have some walls around our homes. If they are not complete then anyone can get into our backyard and break in right?

Positive White supremacist and other far-right extremist groups have killed 51 police officers since 1990, according to a report published by the Anti-Defamation League last week. Left-wing extremist groups, including black nationalists, killed 11 during the same period.  In 2017 alone, black nationalists and other leftists killed no police, while white supremacists and anti-government extremists fatally attacked a police officer and two corrections officers, the report said.  But while the FBI tracks so-called black identity extremists as domestic terror threats  as an FBI counterterrorism report completed in August and leaked in October revealed it doesnt have an equivalent designation for white extremists.  Experts worry that the broad labeling of black groups, and not white ones, is an indication that federal law enforcements targeting of certain groups is based less on evidence than on politics.  https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article196423174.html

ISIS-controlled territory is shrinking in Syria, and President Trump is declaring a military victory over the terrorist group. But there is another front growing in West Africa.
Negative An illegal immigrant cut my lawn we dont need a wall
Facts/Logic Chenier--This is just one case out of thousands every year. The liberal democrat media refuses to report on them, because it doesn't help their agenda for open border's. The point is, that these illegal's weren't suppose to be here & each case would have been one "less case" of a family losing a loved one to murder, or a killing by a drunk driving illegal.
Warning Look it up the judge said that because he came from a privaledged family he would not have to go to jail....for killing an ENTIRE family in a drunk driving incident. Im not gonna do ur research for u.

Affiliation There are certain barriers that separate and protect, for the benefit of all. There are physical barriers, there are moral barriers, and there are social barriers. Liberals inherently desire to remove ALL  barriers, in their insane rush to destroy everything (Look to Sacramento, Detroit, any bastion of Liberal 'utopia' for confirmation). Barriers WORK, they keep the illegal separated from the legal, the insane separated from the sane, and the corrupt and criminal from the innocent and righteous. Society NEEDS barriers, it doesn't need Liberals.

Humor U.S. Law Enforcement Failed to See the Threat of White Nationalism. Now They Dont Know How to Stop It.

Positive Walls work.
Humor my heart go out to you but how did the Illegal immigrants get in the country I bet it was at the point of entrance
Negative Except for the fact that, you know, a wall would of prevented it....
Positive Point is we don't want to add to the criminal element already here! Come here legally  -  PERIOD!!!!!
Humor Do you think we're STUPID, Trump?!! We ALL know that you inly ean your second attempt at becoming POTUS on the wall only AFTER your FIRST attempt at running on Obama's birth certificate failed MISERABLY!!!! You don't care about who's here legally or not, or even who was born here or not, you are just doing all you can to prevent/stop the possibility of any more people of color running for POTUS!!!!!
Negative Rafael Garcia Hector David Murguia Gastelum
Positive I will Help with the Wall tell me where and when
Negative Sorry for your loss however government statistics show more people are killed by the general population than by undocumented immigrants
Negative https://www.westernjournal.com/ct/obamas-national-emergencies-went-double-digits-still-effect/ congress does not care about the people who elected them. They did not question the crap obama called national emergencies
Affiliation its so heart breaking for all these senseless killings i never wish evil on someone but maybe if nancy pelosis grand daughter got butchered  and killed horribly maybe shed grasp the reality of the situation ..it surely proves mr trump cares about us and it truly proves the left could care less  about us...the left is americas greatest threat to losing our independence and freedoms  and lives   im 100%  for that wall and maybe send all traitors on the other side of that wall because they dont belong on this side of it
Affiliation Yes    BUILD THE WALL
Facts/Logic Leftist love the blood of innocents being spilled. If they're not brutally killing babies they're exposing us to unnecessary violence and risk.  BUILD THE WALL!
Positive Trevor Valescu Bc be likes to see autists flip their lid the moment he does something they dont like.
Negative Yesterday, an illegal was driving recklessly and killed a guy changing his tire on the side of the road. We are a sanctuary state so the illegal will likely walk free.
Facts/Logic Though we have many steps still to be taken and we are thankful for the many steps that have been taken these past two years, the wall is the next step toward America's hope for survival as the Republic for which it stands. Thank you, President Trump. May God continue to bless you and all of us Americans as we strive to continue on our journey toward ONE NATION UNDER GOD INDIVISIBLE WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.
Facts/Logic The dums arent going to support the wall until it hits home for them
Facts/Logic How about all the children killed on schools?  It is always horrible when a child is killed...but we also have home grown terrorists.
Positive And what are you going to do to protect American families from getting shot by a crazy American gun lover?
Positive Wall
Positive Build The Wall Mandatory E-verify Pass RAISE NumbersUSA.com
Facts/Logic People on government assistance support a wall the taxpayers have to pay for.
Positive How will you continue to blame immigrants for everything after the wall?
Negative we know we need it...that's why we voted for you...be the dictator they think you are and get it done and then step down..you're the only one who cares about us
Facts/Logic Build the wall ! Impeach pelosi ! Pray for the Father and his passed daughter.
Affiliation Pax Americana
Facts/Logic Keep after it Mr. President, you are our hero.  Build a lot of wall.
Positive Americans face consequences,  illegals do not.  They get deported only to run right back.  And....how many children are trafficked across that border every year?
Positive Aurora, Parkland, Newtown, Charleston, Las Vegas, Columbine, Pittsburgh Synagogue, Sutherland, Aurora, etc etc etc etc etc etc et etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc incidents of mass murder...  THiSis the National Emergency...not the border
Humor George E Simpkins Jr  its call news.
Positive I have a friend whose grandson was just struck while riding his bike by an illegal driver who was drunk.  He survived, but has broken bones.  He is young, and most probably will have problems for the rest of his life. I lost my sissy to murder in 2009. The only thing that would have made the grief more unbearable, would be if she had been murdered by someone who wasn't even suppose to be in the country!  They are not sending their finest to America, and there are terrorists coming over that border too!  WE NEED TO BE SECURE!
Affiliation Richard Rouse  So dumb
Positive "Against that backdrop, it was Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood) and former state Senate leader Kevin de Len who first began to chart the states course in confronting Washington, releasing a joint statement the day after the 2016 presidential election declaring California the new keeper of the nations future.  If CA is indicative of the "nations future" the USA is doomed. President Trump is astute to this snd trying to stop it.   newsom is a weak, naive, puppet for the "anchor baby politicians in CA, who are favoring ILLEGALS over US CITIZENS. I hope the Feds cut off $$ to CA, it's the only hope to stop the insanity.   http://enewspaper.latimes.com/infinity/article_share.aspx?guid=97518f04-32d5-446a-b4fe-54e87a09a237
Positive You see it all most everyday were illegal kills ,rape children, rape women, and kill law enforcers.
Positive If families or mothers are called angel families & angel mothers of those killed by illegal aliens. What are the parents/families/mothers of those killed by American citizens referred to as? If ICE & Border patrol would do their jobs & if American citizens would stop using drugs & if companies would stop hiring illegals (like Trump) we wouldnt have a problem. Five year olds killed at Sandy Hook & Vegas concert massacre & Parkland. What are these families called? SOL???
Negative Of course, nobody on THIS side of the wall will kill anyone, right?
Affiliation I would vote against a border wall. Only if all politicians tear down the walls / fences they live behind. Along with doing away with all of their security / armed body guards. Let's see which happens first.
Affiliation Carol Zuback Alexander ,trump wants to grab you by the pussy. Well, maybe not you

Affiliation And another illegal killed a girl 27yrs of age
Positive You are the EMERGENCY. Putins puppet.
Positive Mass shootings occurred the other day and you still do nothing
Negative Don't worry you will do it to yourselves what's been done by immigrants, dishonest Americans who are thinking everyone is after them like the revelation 2,9 and 3,9 you will come to worship song of Solomon 1.5,6
Warning Illegal immigrant saved the life of two police officers in Houston pulling them out of a burning squad car.
Warning Long live president DONALD TRUMP.  If you love America  vote  for TRUMP 2020 the best president of USA..

Positive How many illegal immigrants committed mass murder or even murder as compared to home grown American men?  Lets start by throwing you out!
Negative WHAT ABOUT THE BIGGER PROBLEM THE GUN MASS MURDERS.
Positive And of the 5 Americans gunned down yesterday..?
Positive Why do Democrats idolize and protect illegal alien killers?
Facts/Logic Senator Lindsay Graham is now talking about a "coup" by the FBI as well as others !     Yet with a straight face, he's now calling for a hearing, because he's so shocked to hear about all of this ?!   Perhaps its time to remind him ,that he along with the other 7 members of the Gang of 8 were told about  these investigations into Trump and his campaign , PRIOR to his election! Yet, not Graham nor any of the other 3 Republican senators ,or the 4 Democrat senators, with NO OBJECTIONS from ANY of them!!   (Information from  New book by Andrew McCabe) &   PRIOR to the Comey firing!  The Gang of Eight (in 2016) consisted of the following four Democratic and four Republican senators  Sen. Michael Bennet, D-CO  Sen. Dick Durbin, D-IL  Sen. Jeff Flake, R-AZ  Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-SC  Sen. John McCain, R-AZ  Sen. Robert Menendez, D-NJ  Sen. Marco Rubio, R-FL  Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-NY  Is it really any wonder that McCain, knowing this, as well as what Trump was saying about finer examples of Americans then himself, .that McCain didn't want TRUMP at his funeral?!
Negative Well said to hear and see for sure but bad news from TEXAS MAGA country.  El Paso has filed a law suit against Trump  I thought there was a HUGE Rally ?  well yes they were bused in true  Gov't has taken acres of land from an old couple to put up a fence they don't want.  What is going on is the Texas Romance over ??
Positive Ahmad Mahmoud Ouch! That hurt! Smh
Negative Too bad it wasnt one of theirs.
Affiliation Terrible
Positive Fucking liar! You are using the personal tradgity of others for political gain. That is all you are doing. There have been thousands of Americans and continue to be every day who are gunned down before their lives ever begin and you speak out when on that? Never!  Again, you are simply using the personal suffering of American families for your personal political gains and you are a slime ball and a disgusting fake slime ball at that!
Negative One of sister's best friends was killed by an illegal immigrant.  There were 3 illegals in the car.  The driver never even slowed down at the stop sign on a side highway and was speeding.  He hit her while she was driving the speed limit of 65.  She was life watched but didn't survive long.  The 3 men weren't even injured.  They had no insurance and actually tried to hire an attorney to sue the husband of the woman he killed.  They got out of jail somehow and fled back to Mexico.  I always wonder how long it took them to cross back into the states and how many other crimes they've committed since then.
Humor The Border Patrol is inept. They need to be fired......
Affiliation They haven't only killed but raped pillaged and plundered their way across America. Sure there are some decent ones. But when a child of illegal parents tell me this is their country and it doesn't belong to me or any American my blood boils. That they have the right to be here. Its their country, just taking it back from us. How would you feel. Shut the border down and put sanctions on mexico they will pay for the wall to be built. No trade in or out. No one in or out, No money going to their banks and confiscate those dollars. That would more than pay for the wall. in 2017 they sent 56 billion back to Mexico. Don't you think its time we got some of our tax dollars back?
Warning MAGA WALL
Facts/Logic IF NO WALL NOTHING WILL MATTER!
Positive After living near the border and knowing people who worked for border patrol it would be wiser to bring the military home and put them on the border and get rid of the bad border patrol  !  He would win on two fronts bringing military home and saving money because they are home and can be near families and it would be better then the wall.  They should sell all majuana  to place selling it legally to raise money for wall and anyone bringing hard drugs should face a firing squad that will stop drugs and he would be re-elected.
Positive DJ Trump and MC Pence!
Positive Keep wall up
Positive Agree 100%, Most Americans Are Truly Sorry For Your Loss, I Back Our President And The Wall Is Critical For The Safety And Security Of All Americans. Im An American Hispanic Deplorable And Wear The Label Proudly 
Facts/Logic Sandra Nelson Ask the Chinese: Or the French. Trump wants to ignore the stats saying illegal immigration has been declining for two years, cause he just wants his wall. He's a freakin' xenophobe and frankly when he's gone THEN we can start being great again
Negative I'm sure if a family member of theirs was raped or tortured or murdered they would be singing a different tune! They're only concern is for their own agenda! They do not care about the American people one iota! It sickens me that innocent lives are destroyed by the illegal actions of these illegal immigrants! I am so sorry to anyone who has been affected by this travesty of justice.
Positive Trump2020!
Negative I  REALLY  PRAY PRESIDENT  TRUMP GETS THIS  MESSAGE.  IN DELAWARE WHERE I LIVE,  TWO  WEEKS  AGO  THERE WAS  AN  INCIDENT  TO WHERE  AND  ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WAS INVOLVED  AND  THE  DELAWARE  STATE  POLICE WAS  INVOLVED,  AS  ONE  OF THE  OFFICERS  ARRIVED I  TOLD HIM  THE  GUY  IN  THERE IS  ILLEGAL  IMMIGRANT  AND THIS  OFFICERS  EXACTS  WORDS WERE   THATS  A  PROBLEM FOR  IMMIGRATION  NOT  US.  NOW  WHY  ISNT  LAW  INFORCEMENT  DOING MORE? PLUS  I HAVE A  NAME  OF  ANOTHER  ILLEGAL  IMMIGRANT WHICH  WAS INVOLVED  IN  DOMENSTIC ABUSED  CASE  AND  THIS PERSON  WENT  TO  A  DELAWARE  FAMILY  COURT  UNDER  AND ILLEGAL  NAME, SSI ETC  BEING  USED  AND  THE  JUDGE WAS INFORMED  OF THIS PERSON  BEING  ILLEGAL,  WELL  GUESS  WHAT,  NO  OTHER  QUESTIONS WERE  ASKED AND  NOTHING WAS DONE. I FEEL AS THOUGHOUR  PRESIDENT AND  US AMERICANS  WHO ARE  DOING  OUR  BEST  OF  FIGHTING  IMMIGRATION ARE GETTING  NO  HELP  OR  SUPPORT FROM EVEN OUROWN LAWS, POLICE, COURTS  AND/OR  JUDGES.  PRESIDENT  TRUMP  WHY  ARE WE  NOT  GETTING  THE  HELP  WE NEED?
Facts/Logic Bahahahaha one fucking killing and you get this?  How about the MILLIONS of lives trump has ruined?  Buncha sheep who cant think for themselves.  Believe whatever the clown says and forget how to create your own thoughts.
Negative Charles Landry this is not proof of need for a wall. Illegal immigration happens primarily through Visa overstays and the other issues we have with border security are also largely through ports of entry. This is intended to bolster unthinking response by people who have poor critical thinking skills. It is transparent fear mongering.
Positive I am so sorry for your loss, that illegal would have gotten Italian justice right away no time for American justice today these people get off with a slap on the hand when they commit heinous crimes and it's unacceptable, build the damn wall already.
Positive Walls are stupid, they dont work. Almost all crime is committed by American citizens. How about gun control if you care about our family? What's that? You cant hear me over the sound of counting the 30 million dollars NRA gave you?
Positive This man's story is tragic.  But securing our borders, making sure that criminals are punished and can't get back in does not translate into a physical wall.  4th century solution to a 21st century problem.
Positive WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?????
Positive A white guy killed my family member with a gun.   All i got was thoughts and prayers
Facts/Logic Wrong
Humor All of us who support you will support you again in 2020 and all of us are for the wall, but wall that is made superior quality, astonishing.
Negative Amazing the arrogant, ignorant people that are against the wall are so evil, I can not believe they keep thier positions.
Affiliation Build It!!!
Facts/Logic Rosemary Patterson no more free handouts to the red states!  The red states are the most dependent on government assistance!
Negative You only want a wall for your own selfishness
Affiliation You all remind me of going to a dog park. All sniffing each others butts.
Facts/Logic After the last mass school shooting, Democrats and the media were screaming for gun control because if it would save one life, it's worth it right? Well, if we could keep one illegal immigrant out to prevent the killing of one person, isn't it worth building the wall? In their mind, Mandy is not worth it. They don't care about Americans. Just keeping their power and votes they get from uneducated people who like all the free stuff they offer.
Affiliation And electrify it.
Humor Congratulations President, Trump for your fight to keep law and order in the Americas !!
Facts/Logic You are the best  President in the world
Facts/Logic Spinning breaking the law as moral and any means to stop it as immoral is the liberal radical platform. . for votes. It's all about votes.
Negative An illegal  boy ,Kill my husband , certain people dont get it until God forbid it happens to them loose a person in your. Family .the pain never stop hurting never wish on no one  build  the wall 
Affiliation So just emmigrants commit crimes  low blow #antiwall
Positive You're a jackass.

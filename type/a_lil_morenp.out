Facts/Logic How sad. Bless you. 
Negative Tragically they don't seem to care one bit. 
Negative I was working for an employer who had hired illegal immigrants and didn't notify the staff that had been working there. One of the younger a_ _ holes invited me out to his place for a beverage, the boss's son even said he'd be there so I thought nothing of it (we both were young and he wasn't bad looking) so I kindly accepted the offer (2nd mistake) 1st was even talking to him in the 1st place. We planned a time and he gave me the address, now keep in mind I was currently residing in a smaller town where at this younger age it didn't seem to be an issue to go to someone's place. Upon arriving I had to go through a cattle gate, house was out in the country, upon arriving to the house, there were more guys out there than I had originally thought there would be. I then decided that MAYBE this just wasn't a good idea and I was trying to leave in my car, never had gotten outside of it. I found out that there were a couple of men outside and they had chain locked the gate closed and I NOT wanting to destruct property, demanded they open the gate. No one would open the gate, one other guy had made his way into my car and forced me over and drove me back to the house where there were 7 maybe 8 illegal immigrants and a 50+ yr old Male who MIGHT have been a U.S. resident. They dragged me into the home where they forced themselves on me, forced liquor down my throat and then proceeded to take me into a bedroom where I continued to fight them off of me, one by one they all took turns, they all were all over me and it then became a group thing, I fought and fought what seemed like hours, once everyone had their fun, I managed to crawl myself into the bathroom, near the bedroom I was in and in there the 50 yr old man put me into the shower, by know the liquor had kicked in and I was pretty much a lump on a log. So I was finished off in a shower with this horrible 50+ yr old and left alone once all were done having there fun. I yelled and screamed I kicked and clawed I threw punches I even tried to bite, by the time I came too I was naked in a cold shower and even though I was still pretty well lit, I was able to get just enough on to get myself out of the house and my keys and get in my car where I was able to then escape any future sexual assaults. I wasn't even sure if I was going to be held longer or released. I tried to file charges, but after that night all men were on the run including the older man himself. So nothing had ever come of it other than me getting counseling. BELIEVE WE HAVE TO BUILD THIS WALL TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN. I would NEVER wish a gang bang on even my worst enemy. I have gone through counseling and I have over come my situation. I have a daughter now, and I fear that she NEVER EVER endures such a HORRIBLE HORROR. This happened about 12 years ago, but it has only gotten worse since then with the population of illegals. Let's protect our future! 
Humor Protection means we the people have the right to our weapons!

Affiliation WHAT ABOUT THE ONE THAT ARE HERE ? 
Affiliation Laws against drunk driving are already in place and are enforced. Immigration laws have become relaxed and people try to protect those who come here illegally. Big difference in how the 2 are addressed. Did my friend deserve to die when he was walking down the sidewalk and was struck by a female illegal immigrant and thrown 50 feet through the air and spending the next 2 weeks in the hospital before he died. The driver was sober and had no insurance and because of her status as an illegal the state's DA decided not to press charges she lives a happy life in Rockford illinois while an American family weeps. So how will you defend something like this. Even more so when the person that killed my friend had no legal right to even be in the country that my friend fought and served for. 
Negative Idiot 
Negative Sure it is. Look at the correlation of violent crimes and stricter gun laws in the US. Then look at how many people overdose. After that, how many people die from the effects of smoking? And, how many innocent bystanders are killed as a result from driving under the influence?

Facts/Logic SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS VILE VICIOUS VINDICTIVE EVIL demonRATS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HER DEATH LET US NOW DESTROY THEM 
Warning Curtis Rice your a jerk 
Facts/Logic We were hit from behind while on the way to work. The driver of the other car, an older white woman, pulled up beside us and shouted that she was going to pull off to the side of the road. Then she turned off her lights so we couldn't see her license plate, and drove off. Our car was destroyed, and I required medical attention, and she just left us there. Another time an older white woman wrecked our car, and hers, by making a left turn from the right lane without looking. She then, unsuccessfully, tried to convince the police it was our fault. Another older white woman backed into my car in a parkinglot, denting in the front and breaking my headlight. Despite doing this in front of a police officer, she hit the gas and sped off. When they caught her we discovered she didn't have insurance. Once, when driving a work truck on the interstate, an older white man became enraged because I wasn't driving fast enough in the fast lane. I had to be in that lane because my exit was coming up off of it, and I had to slow down to 60 because my truck wouldn't have made the turn otherwise. He sped up, cut in front of me, and slammed on his breaks. Somehow I managed to stop in time. If my truck hadn't been empty, I would have certainly hit him, and we both could have been killed. I have never had an unpleasant encounter of any kind with an immigrant, legal or otherwise. Middle-aged white people are another story.

I probably don't understand the issues you face because #1 I'm straight and #2 a person's life choices, sexuality, political affiliation, skin color, etc aren't really things I think about when I meet someone or pass them on the street. My first impression of people is usually based on whether they are polite and pleasant or have a chip on their shoulder and a crappy attitude. Other than that, I personally don't go throughout my daily life in fear of much. I do believe that illegal immigration is a problem in the United States.

Humor Asha Artis not American but wouldnt most of your illegal immigration problems stem from a broken security system? Im guessing most of them dont walk over the border but are not caught by the checks in place. Even if they walk over the border why arent they rounded up and sent back?

Affiliation Angela K Christensen You cant have national security without border security. Its not only necessary for any meaningful immigration reform; border security plays a crucial role in both the interdiction of illegal drugs and in defending America against criminal threats. Weak borders allow criminal and smugglers, as well as millions of illegal aliens, to have virtually free entrance to the United States. If this was not true then why are there some 20 million ILLEGAL aliens living in the United States now, and why is there a drug epidemic killing thousands of Americans every year, and why are Americans being robbed and murdered by Illegal aliens. Contrary to news reports the majority of these drugs are traceable to drug cartels in Mexico, not from pharmaceutical companies.

Anyone could have been behind the wheel of that car, it doesnt matter who it was. There are drunk drivers all across America, so are we just gonna build walls around their houses to keep them off our roads too? This sounds a lot like a lot of arguments against vaccinations I hear too. Saying well so and so died and she had shots therefore vaccines are bad for you is very comparable. This woman could have been struck with or without the wall, it just so happens to be that the man was an illegal immigrant, and therefore people are using it. Honestly, the logic behind a lot of such issues amazes me, not just the wall. 
Facts/Logic BINARY OPTIONS ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT.. Binary options trade has been developing rapidly over the last few years, This innovative approach to global markets allows people to quickly invest and extract profit from their investments without actually buying the asset that interests them. It is the price of these assets that is the focus of attention when dealing with binary options and the only thing people have to do is predict whether it will rise or fall in a certain period of time (Up or down). these are the only two things traders have to worry about, It was never so easy to become a successful trader all you need for success in binary options trading is a well approved broker to invest your money and get back profit in a week time. Your broker plays this role and point you in the right direction from the beginning of trade right up to the cashout of your profit. With a minimum investment of $300 you can make good profit of $3500 and $500 will earn you a profit of $5500 after a trading week. If you're a newbie or a trader who has been loosing a lot of money recently you can contact me for more info on how you can go about the trading process.

Warning John Gardner California LARGEST INSANE ASYLUM IN THE WORLD Interesting that the LA Times did this. All the others are staying away from it. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, this should be of great interest to you! Just One State - be sure and read the last part... try for 3 times. This is only one State... If this doesn't open your eyes, nothing will! From the LA. Times: 1. 40% of all workers in LA County (10.2 million people) are working for cash; and not paying taxes. This is because they are predominantly illegal immigrants, working without a green card. (Donald Trump was right) 2. 95 %of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens. 3. 75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens. 4. Over 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers. 5. Nearly 35% of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals; they are here illegally. 6. Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages. 7. The FBI reports half of all gang members in Los Angeles are most likely illegal aliens from south of the border. 8 Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal. 9. 21 radio stations in LA are Spanish-speaking. 10. In LA County, 5.1 million people speak English; 3.9 million, speak Spanish. (There are 10.2 million people, in LA County. (All 10 of the above facts were published in the Los Angeles Times) Less than 2% of illegal aliens are picking our crops, but 29% are on welfare. Over 70% of the United States' annual population growth, ( and over 90% of California, Florida, and New York), results from immigration. Also, 29% of inmates in federal prisons are illegal aliens. We are fools for letting this continue. HOW CAN YOU HELP? Send copies of this letter, to at least two other people. To 100, would be even better.

Facts/Logic The border is 2000 miles long what's 200 miles of wall going to do really? 
Negative When I ask my self this question. About the wall. And weight out all the pros and cons. I came up with this. I had a daughter. That was involved in. Human trafficking. She did not even know she was doing it. Because of the drugs and the influence. It had on her. She call us. And wanted to come home for a few days. I knew she was a prostitute. And it was hard to just think that some day Im going to get a phone call. From the police. Saying your daughter is dead. In my heart. Was a broken heart. To think what she was doing. She was MIA. Then out of the blue she called. I asked her questions. How are you. When are you going to come home. She would not say nothing. Out of shame. I would begin to cry. She would say dad dont cry. This is my choice. So I asked her this. What are you doing right now. She told me. She was at the bus stop. To pick up some girls. From New York. I asked why. Because her pimp wanted her to. I told her. That is human trafficking. She said whats that. And I told her. What human trafficking is. And what happens to girls. She took the girls to a safe house. And she had to stay with them until the pimps. Muscle guys. Came and took him away. She told me they were 12 to 15-year-olds. She never saw those girls again after that night when the muscleman came and took them. If a wall just stops one of these acts and prevent someone from getting killed from drugs to me its worth having the wall. If they cant come to America legally then they should not come at all does it read those their grandparents or someone they know that wanted to come to America had to either come here legally or illegally. Lives matters. And walls will save lives. 
Humor GOD S NOT HUMAN. How does he become a child ? Who created Mary. you don't think !!! Kuran CHAPTER 5 maide verses116 And Allah will say, "O Jesus son of Mary, did you say to the people, `Take me and my mother as gods rather than Allah?'" He will say, "Glory be to You! It is not for me to say what I have no right to. Had I said it, You would have known it. You know what is in my soul, and I do not know what is in Your soul. You are the Knower of the hidden 117 I only told them what You commanded me: that you shall worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them while I was among them; but when You took me to Yourself, You became the Watcher over themYou are Witness over everything. THE TORAH AND THE BBLE ARE THE BOOK OF ALLAH. BUT WAS CHANGED LATER. QURAN CHAPTER 2 BAKARA VERSE 79 So woe to those who write the Scripture with their own hands, and then say, "This is from Allah," that they may exchange it for a little price. Woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they earn. GOD S NOT HUMAN. HOW DOES HE BECOME A CHLD? GOD S ONE. AND GOD S ALLAH. AND ALLAH S ONE. AND REAL S ONE. AND NEVER AND NEVER DONT CHANGE. QURAN CHAPTER 3 AL- MRAN VERSES 59 The likeness of Jesus in Allah's sight is that of Adam: He created him from dust, then said to him, "Be," and he was. 60 The truth is from your Lord, so do not be of those who doubt. https://www.quranwow.com/#/ch/1/t1/ar-allah/t2/en-itania/a1/alafasy-64/a2/itania-64/v/2 Quran sure 3 al-i imran 19 Religion with Allah is Islam.

He is just flexing and hoping to intimidate, that does not work anymore. He needs to act smarter. 
Negative We need more posts like this. News only reports about not wanting the wall. Never about the American people wanting it. That's why trump was voted in.

This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. 
Positive I mourn your loss. However, declaring a national crisis and putting up a concrete wall will never solve America's immigration issues. Ronald Reagan once said "Mr. Gorbachev, Tear Down This Wall. Bottom line, this is pure politics. It's all about satisfying his extreme right wing tea party base. Let the experts decide how best to solve our border issues. America is a democracy, not a dictatorship. The president continues to make up things and lie to the American people. 
Affiliation So when are we building the walls around our schools? And movie theaters? And workplaces? And concert venues (need a roof for that one, too)? And when are we putting all of the white males who have killed SO many more than immigrants in this country in kennels? I'm not belittling the loss of even one child, it's tragic and heartbreaking, but declaring a "state of emergency" over a few bad people who also happen to be immigrants does not make sense when we have mass killings on THIS side of the border. A wall wouldn't stop most of they illegal immigration, we know that most come through other routes, and therefore it's false logic to assume it would have saved any of the lives he is exploiting. Do take the money allotted to beef up where they DO come through, and spend money fighting mass shootings of Americans BY Americans.

Stop the unnecessary deaths caused by the lure of an open border, and by the criminals that repeatedly enter illegally and do harm to our citizens and legal residents..

Positive Dear Mr. President Trump, At first, I was a bit skeptical about having a business man run for president when I believed you had little knowledge of politics. Then you began to open my eyes to the corruption that as been in the White House for far too long. Like all business men, your main concern is to protect the company which he has invested into (that being the people of the USA). If walls don't work, then why do we fence in our backyards? (To protect our children from the known dangers of the outside world.) Why do we fence in cattle when it seems inhumane to force an animal to a restricted area? (To protect the investment of their owners and others from harm). Why do we fence in our public schools? (To protect innocent children from savage people who wish unnecessary violence against the future of America). Why do we build retaining walls around our house? (To stop mother nature from destroying our shelter, our home). Why do we build walls around freeways and areas of high traffic? (To protect each other from the negligence of other drivers and to protect our people from hit and runs). Why do we build railings on our bridges? (To protect people from the dangers of failing far far below). Your interest is direct and logical. Let's protect the American people from the dangers of our Southern boarder before the danger/crime/violence happens (Still a little late because there are many of Americans who have lost love ones due to not having a wall). Democrats are doing everything in their power to stop you, don't let them! They are after the votes of the illegals, not the protection of their citizens! You sir will most likely be the greatest president in my lifetime. Opening America's eyes one day at a time. Wake up or fall victim to the violence and destruction the Democratic party wants. Keep fighting for the American people, it's been a honor to have you for a president sir!!! #TRUMP2020

Nobodys done the job that weve done on the border, said Donny as he declares a national emergency today........the slowest emergency in history.

Donny lied directly to Americans about his border crisis. Our Liar-in-Chief said that all the data that refutes his crisis designation is lies. Got that? Our president told the American people that THE FACTS ARE LIES...this is what all wannabe dictators say. This egomaniac is THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE! Donny doesnt seem terribly concerned about this crisis. He plans to travel to Florida mere hours after declaring the emergency from the White House. A president, in times of strife, would typically stay in the nations capital to oversee the crisis. Donny plans to do so from the comfort of his weekend getaway. In reality, Donny is preparing the country for a fake war as he plans to enjoy a mini vacation. The only national emergency in America right now is one of leadership!!

Facts/Logic Here is a little morning history for you. Very interesting... Thomas Jefferson His portrait is on the $2.00 Dollar Bill. This is amazing. There are two parts to this. Be sure to read the 2nd part. Thomas Jefferson was a very remarkable man who started learning very early in life and never stopped. At 5, began studying under his cousin ' s tutor. At 9, studied Latin, Greek and French. At 14, studied classical literature and additional languages At 16, entered the College of William and Mary. Also could write in Greek with one hand, while writing the same in Latin with the other. At 19, studied Law for 5 years starting under George Wythe. At 23, started his own law practice. At 25, was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses. At 31, wrote the widely circulated "Summary View of the Rights of British America," and retired from his law practice. At 32, was a delegate to the Second Continental Congress. At 33, wrote the Declaration of Independence. At 33, took three years to revise Virginia ' s legal code and wrote a Public Education bill and a statute for Religious Freedom. At 36, was elected the second Governor of Virginia, succeeding Patrick Henry. At 40, served in Congress for two years. At 41, was the American minister to France and negotiated commercial treaties with European nations along with Ben Franklin and John Adams. At 46, served as the first Secretary of State under George Washington. At 53, served as Vice President and was elected President of the American Philosophical Society. At 55, drafted the Kentucky Resolutions and became the active head of the Republican Party. At 57, was elected the third president of the United States At 60, obtained the Louisiana Purchase , doubling the nation ' s size. At 61, was elected to a second term as President. At 65, retired to Monticello. At 80, helped President Monroe shape the Monroe Doctrine. At 81, almost single-handedly, created the University of Virginia and served as its ' first president. At 83, died on the 50th Anniversary of the Signing of the Declaration of Independence, along with John Adams. Thomas Jefferson knew because he himself studied, the previous failed attempts at government. He understood actual history, the nature of God, His laws and the nature of man. That happens to be way more than what most understand today. Jefferson really knew his stuff. A voice from the past to lead us in the future: John F. Kennedy held a dinner in the White House for a group of the brightest minds in the nation at that time. He made this statement: "This is perhaps the assembly of the most intelligence ever to gather at one time in the White House, with the exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone." "When we get piled upon one another in large cities, as in Europe, we shall become as corrupt as Europe ." -- Thomas Jefferson "The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not." -- Thomas Jefferson "It is incumbent on every generation to pay its ' own debts as it goes. A principle which if acted on, would save one-half the wars of the world." -- Thomas Jefferson "I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people, under the pretense of taking care of them." -- Thomas Jefferson "My reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government." -- Thomas Jefferson "No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms." -- Thomas Jefferson "The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government." -- Thomas Jefferson "The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants." -- Thomas Jefferson "To compel a man to subsidize with his taxes, the propagation of ideas which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical." -- Thomas Jefferson

Affiliation An emergency declaration ought to be reserved for legitimate emergency situations where quick, decisive action is needed to resolve a crisis. Trump's failure to win approval for his vanity project does not constitute a national emergency. Typically, when someone is facing a legitimate emergency, they wouldn't undermine their own argument for exercising emergency powers by admitting that the situation is such that they don't actually need to declare an emergency. Trump is truly such a special case, that he deftly made the case for his "emergency" declaration by admitting, "I could do the wall over a longer period of time, I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster. And I don't have to do it for the election; I've already done a lot of wall for the election 2020." Later in the same address, Trump basically admitted that his emergency declaration will not result in his Wall being built quickly. If we are genuinely experiencing a border crisis that requires an emergency declaration from Trump, how is it that Trump was able to wait until nearly 25 months into his administration before declaring an emergency? If the situation is so dire, and requires prompt, decisive action, exactly how will construction of a wall that would take several years to complete address the issue in time? Sever dehydration is a medical emergency. Would you advise someone suffering from severe dehydration to begin development of a well to deal with their thirst, or would you give them a glass of water? How do you justify building Trump's Wall to deter border crossings, when apprehensions at the southern border are near a 46 year low? What good will Trump's Wall do to curb drug smuggling across the border, when both the DEA and the CBP admit that most of the narcotics that cross the southern border come through legal ports of entry? How effective will Trump's Wall be at preventing undocumented immigrants from entering the country, when the Center for Migration Studies of New York found that in 2016-2017, 62% of the newly undocumented were folks who had overstayed their visas, and not crossed our southern border illegally? How would Trump's Wall address the refugee crisis, when it won't provide any of the resources needed to process and adjudicate asylum claims, nor will it lead to a resolution of the circumstances refugees are fleeing in their homelands? "Build the Wall!" was never a real solution. It was a slogan. Trump'a Wall has always been a simplistic remedy offered by an ignorant sleaze in order to appeal to the simple-minded.

Now if we could just bring down the prices of everything in this price gouging , hyper inflated Society , so those of us that live below poverty level , could affird to live once again !! 
Negative Bill, Mr. trump is compromised and has proven himself to be an asset of The Russian Federation. Remember when Mr. trump advocated on behalf of Russia at The G7 in Canada? Why are we having a meeting without Russia being in the meeting? And I would recommend and its up to them, but Russia should be in the meeting and should be a part of it. former NBC celebrity game show host Mr. trump - 06/08/18 Why is this not a bigger story? That is not normal! Why not Brazil? Brazils economy is far larger than Russias. Russia is no longer a part of The G7 because it invaded its neighbor Ukraine in 2014! This is not a drill! This is serious stuff! Mr. trump is a national security risk. Im correct on this matter.

(Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.) Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR

Facts/Logic So should we just build a wall around the whole country so no one can get in or out? The south border is not the only border. Also, how many criminals from America have traveled across the southern border to live there illegally? It goes both ways. 911 happened because of a man across seas, complete opposite direction. Should I also mention that this land was taken from Indians, not given to our ancestors? There is so much to this that no one is considering because Trump's phony speeches and false promises are trapping you guys into this crap. Our country has been built on white, biblical, supremecy, and anyone who doesn't go by the book or anyone who belongs to a culture they don't like, they are trying to keep them out.

I cant figure that out. People need to set aside their feelings about President Trump & Congress & strip the debate down to what the issue is. This is keeping America safe, plain & simple. I really dont care if its a wall, border agents, cameras, whatever. Put the bickering aside & just DO SOMETHING! We protect our homes, our possessions; why not our country? This is where we LIVE people! Such stupidity all this whining & name-calling. What good does that do? Put that energy towards something positive.

No, I didn't say fixed or a work around or even kind of repealed. I want it Repealed. And NO(!) repealing the "mandate" is NOT the same thing as a repeal. And no, he didn't promise to FIX Obamacare.

Affiliation Americans are much more at risk of being shot to death at work, the movies, a concert, a restaurant or school by a white male homegrown in the US than a violent attack from an immigrant.

Negative Wayne Brunner, I tuned in to CNN today and they had all the Democrats over there vying for more gun control. But the shooter had a lengthy criminal history and was not even supposed to own a firearm but he was able to purchase it. When he tried to get a concealed weapons permit that is when they did the big enough background check to find out that he was not allowed to own that firearm so the government ran by democrats there sent him a letter to have him turn it in. Apparently he didn't care what the letter said and they never did anything about it. The blood is on the hands of the the Region's government. So the government actually created this problem and now they want to step in and fix it simply by taking all rights away

Does ANYONE really think that Con Man Donald KKK Trump was not notified that the DNC was hacked? Specifically, that Roger Stone notified Donald? The excuse will be that it was not a big deal that Russia hacked the DNC, gave the information to Wikileaks, and then coordinated with the Roger Stone and the Trump Campaign to release these emails.

Facts/Logic I don't understand the level of insanity from you idiot Trumpers who, after every mass shooting in the U.S. by a U.S. citizen, claim that "gun control doesn't work; a criminal will find a way to get a gun." Yet, you think some idiotic wall will keep out illegal immigrants when most of the immigrants are non-violent and most of the drugs come in through legal ports of entry, ships, and airplanes. I mean...you're just plain dumb. 
Positive so sorry for your loss! 
Affiliation Agree.

Positive The wall must stand firm, Trump the greatest leader in our life time. 
Negative Beth Ritchason those people have a right to be here. We don't need to import more criminals! DRUGS poor over that boarder and Americans die. 
Negative It is awfully naive to think a wall along our southern border will stop people and drugs from coming into our country. The northern border is much longer. Our coastlines ate much longer. Tunnels go under walls. Ladders and drones, etc. go over walls. The main entry point for drugs is driving right through existing and managed ports of entry. There are smart enhancements to be made to our border security - and in some strategic stretches, that may include a barrier. But your siren call about a wall actually hurts our countrys ability to work analytically and thoughtfully, based upon reality and data, to ID and implement smart, effective enhancements to our southern border. Stoking fear is indeed a strategy- but not one great leaders choose.

Affiliation None of us are safe. https://www.apnews.com/Shootings 
Positive Tony Lamb .org I HAD A DREAM! I have had many end times dreams. In my dreams I saw the destruction of America. America (Babylon) is Entering Judgement. I saw nuclear weapons going off in most major American cities. I saw two Asteroids hit the earth. One of these Asteroids caused a Tsunami that was several hundred feet high to hit America's East coast. I saw A mega-earthquake on the west coast that caused two other faults to rip wide open causing another massive Tsunami on the West Coast. Then these earthquakes caused several major Volcanoes to erupt. I saw America ripped in half by the New Madrid fault ripping America in half from the Great Lakes down to New Orleans and this was up to hundreds of miles wide at some points. America's heartland was turned into a great sea between two continents. And yes I saw Yellowstone erupt with a massive eruption. I was above the earth witnessing all this. But then I zoomed down and in close and I saw civil war in America. I saw Americans shooting and bombing other American's. I saw paper money blowing down the street and no one gave it a thought as it was worthless paper. Everyone was starving and people were eating bugs, bark, leaves and grass as the hunger was so great. I saw people cooking and eating other people. I saw parents cooking and eating their children. I saw parents trading their children for a hand full of rice or beans. Cannibalism was so rampant that no one gave it a thought as it had become common and normal. What I saw was in the Great Tribulation and I have had several dreams about this time to come. And my impression was this is NOT off in our distant future but was our near present time. I saw much, much more! The focus was America as America has sinned the most and drug or forced other nations into her abominations. But no part of the earth was spared, every nation, every island, every people, everywhere was touched by this Great Tribulation. God has reached his limit for tolerating sin. So NOW God acts. The Holy Spirit came to me in a dream and hovered above my bed and spoke 4 words to me. "AMERICA IS ENTERING JUDGEMENT'. I prayed, I cried and I sobbed, I cried so hard because I knew what was to come. A great deception will soon manifest and the whole world will be mesmerized by it. The faithful needs to be aware of this and not fall into this trap because many Christians will be deceived by this. I believe this will be alien disclouser and the fact proposed by the media that aliens seeded life on this planet and they are here to help mankind. These aliens are demons straight from hell and they are NOT here to help mankind but to deceive us. I saw Fallen Angels walking the earth destroying everything and everyone before them and no weapon could harm them. REVELATION 9: 14 & 15 14 SAYING TO THE SIXTH ANGEL WHICH HAD THE TRUMPET, LOOSE THE FOUR ANGELS WHICH WERE BOUND IN THE GREAT RIVER EUPHRATES. 15 AND THE FOUR ANGELS WERE LOOSED, WHICH WERE PREPARED FOR AN HOUR, AND A DAY, AND A MONTH, AND A YEAR, FOR TO SLAY THE THIRD PART OF MEN. This scripture says 4 Fallen Angels will be released upon the earth and will kill a third (1/3) of mankind. (I was shown this verse after my Fallen Angel dream.) Also a Great Shaking is coming to America soon. I do not know what form this will take, economic collapse, war, Asteroid strike, Earthquake, Super Volcano, Tsunami something big IS COMING. And when it gets here every person in America will be shaken to their very core. ALSO I know the Rapture is very soon also. I don't know when this will come in relationship to these other events, before, during or after these other events BUT IT IS COMING AND SOON. So pray, look up for your redemption draweth nigh. BUT we who are faithful in Jesus Christ will be raptured out of here and WE WILL NOT BE HERE for the Tribulation. God Bless you, and God keep you and yours. www.tonylamb .org Your Watchman on the Wall For Jesus Christ. Tony Lamb

(Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.) Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher.

The EU president was not elected into his post and is meant to be the face of 450 million people in Europe. There is no mechanism to remove him and no way, through the ballot box, that the people of Europe can hold him to account. The European Union is a undemocratic and corrupt organisation that tries to force us to accept one EU currency, one EU flag and one EU state without the consent of the people. It is my job to fight against this and be the voice of free speech - again thank you for your kind message. Yours sincerely, Nigel Farage" """

Affiliation Sharon Fantana there is no big tech equipment that is going to physically stop a vehicle from driving over the border in a place like Arizona. Also if they have to build tunnels to traffic this takes time and resources of the cartels. We've been building barriers under the last several presidents. The fact is some people just dont like Trump and use it as an excuse to oppose him but that does not change the fact of what works down here and unless you have been out in the field chasing this stuff you really can't understand how much it slows them down for us to get to these places especially the more remote ones. As far as Mexico paying for it. Like I said we've been building barriers and paying for it under the last several presidents. Now I have not read the full new deal that replaced NAFTA but from what I've seen, been told, and understand is that we're getting a huge swing of money our way essentially paying for the wall. He never said they were going to dish out cash. There are other ways to make them pay. IR tariffs, new deals in our favor etc. People tend to be too narrow minded to think about those things because the mainstream media just pushes what they want. That's why it's more important then ever to do your own research and find the facts not just what they want to tell you.

Humor Simon Cardinal those are all problems we have to worry about, of course. There's no debate here. the point here is that the wall has nothing to do with the fact that somebody has been killed. the point is that trump is using a specific situation that has nothing extraordinary to prove his point on a global issue. You cant build a point on such an important issue by playing with peoples sentiments using tragedies. En fait c'est simplement de la malhonntet intlectuelle et cela est une preuve parmis tant d'autre que cet homme exploite les sentiments, les motions et des stratgies trompeuses dans ses discours afin de contourner toute rflexion rationnelle puisque c'est un terrain o il s'est avr tre incapable de gagner.

Negative The wall needs to be built for American Security. President Trump is aware of all the violence in the border towns. 
Positive So sad....the left thinks voters are more important than the security of our own people.....4,001 killed in two years by illegal immigrants.....in Phoenix we have 7.5% illegal immigrants.....50% of all class one felonies are caused by the 7.5% of the population.....33% of all drug arrests are for the 7.5% of the population.... 74% of the 7.5% are on benefits for life...at least since the 1986 Immigration Reform Act.....

Positive Behind you 100%!!! 
Affiliation The reason liberals and some so called republicans are so mad is because up until now every president since Reagan has given just enough money for a small section of wall to keep enough voters happy to keep getting re-elected. The liberals dont want the wall because it will keep their base from growing and ruin their idea of a world without borders. The republicans are afraid they are gonna upset the moderates and independents. We finally have a president that is serious about securing our country. 
Positive ORourke, a Democratic former Texas congressman and candidate for Senate, responded in an interview with MSNBCs Chris Hayes Thursday to a question tweeted by Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas), who asked whether ORourke would make the citys border wall disappear if he could. Absolutely, ORourke said without hesitation. Id take the wall down, ORourke said, adding that the barrier has not in any demonstrable way made us safer. ORourke said the existing wall has pushed migrants and asylum seekers and refugees to the most inhospitable, the most hostile stretches of the U.S.-Mexico border ensuring their suffering and death.

(Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.) Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher.

Positive Shame your daughter died. Just glad the wall is getting built 
Positive Singling out people? What about all the mass shootings in our own country?Americans shooting Americans?Highest in he free world. Gun control? The emergency appears to be your mind? 
Positive Painful as it is , this type of situation repeats itself but in different scenarios. But a wall wont solve the presidents ego. Next itll be a some other promise he made to impress the masses holding someone else accountable. Mexico was going to pay for the wall he said . He knew that was a farce . When Irak was invaded , it was because of weapons of mass destruction which were never found to this date . Do not become part of the play because of your loss . Trump is disrespectful of your pain in doing this . Do not let them use you. 
Positive I pray that the democrats will see the need and help. 
Negative The Congress wastes more in an hour than a wall the entire length of the border with Mexico would cost. With a multi trillion dollar budget the 6 billion that Trump wants for a wall is a rounding error. 
Positive But it will be much,much harder.Every country who has a wall say their illegal's have dropped from 50-95% success rate.Israel is at 99%.He is on the front lines we just have news to go by,and some choose to listen and salivate to fake news..And those who believe in God and his word the bible,it's in many a scripture. 
Negative Nancy Pelosi and Democrats have not negotiated in good faith to fund a wall at our Southern Border, proving that obstruction is far more important to them than YOUR SAFETY. Last week, more than 95% of the Patriots I polled demanded a wall. Thats because WALLS WORK! I was just in the great city of El Paso, Texas, where illegal traffic has dropped over 90% because of their beautiful wall. I cannot allow Americas safety and security to be put at risk any longer. We need the wall, and I must put AMERICA FIRST! Nancy and Democrats have said they will consider filing a legal challenge to ensure the wall is never built, as they continue putting illegal immigrants before Americans. So, we need you to make a HUGE statement to them right now. Im setting a goal of raising $2,OOO,OOO. I know a goal this big is unprecedented, but we need the American people to make a powerful statement to these Democrats to FINISH THE WALL. https://donate.donaldjtrump.com/finish-the-wall?amount=42&DCPe=ZGpzYWdlQG1zbi5jb20&utm_medium=email&utm_source=ET_16&utm_campaign=20190217_9282_finish-the-wall_donaldjtrump_tmagac&utm_content=gop_direct-ask_text_contribute_top_42_dn

Facts/Logic What a crock. Trump said himself he didnt need to call a national emergency he just did it to attempt to sidestep congress. Illegal immigrants are less likely to kill than native born Americans. Drugs come in mainly through regular ports of entry. Illegal crossings are at an all time low.

But this is making it look like the United States doesn't have murderers of their own. This causes people to hate people that look like me. 
Negative Why didn't Trump build a wall two years ago when he had a majority in Congress...Because it was not an emergency. Illegal border crossings and apprehensions have been declining for nearly two decades, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and in 2017 were at their lowest point since 1971. A 2018 study published by the Cato Institute found that undocumented immigrants commit less crime than native-born citizens, and according to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) the majority of illegal drugs coming into the country across the southern border are being smuggled through legal points of entry. In other words, this president has manufactured an immigration crisis for his own political gain.

Affiliation WHAT IS THIS WITH THIS WALL AND THE DEMOCRATS AND RINO'S???? I cannot believe we Americans,no matter what side of the aisle would not want the wall unless you are an illegal or have some personal interest in having open borders. We desperately need immigration reform and we need the wall.. We may not need the whole wall today but we will need it as time progresses. Last time 15,000 people came to the border. How many next time or the next time? And who or what will they be bringing with them? We have 3000 miles in the southern border that needs protecting. We need it for our future. It is always better to be prepared for danger. Our current Congress is driving me nuts that they have become so un-american. I believe in legal immigration, always will. I just don't believe in illegal immigration in any shape or form in today's world. Try to imagine thousands of people coming into our country illegally every year with no background checks,no job, etc. Either should our congress. All American democrats for the wall please start inundating your representatives with phone calls, letters, twitter, e-mail, whatever way you can to show your support for the immigration reform and the wall even if you don't agree with other legislation the president is presenting. It's important to our future economy, safety, taxes, educational resources for our children. Keep our taxes here and our country safe. an ounce of protection is worth a pound of cure.

If so, if they were part of the 62% of illegal immigrants that are here by overstaying past their due dates... how is the wall going to stop others?

We have enough home grown criminals to deal with, without opening the border for criminals from other countries. We have far too much crime as it is, and do not need more. So, your argument just worked against you. Thanks for playing, we'll see next week on the wall has begun

It's ok to talk about it. It's a BIG problem amongst other things as well. 
Affiliation Sorry for the losses but the wall will help in many ways 
Facts/Logic It's interesting, a handful of illegal immigrants commit crimes, and you ride on those stories for as long as possible. You show sympathy and support for their families and believe something needs to be done immediately to prevent it from happening again. Meanwhile, over 400 southern baptist employees are found to have sexually abused church members, mainly children....absolute silence. Because those are just the few bad apples right?

Affiliation Linda Durbin One angel family does not a crisis make!!!! Trump declares national emergency... Nobodys done the job that weve done on the border, said Donny as he declares a national emergency today........the slowest emergency in history. And with the lawsuits that will ensue, his wall will not be funded or built until after the next election...if ever. THE WORLDS SLOWEST EMERGENCY!!!!! Donny lied directly to Americans about his border crisis. Our Liar-in-Chief said that all the data that refutes his crisis designation is lies. Got that? Our president told the American people that THE FACTS ARE LIES...this is what all wannabe dictators say. This egomaniac is THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE! Donny doesnt seem terribly concerned about this crisis. He plans to travel to Florida mere hours after declaring the emergency from the White House. A president, in times of strife, would typically stay in the nations capital to oversee the crisis. Donny plans to do so from the comfort of his weekend getaway. In reality, Donny is preparing the country for a fake war as he plans to enjoy a mini vacation. The only national emergency in America right now is one of leadership!!

Facts/Logic Philip Mueller, why dont walls work? If they dont work, why do we see so many all over America? 
Negative Some activist judge is supposed to tell The president of the United States what an emergency is. Where is the worthless supreme court to take this matter up directly. Considering the fact that you have four activist liberal hand puppets on the Supreme Court for the leftist, and Roberts, I see a real constitutional crisis. Supreme court should just state that the Court does not have jurisdiction in this separation of powers issue.

Negative The press and media serve as a check and balance on power which is an underlying principle to our freedom. Power tends to corrupt and absolute power tends to corrupt absolutely. We need a check and balance on executive power.

Negative Trump I appreciate your efforts and you are not pts"DISORDERED" for being reputationally assaulted! It's pts INJURY CAUSED BY TERRORISTS AND JUSTICE CURES IT 
Negative I think people are so caught up with being against building the wall that the whole idea here is being lost. Replace those words with enhancing security and see how you feel then. If someone broke in to the school your child attends youll be the first people saying How could that ever happen? Where was security? We pay all these tax dollars for what, so our child could be at risk where they should be safe? Or youre at a mall and someone bursts in and starts open fire. Youd be the first people demanding better enhanced security. This wall is being built for SECURITY to keep the majority of the illegals out. If you are from a foreign nation and want to come here do it the right way. Get proper documentation, medical clearance, working papers, etc. Nothing good is coming out of illegals sneaking across the borders. Lets spend the money to enhance security (wall) now so that money can then be spent to help the homeless, sick veterans, people who cant afford health coverage, etc, etc, etc who are American citizens instead of continuously paying for illegals who quite frankly, do not deserve to be here. Has anyone heard of the quote You can pay now or pay later? Well, Im sick of paying later. It hasnt done us any good. Solve the problem now so we can take care of our own problems on our own soil for American citizens sooner. #MAGA

Positive Pearl Brown Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.) Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR 
Humor Just hope after the wall is built, illegals that already here dont start killing people to make everybody think trump was wrong! 
Facts/Logic Convince the RETARDED far left. They dont seem to care either way! 
Positive 140 Democrats last week voted against a resolution in Congress condemning the act of allowing illegals to vote in our elections.. While they've been screaming foreign interference, they've been the ones to admit it. They found nearly 2 million non citizens on the California voting registry. That's right, they are indeed, after saying they weren't, allowing illegals and non citizens to vote. That should be Trump's next EO. The only thing Cali agreed to do, was to remove the 153,000 dead voters on their roll, but they insist on leaving illegals, and non citizens registered. I don't know how this hasn't already been stopped, but the entire party, other than maybe Munchin, should be arrested, and brought up on high treason charges 
Negative A US police officer killed my ex, we should build the wall so Americans like him cant get out and ruin other countries lives. 
Affiliation Walls don't work if we still let them in, provide money, an education to their children in their language, free health care, citizenship to babies born here and finally the right to vote

Affiliation The fact you politicize the death of someones child for your own agenda shows how disgusting you truly are. This wall is about securing the far right votes for 2020. You confirmed it when you said I didnt have to do this as in declaring a National Emergency, Con! 
Positive I support our president, Donald Trump! 
Positive Bull O'Neill HHS officials acknowledged that federal officials lost track of almost 1,500 migrant children in 2017 after they were placed with adult sponsors. 
Negative Carol Flores and over 2/3rds of those are related to mental health. The statistics account for self harm and suicides as well. The vast majority of the rest are gang or street violence by people who are illegally in possession of the arms. Depression kills more than violence and alcohol or tabacco kills more than both. Opioids too...

Facts/Logic THANL YOU SO MUCH FOR PUTTING US FIRST .YOU ARE MY .HERO, GOD IS GOING TO BLESS YOU. 
Negative This was a jarring week as Trump declared a national emergency after Congress refused to fund his wall perhaps his most brazen authoritarian act yet. Trumps predilection not to govern, but rather rule by an unprecedented executive fiat, set off alarm bells for Constitutional separation of powers, as Trump departed early Friday for a weekend of golf at Mar-a-Lago. This week the Mueller probe made news as reporting indicated Trumps former campaign chair Paul Manafort discussed a peace plan for Ukraine and handed off internal polling data in a secretive meeting to a business associate with ties to Russian intelligence, and a search warrant revealed Roger Stone was in direct contact with WikiLeaks while interacting with the Trump campaign both in the months before the 2016 election. At a Trump campaign-style event in El Paso, a BBC cameraman was physically assaulted by a supporter symbolic of Trumps continued attacks on the media and his stoking of hatred against marginalized communities. Trumps speech in El Paso and his declaring a manufactured emergency in Rose Garden were both a repetition of disproven lies and exaggerations, as Trump continues to propagate a dystopian alternate reality and act unilaterally.

Facts/Logic The Secure Fence Act of 2006 (Pub.L. 109367), also labelled H.R. 6061, is an Act of the United States Congress which authorized and partially funded the construction of 700 miles (1,125 km) of physical fence/barriers along the Mexican border. It was signed into law on October 26, 2006, by U.S. President George W. Bush, stating "This bill will help protect the American people. This bill will make our borders more secure. It is an important step toward immigration reform."[1] Bill H.R. 6061 was introduced in the House of Representatives on September 13, 2006, by Congressman Peter T. King, Republican of New York, passing 283138 on September 14, 2006.[2] It passed the Senate 8019 on September 29, 2006

Nothing as far as we can see ? You have our support ! We need a wall ! We also need something done with the corruption ? Corruption kills people we never see , just by the action of it ? 
Humor The reason Democrats don't want walls is because they get kickbacks from all the drug cartels... That would stop all of that 
Facts/Logic Don't let this distract you from the fact that Hector is going to be running three Honda Civics with Spoon engines. And on top of that, he just went into Harry's and ordered three T66 turbos with NOS... and a Motec system and exhaust.

Negative Whats so terrible about a wall? A wall is great, almost any other country would put armed guards that shoot on site coupled with a mine field if they had this many people entering illegally, btw look at what they do to people that enter Mexico illegally they are not put up with 2 hots and a cot like they do in the U.S. 
Positive We didn't cancel when Obama was (small p for ) President. He led the way for not being one 
Facts/Logic Someone on here is a whiney baby that reports everything to Facebook because they can't handle the truth. Walls do work and have worked for centuries. If you can't handle the truth don't go onto these threads. People who report comments to Facebook when the comments aren't even hateful, bullying others, or threatening are violating people's right to Freedom of Speech. If you can't handle the truth get off the page and you are apart of the problem thus a whiney American Democrat. Stop making false allegations to Facebook because you can't t handle the truth. You know who you are. If you have a door with a lock on your house to keep people out then we need a wall to keep people from Mexico coming in. All LEGAL AMERICAN CITIZENS have the right to Freedom of Speech. I have the right to my comments and so does everyone else. If you can't handle the truth go to a page where you will be coddled by others. 
Negative John Garrison they dont want to 
Negative That's terrible. Instead of the wall, a better idea is to allocate resources towards stopping Nazi meth biker gangs and incel-shooters born in the US. Pay attention to stats instead of anecdotal evidence. Drunk driving is unique to immigrants, and US citizens don't do it?

Affiliation What about all of the northern States like the one I grew up on that border another country and have no walls? It sucks that you can't find a job with the skills you have, maybe try learning Spanish or move to a place where speaking Spanish isn't a job requirement... If 45 knows things we don't that make it crisis now that is more important than helping the Americans in California or Puerto Rico then why did it take so long for him to declare an emergency? Why didn't he do so in the first 2 years of his term when he was trying to get this done? It's not an emergency if you wait 2 years... Jim Jenkins - if control laws take lives, that blanket statement would mean you having a driver's license, being married in the government's eyes, or opening a bank account take lives... there are many countries with stricter gun laws that have lower crime rates. That point on gun control laws was also just simple way of showing that if you support a wall because it could save one person's life, then you should also support guns laws as they would save one person's life, or healthcare for all as that saves one life, or a full transition to renewable energy as that saves one life... more wall is a waste of taxpayer funds if it doesn't deal with the majority issues used to manufacture its need as an emergency, namely illegal immigration and drug smuggling. Lastly saying that relatively few innocent people are killed by a gun is just plain nonsense. Try telling that to one family members that was killed in any number of mass killings in the last few years from Sandy Hook to Las Vegas concert goers... and stricter gun control doesn't mean law abiding citizens cant own guns, it just means they have to jump through a few more hoops. You loved your wife enough to file paperwork with the government declaring it, why cant you do the same with your gun? You wanted to drive bad enough you took a test showing you knew how to do so safely and show back up at the dmv every few years to reregister your license, why wouldn't you also do the same to own gun? 
Negative So sorry for your loss! I stand with President Trump! 
Positive Yes we must!build the wall!!

Trump - what a fool, gives a speech in Munich, how disgraceful, that is just what Obama used to do - travel overseas and attack us and our country, he always apologized for America. i am waiting to hear if Biden will plan to run in 2020 because he needs to answer one important question - is he going to continue to take his son Hunter along on government trips so Hunter can come home doing BIG deals in foreign countries like he did when Biden was VP - Hunter flew with his father to China on AirForce 2 and made a HUGE business deal for himself. of course the US media never made a fuss over that. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6712807/Biden-repudiates-Trumps-policies-Munich-speech-saying-undermined-Americas-moral-leadership.html

Next election time reminded them of their complicity in the deaths at the hands of illegal people at the polls, and if you are not registered to vote, then on Tuesday go to register to vote. For the truth is that most Democrats are hypocrites. Nasty Nancy Pelosi has over 25,000 homeless people in her district, los Angeles has 58,000 homeless people yet they refuse to address that issue, but they will gladly allow illegals sanctuary in their largest cities and financially secure services for them.

Negative HERE ARE THE NUMBERS WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND: Yale University released a study (October of 2018) by three researchers, all of them liberal I believe, who concluded the actual number of illegal aliens in this country is not 11 million--it's north of 22 million. Twenty-two million. The Democrat Party is now, as a matter of policy, calling for the legalization of ALL illegals in this country, citizenship voting rights. 22 million new voters. The overwhelming majority of first-time immigrant voters vote Democrat. The largest margin in American presidential history was 17 million votes in a 1984 election between Mondale and Reagan. 17 million. You would add to our voter roles 22 million at least permanent electoral majority, in perpetuity. That's what this (this insane resistance against President Trump and his call for building a southern border wall) is all about. It's not about making the country better, serving our labor needs, and helping the population. It's about putting Democrats in power, FOREVER.

Positive MISTER PRESIDENT! OVER HERE 
Positive " 'I didnt need to do this,' President Trump insisted at a Rose Garden appearance on Friday, as he declared a national emergency aimed at shaking loose a few billion dollars in financing for his beloved border wall. "The presidents assertion was both ludicrous and self-defeating. If a declaration was unnecessary and the wall on track (the wall is 'very very on its way,' the president said earlier in the week), how could he claim to be addressing an emergency? As Mr. Trump explained it, 'But Id rather do it much faster.' A presidential desire for speed does not constitute a crisis no matter how eager a president is to camouflage his failures." - NYT Editorial Board "This weeks bipartisan spending bill, which contained no more wall money than the one over which Mr. Trump shut down the government in December, was a particularly humiliating defeat. "Desperate to save face, the president and his team cooked up a nonemergency emergency with the aim of seizing funds already appropriated for other purposes. Currently, the plan is to pull $2.5 billion from the militarys drug interdiction program, $3.6 billion from its construction budget and $600 million from the Treasury Departments drug forfeiture fund. The White House plans to 'backfill' the money it is taking from the Pentagon in future budgets. "And so, in a breathtaking display of executive disregard for the separation of powers, the White House is thumbing its nose at Congress, the Constitution and the will of the American people, the majority of whom oppose a border wall. "Even as he spun this as an act of strong leadership, Mr. Trump acknowledged that his declaration resolves nothing and creates a host of legal, legislative and political troubles." - NYT Editorial Board https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/opinion/trump-border-wall-national-emergency.html

Humor The Great Hoax of Open border (ILLEGAL) Immigration Policies will be exposed by history as one of the most evil and corrupt actions by our Capitalist Political Establishment. It benefits those with capital who want to employ cheap labor. Our middle-class and low income disproportionately suffer the ill effects and social burden of this sick self serving policy. Thats assuming all illegal immigrants we welcome here arent criminals but just good people appreciative of the opportunity to bare racial and economic discrimination for the many opportunities USA provides. Criminals, Gangs, Terrorists, Social misfits and Powerful Transnational Crime Organizations are able to exploit this horrible policy to our detriment, again overwhelmingly disproportionately affecting the middle class and poor. The people who all these lying politicians have been saying for decades they care about and work for. POTUS Trump is working to force common sense immigration reform because he truly does care about Americans and our country. Controlling our borders is essential and the easiest place for him to begin this reform.

Positive Kimberly Danik We need to move on...Obummer did his dirty work, now we have to do EVERYTHING in our power to fight back, make America stronger again whatever it takes, so join American organizations, make new friends and strengthen the bonds of old friendships, buy American, support all things American, vote for Republicans across the boards, and run for local offices whenever possible, have meetings, conversations, celebrations, f2f positive interactions with anyone and everyone and discuss what is happening in our country, encourage each other, write letters, sign petitions, get involved in your local schools, churches, Vet groups, hospitals, nursing homes, etc, etc, this is the way we are going to #bebest, to achieve what the POTUS asked of us in his SOTU speech, to be excellent in all we say and do, and to unite for the sake of our future. I personally am going to become a foster/adoptive parent now, and hope to influence many kids over the next 10, 20 30 years or however long I have, caring for them and teaching them all the great American values that will enable them to become great citizens of our great country. Also, I have started to write down any pertinent names, info, addresses, email, phone #'s and I contact the appropriate offices, when I learn about any person, entity, politician or group who are doing anything I feel is harmful to our American way of life and freedom. For instance I have been writing, calling and signing petitions to have traitors such as Rashida Talib and Ilhan Omar and also Linda Sosaur ousted from their positions, and at least bring attention to them that shows how many citizens want something to be DONE about their slanderous and evil words, behaviors and deeds. It has to stop, and the majority of American citizens feel this way, or else Trump would not have won the election. There are MILLIONS of us who can do these things that I am talking about, and these are respectful, legitimate and peaceful ways to get our point across and to get results. I hope you will join my efforts, thank you and may God be with us!

Affiliation For more than a century, innumerable studies have confirmed two simple yet powerful truths about the relationship between immigration and crime: immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes or be behind bars than the native-born, and high rates of immigration are associated with lower rates of violent crime and property crime. This holds true for both legal immigrants and the unauthorized, regardless of their country of origin or level of education. In other words, the overwhelming majority of immigrants are not criminals by any commonly accepted definition of the term. For this reason, harsh immigration policies are not effective in fighting crime. Unfortunately, immigration policy is frequently shaped more by fear and stereotype than by empirical evidence. As a result, immigrants have the stigma of criminality ascribed to them by an ever-evolving assortment of laws and immigration-enforcement mechanisms. Put differently, immigrants are being defined more and more as threats. Whole new classes of felonies have been created which apply only to immigrants, deportation has become a punishment for even minor offenses, and policies aimed at trying to end unauthorized immigration have been made more punitive rather than more rational and practical. In short, immigrants themselves are being criminalized.

You need to start a program to subsidize rent based on income. You could fund it by putting a small tax on All rental properties and corperations, sales tax ect. I think this country would be behind you on this 100%. Id be glad to add one dollar to my monthly rent to pay for this. So would big corperations. Why ?? because it would help everyone to have a nice place to call home. It also could be used to provide housing for the chronic homeless people and vets. The Dems have painted you as this rich arrogant monster. This could be applied to home buyers also. You are a great leader. Show the American people how great a leader Donald J.

That would be money that could be used to help people with medical issues. Help vets. Help the homeless. We are spending billions a year on people who have not brought so much as a soda pop In this country. As for the water in Michigan. It was a problem long before trump was elected.

Mr. Trumps golf courses in Charlotte, Los Angeles and Miami, his hotel in Washington, D.C., and a hotel he operated in New York are signed up.

One of them, Victorina Morales, a Guatemalan woman who jumped the border in 1999, has been at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster for more than five years, making Mr. Trumps bed, cleaning his toilet and dusting his golf trophies, the newspaper reported.

Positive Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.) Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher.

Positive An illegal alien driving a loaded simi ass-ended a line of cars stopped at a road repair who were waiting on the pilot car to get through. The older couple in the last car in line was smashed into a pickup. The pickup smashed into the back of a loaded cattle trailer and was deflected into the ditch. The older couples car was then smashed flat between the oncoming simi and the stopped simi and were killed instantly. The truck driver was an illegal and was burned in the crash. He was taken into custody and transported to OKC for treatment. There was never any news of what was done with him but I imagine he was released and hauled ass for Mexico leaving Americans with the medical bills and funeral expenses.

Positive Los Angeles Times 03/04/2008 ""Stanford University called about Jamiel Shaw a week or so ago, intrigued by the slight but speedy running back for Los Angeles High School, the Southern League's most valuable player last year. Rutgers University called a few days later. The Shaw family already had reason to be proud. Jamiel's mother, Army Sgt. Anita Shaw, was on her second tour of duty in Iraq. On Sunday night, it was Jamiel's father on the phone and then his son's girlfriend, Chrystale Miles. Jamiel Sr. called to tell him to hurry home from the mall. The 17-year-old boy was three doors away when someone (Pedro Espinoza ) shot him to death while he was still talking on his cellphone to Chrystale, Jamiel Sr. heard the shots almost as soon as he hung up. He ran out of the house, raced around the corner and found his son lying on the sidewalk, bleeding." "Los Angeles police officials described the killing as random and senseless, cutting down a youth who had been doing everything right in his life -- from hitting the books to never missing church to inspiring the Los Angeles High Romans to last year's Southern League title. A police spokeswoman said two Latino men pulled up in a car, jumped out, asked Jamiel if he belonged to a gang, and shot him when he didn't answer. She said Jamiel was not affiliated with a gang". "The youth's football coach, Hardy Williams, was with the family Monday at their 5th Avenue home, where Jamiel's trophies and medals lined the mantel. His 9-year-old brother, Thomas, wore Jamiel's favorite Atlanta Braves cap. Tears flowed. "He was a very special kid," Williams said. "Not only was he an outstanding athlete, he was a good person. I've never seen Jamiel mad. He had such a big smile." The coach described his standout player as "a Houdini on the football field," and the numbers backed it up. As a junior, Jamiel rushed for more than 1,000 yards last year, averaging just over 14 yards per carry. An invitational All-City first-team selection, he scored 11 touchdowns, returned punts and kickoffs, and played defensive back. He also competed in track. Hours before he was shot, Jamiel had spent the day at a football camp at Pasadena City College, Williams said. "Stanford just called me about his transcripts," he said. "Rutgers called a couple of days ago. He was just on track. . . . He was very elated." He is not elated anymore. He is dead. Rotting under six feet of dirt, Donald Trump is his only voice. He speaks for the Dead.

Facts/Logic Danny Jones Quote Great British culture. I'm a Brit. The EU hate us. End of. So I'd rather we gave the USA 5 billion as a gift for the wall rather than give 39 billion a year to the EU ... You havent really answered any questions - just added more illiterate drivel. What is your view of the great British culture and how has EU membership eroded it? Do answer with specifics if you can. Why do you think the EU hate us? They certainly dont want us to leave but theyre not going to compromise their membership tenets to suit the U.K. - we already have a good deal. How would gifting 5billion to the US benefit the U.K. as much as membership to the EU has? I doubt youll be able or willing to answer any of the above - just like Trump supporters, youre not that bright and completely misinformed. Twats like you shouldnt have the vote.

Negative Funny how all the mass shootings are done by white people ,but you think the danger comes from across the border idiots. 
Affiliation This is deeply troubled, but if you only blame immigrants for killing people, you should put even more priority on banning the huge mountain of weapons in your country. Is it an idea that the arms manufacturers and their factories are being converted into rescue companies that are ready to help people around the world instead of supplying weapons so that they break each other apart. There must be better business models than earning money by causing death. One must be the first, America can make a big revolution so that people get air and can build a life. With a better life, the need to emigrate also lapses. A win-win situation .. 
Positive So what's the problem completing the border wall? Most if not all of us have some walls around our homes. If they are not complete then anyone can get into our backyard and break in right?

Positive White supremacist and other far-right extremist groups have killed 51 police officers since 1990, according to a report published by the Anti-Defamation League last week. Left-wing extremist groups, including black nationalists, killed 11 during the same period. In 2017 alone, black nationalists and other leftists killed no police, while white supremacists and anti-government extremists fatally attacked a police officer and two corrections officers, the report said. But while the FBI tracks so-called black identity extremists as domestic terror threats as an FBI counterterrorism report completed in August and leaked in October revealed it doesnt have an equivalent designation for white extremists. Experts worry that the broad labeling of black groups, and not white ones, is an indication that federal law enforcements targeting of certain groups is based less on evidence than on politics. https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article196423174.html

Liberals inherently desire to remove ALL barriers, in their insane rush to destroy everything (Look to Sacramento, Detroit, any bastion of Liberal 'utopia' for confirmation). Barriers WORK, they keep the illegal separated from the legal, the insane separated from the sane, and the corrupt and criminal from the innocent and righteous.

Negative Matt McNamee Nic Harcus 
Positive Walls work. 
Humor my heart go out to you but how did the Illegal immigrants get in the country I bet it was at the point of entrance 
Negative Except for the fact that, you know, a wall would of prevented it.... 
Positive Point is we don't want to add to the criminal element already here! Come here legally - PERIOD!!!!! 
Humor Do you think we're STUPID, Trump?!! We ALL know that you inly ean your second attempt at becoming POTUS on the wall only AFTER your FIRST attempt at running on Obama's birth certificate failed MISERABLY!!!! You don't care about who's here legally or not, or even who was born here or not, you are just doing all you can to prevent/stop the possibility of any more people of color running for POTUS!!!!! 
Negative Rafael Garcia Hector David Murguia Gastelum 
Positive I will Help with the Wall tell me where and when 
Negative Sorry for your loss however government statistics show more people are killed by the general population than by undocumented immigrants 
Negative https://www.westernjournal.com/ct/obamas-national-emergencies-went-double-digits-still-effect/ congress does not care about the people who elected them. They did not question the crap obama called national emergencies 
Affiliation its so heart breaking for all these senseless killings i never wish evil on someone but maybe if nancy pelosis grand daughter got butchered and killed horribly maybe shed grasp the reality of the situation ..it surely proves mr trump cares about us and it truly proves the left could care less about us...the left is americas greatest threat to losing our independence and freedoms and lives im 100% for that wall and maybe send all traitors on the other side of that wall because they dont belong on this side of it 
Affiliation Yes BUILD THE WALL 
Facts/Logic Leftist love the blood of innocents being spilled. If they're not brutally killing babies they're exposing us to unnecessary violence and risk. BUILD THE WALL! 
Positive Trevor Valescu Bc be likes to see autists flip their lid the moment he does something they dont like. 
Negative Yesterday, an illegal was driving recklessly and killed a guy changing his tire on the side of the road. We are a sanctuary state so the illegal will likely walk free. 
Facts/Logic Though we have many steps still to be taken and we are thankful for the many steps that have been taken these past two years, the wall is the next step toward America's hope for survival as the Republic for which it stands. Thank you, President Trump. May God continue to bless you and all of us Americans as we strive to continue on our journey toward ONE NATION UNDER GOD INDIVISIBLE WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. 
Facts/Logic The dums arent going to support the wall until it hits home for them 
Facts/Logic How about all the children killed on schools? It is always horrible when a child is killed...but we also have home grown terrorists. 
Positive And what are you going to do to protect American families from getting shot by a crazy American gun lover? 
Positive Wall 
Positive Build The Wall Mandatory E-verify Pass RAISE NumbersUSA.com 
Facts/Logic People on government assistance support a wall the taxpayers have to pay for. 
Positive How will you continue to blame immigrants for everything after the wall? 
Negative we know we need it...that's why we voted for you...be the dictator they think you are and get it done and then step down..you're the only one who cares about us 
Facts/Logic Build the wall ! Impeach pelosi ! Pray for the Father and his passed daughter. 
Affiliation Pax Americana 
Facts/Logic Keep after it Mr. President, you are our hero. Build a lot of wall. 
Positive Americans face consequences, illegals do not. They get deported only to run right back. And....how many children are trafficked across that border every year? 
Positive Aurora, Parkland, Newtown, Charleston, Las Vegas, Columbine, Pittsburgh Synagogue, Sutherland, Aurora, etc etc etc etc etc etc et etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc incidents of mass murder... THiSis the National Emergency...not the border 
Humor George E Simpkins Jr its call news. 
Positive I have a friend whose grandson was just struck while riding his bike by an illegal driver who was drunk. He survived, but has broken bones. He is young, and most probably will have problems for the rest of his life. I lost my sissy to murder in 2009. The only thing that would have made the grief more unbearable, would be if she had been murdered by someone who wasn't even suppose to be in the country! They are not sending their finest to America, and there are terrorists coming over that border too! WE NEED TO BE SECURE! 
Affiliation Richard Rouse So dumb 
Positive "Against that backdrop, it was Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood) and former state Senate leader Kevin de Len who first began to chart the states course in confronting Washington, releasing a joint statement the day after the 2016 presidential election declaring California the new keeper of the nations future. If CA is indicative of the "nations future" the USA is doomed. President Trump is astute to this snd trying to stop it. newsom is a weak, naive, puppet for the "anchor baby politicians in CA, who are favoring ILLEGALS over US CITIZENS. I hope the Feds cut off $$ to CA, it's the only hope to stop the insanity. http://enewspaper.latimes.com/infinity/article_share.aspx?guid=97518f04-32d5-446a-b4fe-54e87a09a237 
Positive You see it all most everyday were illegal kills ,rape children, rape women, and kill law enforcers. 
Positive If families or mothers are called angel families & angel mothers of those killed by illegal aliens. What are the parents/families/mothers of those killed by American citizens referred to as? If ICE & Border patrol would do their jobs & if American citizens would stop using drugs & if companies would stop hiring illegals (like Trump) we wouldnt have a problem. Five year olds killed at Sandy Hook & Vegas concert massacre & Parkland. What are these families called? SOL??? 
Negative Of course, nobody on THIS side of the wall will kill anyone, right? 
Affiliation I would vote against a border wall. Only if all politicians tear down the walls / fences they live behind. Along with doing away with all of their security / armed body guards. Let's see which happens first. 
Affiliation Carol Zuback Alexander ,trump wants to grab you by the pussy. Well, maybe not you 
Warning PRES. DONALD TRUMP 
Affiliation Build that wall! An illegal killed my 11 year old nephew also. 
Affiliation Dont wait until its your loved one! 
Positive As for Mexuco not paying it...oh they will.Now they have to take care of the people that live there because they cant get here.The funny thing is they didnt want the caravans going thru either and lol the people in Mexico were protesting the fact they were invaded.Aint that a kicker 
Affiliation And another illegal killed a girl 27yrs of age 
Positive You are the EMERGENCY. Putins puppet. 
Positive Mass shootings occurred the other day and you still do nothing 
Negative Don't worry you will do it to yourselves what's been done by immigrants, dishonest Americans who are thinking everyone is after them like the revelation 2,9 and 3,9 you will come to worship song of Solomon 1.5,6 
Warning Illegal immigrant saved the life of two police officers in Houston pulling them out of a burning squad car. 
Warning Long live president DONALD TRUMP. If you love America vote for TRUMP 2020 the best president of USA.. 
Negative I'm more than disappointed in the GOP, especially Rand Paul! Stop playing fair with them! They're not fair with you or us! Start naming names and exposing them every time they vote against you! Tell it all! You're entirely too kind, sir.

Positive How many illegal immigrants committed mass murder or even murder as compared to home grown American men? Lets start by throwing you out! 
Negative WHAT ABOUT THE BIGGER PROBLEM THE GUN MASS MURDERS. 
Positive And of the 5 Americans gunned down yesterday..? 
Positive Why do Democrats idolize and protect illegal alien killers? 
Facts/Logic Senator Lindsay Graham is now talking about a "coup" by the FBI as well as others ! Yet with a straight face, he's now calling for a hearing, because he's so shocked to hear about all of this ?! Perhaps its time to remind him ,that he along with the other 7 members of the Gang of 8 were told about these investigations into Trump and his campaign , PRIOR to his election! Yet, not Graham nor any of the other 3 Republican senators ,or the 4 Democrat senators, with NO OBJECTIONS from ANY of them!! (Information from New book by Andrew McCabe) & PRIOR to the Comey firing! The Gang of Eight (in 2016) consisted of the following four Democratic and four Republican senators Sen. Michael Bennet, D-CO Sen. Dick Durbin, D-IL Sen. Jeff Flake, R-AZ Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-SC Sen. John McCain, R-AZ Sen. Robert Menendez, D-NJ Sen. Marco Rubio, R-FL Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-NY Is it really any wonder that McCain, knowing this, as well as what Trump was saying about finer examples of Americans then himself, .that McCain didn't want TRUMP at his funeral?! 
Negative Well said to hear and see for sure but bad news from TEXAS MAGA country. El Paso has filed a law suit against Trump I thought there was a HUGE Rally ? well yes they were bused in true Gov't has taken acres of land from an old couple to put up a fence they don't want. What is going on is the Texas Romance over ?? 
Positive Ahmad Mahmoud Ouch! That hurt! Smh 
Negative Too bad it wasnt one of theirs. 
Affiliation Terrible 
Positive Fucking liar! You are using the personal tradgity of others for political gain. That is all you are doing. There have been thousands of Americans and continue to be every day who are gunned down before their lives ever begin and you speak out when on that? Never! Again, you are simply using the personal suffering of American families for your personal political gains and you are a slime ball and a disgusting fake slime ball at that! 
Negative One of sister's best friends was killed by an illegal immigrant. There were 3 illegals in the car. The driver never even slowed down at the stop sign on a side highway and was speeding. He hit her while she was driving the speed limit of 65. She was life watched but didn't survive long. The 3 men weren't even injured. They had no insurance and actually tried to hire an attorney to sue the husband of the woman he killed. They got out of jail somehow and fled back to Mexico. I always wonder how long it took them to cross back into the states and how many other crimes they've committed since then. 
Humor The Border Patrol is inept. They need to be fired...... 
Affiliation They haven't only killed but raped pillaged and plundered their way across America. Sure there are some decent ones. But when a child of illegal parents tell me this is their country and it doesn't belong to me or any American my blood boils. That they have the right to be here. Its their country, just taking it back from us. How would you feel. Shut the border down and put sanctions on mexico they will pay for the wall to be built. No trade in or out. No one in or out, No money going to their banks and confiscate those dollars. That would more than pay for the wall. in 2017 they sent 56 billion back to Mexico. Don't you think its time we got some of our tax dollars back? 
Warning MAGA WALL 
Facts/Logic IF NO WALL NOTHING WILL MATTER! 
Positive After living near the border and knowing people who worked for border patrol it would be wiser to bring the military home and put them on the border and get rid of the bad border patrol ! He would win on two fronts bringing military home and saving money because they are home and can be near families and it would be better then the wall. They should sell all majuana to place selling it legally to raise money for wall and anyone bringing hard drugs should face a firing squad that will stop drugs and he would be re-elected. 
Positive DJ Trump and MC Pence! 
Positive Keep wall up 
Positive Agree 100%, Most Americans Are Truly Sorry For Your Loss, I Back Our President And The Wall Is Critical For The Safety And Security Of All Americans. Im An American Hispanic Deplorable And Wear The Label Proudly 
Facts/Logic Sandra Nelson Ask the Chinese: Or the French. Trump wants to ignore the stats saying illegal immigration has been declining for two years, cause he just wants his wall. He's a freakin' xenophobe and frankly when he's gone THEN we can start being great again 
Negative I'm sure if a family member of theirs was raped or tortured or murdered they would be singing a different tune! They're only concern is for their own agenda! They do not care about the American people one iota! It sickens me that innocent lives are destroyed by the illegal actions of these illegal immigrants! I am so sorry to anyone who has been affected by this travesty of justice. 
Positive Trump2020! 
Negative I REALLY PRAY PRESIDENT TRUMP GETS THIS MESSAGE. IN DELAWARE WHERE I LIVE, TWO WEEKS AGO THERE WAS AN INCIDENT TO WHERE AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WAS INVOLVED AND THE DELAWARE STATE POLICE WAS INVOLVED, AS ONE OF THE OFFICERS ARRIVED I TOLD HIM THE GUY IN THERE IS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT AND THIS OFFICERS EXACTS WORDS WERE THATS A PROBLEM FOR IMMIGRATION NOT US. NOW WHY ISNT LAW INFORCEMENT DOING MORE? PLUS I HAVE A NAME OF ANOTHER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WHICH WAS INVOLVED IN DOMENSTIC ABUSED CASE AND THIS PERSON WENT TO A DELAWARE FAMILY COURT UNDER AND ILLEGAL NAME, SSI ETC BEING USED AND THE JUDGE WAS INFORMED OF THIS PERSON BEING ILLEGAL, WELL GUESS WHAT, NO OTHER QUESTIONS WERE ASKED AND NOTHING WAS DONE. I FEEL AS THOUGHOUR PRESIDENT AND US AMERICANS WHO ARE DOING OUR BEST OF FIGHTING IMMIGRATION ARE GETTING NO HELP OR SUPPORT FROM EVEN OUROWN LAWS, POLICE, COURTS AND/OR JUDGES. PRESIDENT TRUMP WHY ARE WE NOT GETTING THE HELP WE NEED? 
Facts/Logic Bahahahaha one fucking killing and you get this? How about the MILLIONS of lives trump has ruined? Buncha sheep who cant think for themselves. Believe whatever the clown says and forget how to create your own thoughts. 
Negative Charles Landry this is not proof of need for a wall. Illegal immigration happens primarily through Visa overstays and the other issues we have with border security are also largely through ports of entry. This is intended to bolster unthinking response by people who have poor critical thinking skills. It is transparent fear mongering. 
Positive I am so sorry for your loss, that illegal would have gotten Italian justice right away no time for American justice today these people get off with a slap on the hand when they commit heinous crimes and it's unacceptable, build the damn wall already. 
Positive Walls are stupid, they dont work. Almost all crime is committed by American citizens. How about gun control if you care about our family? What's that? You cant hear me over the sound of counting the 30 million dollars NRA gave you? 
Positive This man's story is tragic. But securing our borders, making sure that criminals are punished and can't get back in does not translate into a physical wall. 4th century solution to a 21st century problem. 
Positive WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR????? 
Positive A white guy killed my family member with a gun. All i got was thoughts and prayers 
Facts/Logic Wrong 
Humor All of us who support you will support you again in 2020 and all of us are for the wall, but wall that is made superior quality, astonishing. 
Negative Amazing the arrogant, ignorant people that are against the wall are so evil, I can not believe they keep thier positions. 
Affiliation Build It!!! 
Facts/Logic Rosemary Patterson no more free handouts to the red states! The red states are the most dependent on government assistance! 
Negative You only want a wall for your own selfishness 
Affiliation You all remind me of going to a dog park. All sniffing each others butts. 
Facts/Logic After the last mass school shooting, Democrats and the media were screaming for gun control because if it would save one life, it's worth it right? Well, if we could keep one illegal immigrant out to prevent the killing of one person, isn't it worth building the wall? In their mind, Mandy is not worth it. They don't care about Americans. Just keeping their power and votes they get from uneducated people who like all the free stuff they offer. 
Affiliation And electrify it. 
Humor Congratulations President, Trump for your fight to keep law and order in the Americas !! 
Facts/Logic You are the best President in the world 
Facts/Logic Spinning breaking the law as moral and any means to stop it as immoral is the liberal radical platform. . for votes. It's all about votes. 
Negative An illegal boy ,Kill my husband , certain people dont get it until God forbid it happens to them loose a person in your. Family .the pain never stop hurting never wish on no one build the wall 
Affiliation So just emmigrants commit crimes low blow #antiwall 
Positive You're a jackass.

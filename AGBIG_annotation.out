no God bless you Mr President! You the best!!!
yes Thank you President Trump
no God bless President Donald Trump
no 
yes How sad. Bless you.
no Kim Miller oh you must be ok with killing babies too
no Dante Noel   A liberal loon not supporting this "POLICY!"  Perhaps you should have studied something that would have given you a career and at the same time taught you how to properly construct a sentence!   Perhaps you could move to the Hague and sit on the UN's International Court of Justice!!! You know, the Court that caters to dictatorships and terrorist regimes, while degrading and finding fault with  democracies, especially Israel and the United States!!!  I'm sure you'd fit right in!!!!
no Antonio Acquarelli end running Congress is true overreach.  Take off your MAGAt hat and give your brain some oxygen.
yes Tragically they don't seem to care one bit.
yes I was working for an employer who had hired illegal immigrants and didn't notify the staff that had been working there. One of the younger a_ _ holes invited me out to his place for a beverage, the boss's son even said he'd be there so I thought nothing of it (we both were young and he wasn't bad looking) so I kindly accepted the offer (2nd mistake) 1st was even talking to him in the 1st place. We planned a time and he gave me the address, now keep in mind I was currently residing in a smaller town where at this younger age it didn't seem to be an issue to go to someone's place.  Upon arriving I had to go through a cattle gate, house was out in the country, upon arriving to the house, there were more guys out there than I had originally thought there would be. I then decided that MAYBE this just wasn't a good idea and I was trying to leave in my car, never had gotten outside of it. I found out that there were a couple of men outside and they had chain locked the gate closed and I NOT wanting to destruct property, demanded they open the gate. No one would open the gate, one other guy had made his way into my car and forced me over and drove me back to the house where there were 7 maybe 8 illegal immigrants and a 50+ yr old Male who MIGHT have been a U.S. resident. They dragged me into the home where they forced themselves on me, forced liquor down my throat and then proceeded to take me into a bedroom where I continued to fight them off of me, one by one they all took turns, they all were all over me and it then became a group thing, I fought and fought what seemed like hours, once everyone had their fun, I managed to crawl myself into the bathroom, near the bedroom I was in and in there the 50 yr old man put me into the shower, by know the liquor had kicked in and I was pretty much a lump on a log. So I was finished off in a shower with this horrible 50+ yr old and left alone once all were done having there fun. I yelled and screamed I kicked and clawed I threw punches I even tried to bite, by the time I came too I was naked in a cold shower and even though I was still pretty well lit, I was able to get just enough on to get myself out of the house and my keys and get in my car where I was able to then escape any future sexual assaults. I wasn't even sure if I was going to be held longer or released. I tried to file charges, but after that night all men were on the run including the older man himself. So nothing had ever come of it other than me getting counseling. BELIEVE WE HAVE TO BUILD THIS WALL TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN.  I would NEVER wish a gang bang on even my worst enemy. I have gone through counseling and I have over come my situation. I have a daughter now, and I fear that she NEVER EVER endures such a HORRIBLE HORROR.  This happened about 12 years ago, but it has only gotten worse  since then with the population of illegals.  Let's protect our future!
no Absolutely
no my president!
no Dam Melissa Lamphere, they get butthurt soooooo quick. How dare you talk about the GREAT ALMIGHTY DICTATOR!!!!!
yes Steve Martin Your an idiot and probably want socialism  ....
no We The People witnessed this week the One'n'Only Mr. Fake News manufacture a Fake Crisis that he tries to sell to us with nothing but Lies and Fake News Alternative Facts!!!
yes It will do nothing for drugs, those come through ports of entry not across a random stretch of the boarder. But again believe the propaganda you are being fed.
no If you believed in protecting people, youd be pursuing fact-based security measures and not a silly medieval wall in a time when Ladder technology is plentiful and cheap. https://www.homedepot.com/p/Werner-32-ft-Fiberglass-Extension-Ladder-with-300-lb-Load-Capacity-Type-IA-Duty-Rating-D6232-2/100664518Werner 32 ft.

yes To clarify. My "like" is for preventing more of this.
yes Families in Illinois werent protected yesterday!!! Apparently THEY  werent your priority...
yes Yeah a wall doesn't fix tunnels or airplanes must I keep going ?
no Those guarded walled in people say no this man knows why
no we do...we enforce those laws everyday
yes Kim Miller The reason why you have a problem right now is because you got a whole lot of bad people into your country that use those weapons in a bad way.  When you try to steal the power from an American what he do? He take his gun and go get back whats him.  Some law give you some power that you don't seem to appreciate
yes Trump morons...
no Thank You Mr President for Wanting to Keep Us Safe I know the Democrats Dont care because They will lose Illegal Votes but I know You Care Thank You.
yes Protection means we the people have the right to our weapons!
yes (Some died.  Ban immigrants and build a wall)
no Plus....prevent pandemic
no We need protection.....from Congress. Thank you President Trump. Don't sign the bad deal. Shut down the Gov. if you have to. Do an extension.
no How tragic.
yes Stuart Schnapp you are a dumbass German
no Thats a tragic case but if we want to stop illegal immigrantion wouldnt it be smarter to have an effective solution utilizing surveillance (like drones with thermal imaging) instead of a wall that will take forever to build and which the experts say will not be effective?
no Kris Landers we are not saying citizenship status is the reason it happened. That's not the argument. The argument is, that will proper enforcement, this person would of never been in the country, and this tragedy would of been prevented. I hope that brings clarity.
no And I had my vehicle cracked into in a parking space, causing substantial damage, by an Asian immigrant who had decided he could squeeze into it in back of me for some bizarre reason.  He spoke no English, had no idea of American rules of the road, had no insurance, and was driving a car not registered to him. Where do we put the wall to keep those like him away?
no An America killed my best friend where should we build a wall to keep out?
no Seems like a lot of stories of illegals killing or other crimes against American citizens. Why dont we have a march of all the victims and family of victims from illegal aliens. I bet it would be quite large.   That needs to be organized.
no Democrats care about the flag (keep it holy) guns (keep'em close by) God (use his name often) and acquiring money by any means. Oh yea I meant republicans
no Build that fucking wall!!!!!!!!!
no Nancy Hissa provide proof
no A USA citizen , who is white supremacist killed the daughter of another parent, but you didn't call him  a white supremacist,  how ironic.
yes Dave Thompson what are you even babbling about?
yes An illegal grown man punched my 3 yr old granddaughter in the face.  A different illegals 9 year old daughter sexually assaulted my same granddaughter when she was 5. So I am strongly supporting this wall!
yes Only if Mexico pays for it.
no How many children have been killed by Americans?
yes It is sad that Democrats have no feeling for American loss of life..  Just seem to intensely care for Latinos trying to get across the border.
yes Bill Johnson MAKE AMERICA WHITE AGAIN.... Thats what you people want.  Scared its getting too brown you
yes James Ellis great response, keyboard warrior.
no Charlesetta Brown who told you that?Ask some people living near the border!
yes Soo sorry for your loss, I agree, we need to protect our borders...,
no So very sorry for your loss. Build the wall
yes Sorry about your daughter but I'm agree with you
yes Protect Americans
yes Peter Stock Your understanding is very limited Peter, your one of the pagans of the world and a FB troll. And thanks for proving my comment how we as Trump supporters have also dodge the poisonous darts from people like you with your insults. We have battled demons like you for decades. But thanks for reading it. Hopefully some seeds will grow from it.
yes God bless you !
no The enemy is within our own country and in government - President Trump they hate you because you are putting the American citizens first, then them second. The Dems and RInos are use to being put first and the citizens get something. Thank you for standing up for the American citizens and American values.
yes And the other 99% of Americans killed were killed by legal American citizens.  So let's focus on the 1%.  That really makes sense.  SMH
yes Linda Durbin he should use the money for education because your grammar is atrocious.
yes Daniel Alexander Allen are you mentally defective? We have sovereign countries for a reason. Illegal alien means you are not supposed to be here and don't just get to waltz your way in here.
yes Those who oppose a wall are obviously hoping to support illegal activities. Search your soul. The cost is a non-issue and pennies in the dollar compared to the outrageous waste of our government.
yes Nancy Harris are you also complaining about the billions of taxpayer dollars sent to Jordan to build THEIR wall?
no Thank you Mr President. Keep up the hard work and God bless you and protect you. If you need me, call me
yes Build the Wall and build a wall around the liberals and California...
no CONS AND CRIMINALS ! Don't forget what we are dealing with
yes Any intelligent American agrees with the wall.
yes Statistically, you are more likely to be killed by an American than an illegal immigrant. That's a fact.
no 200 a day? I call BS on that. The numbers of illegals crossing are way down from a decade ago according to the immigration and security services. This is BS
no Deborah Bartlett, how is this funny?
yes How does one have a criminal past but not be deported if they did not have legal documents to stay here? This is more then just a wall. The justice system sucks and needs fixing.
no Calls a national emergency. Leaves to go play golf for two days.
no Apple Rivera Liar!
yes Lee N Kristen Wilcox instead of lashing out why don't you answer the question
yes Just saw what Apple said , DOH
yes We could protect ourselves if our government would adhere to the constitution! Whats up with 50 state ccw you talked about????
yes Temicka Brown no your democrat plantation doesn't care about you, try and keep up.
yes God blesses you Mr. President
yes Thanks  We Agree!. So sadly and Sorry for Your Lost!. MAy God Keeps Blessings you and Keeps You Stronger!. Than you can Helping other It yo Los They Love One Next!. Amen
yes ...and democrats support these illegals!  Makes me sick!!!
no Blame all these murders on the people who voted for democrats.
no Imagine if there was not a wall! What would happen? Probably, and Im just speculating here, that illegals would simply walk across and enter our country and disappear. Illegal and undocumented, and unable to find work, they would either simply exist off tax payer dollars, straining our system, or commit crimes to get money. All the while  our vets and homeless continue to suffer, living on the streets and in makeshift shelters. And sanctuary cities and states increase your taxes to provide illegals with free benefits - food, housing, medical and education while ignoring our citizens first! This is wrong. If they seriously want to better Their lives, do so legally and obey our laws. Is this what we want America to become? Is this why some support santuary cities and states?   Consider this last point. All countries across this planet use some type of a physical border, barrier or even a simple sign post to let you know that you are entering their country. They do this for many obvious reasons, one of which is to inform you that you have crossed into their sovereignty and that you must obey the laws of their land.  Same here when you think about the continental US, between states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii). Each state has boundary lines established - sign posts and in some cases check points to let you know that you are entering theyre state and that different state laws are in effect, that different state taxes may be in effect et cetera. If borders do not matter, then why would states need them, or why should their be any localized laws  of any kind in place? The reasons are obvious and our country needs a border.
no Ban guns.
yes Carl Ostendarp where are you 300 or more a day
yes HAVE YOU ACTUALLY SEEN THE NEW  WALL PARTS BUILT?
no WWG1WGA! BUILD THAT WALL! praying for all of our protection.
no Build the wall!!
yes Respectable Mr. President Jii. Thank you Mr. President for working so hard for us American Citizens. MAGA
yes Hal Eric Mitlitsky you're a moron! If it stops just one, that might be the one that would have killed your daughter or son. Stop listening to CNN
no what about all the mass shootings you have in America? Pretty sure thats not related to immigrants!!
no I would suggest that you deal with the ones you have at home first then.
yes Blanca Gonzalez very sorry ma'am! God Bless you and yours.
no Nothing against building the wall but arent they coming through underground tunnels???
yes All these mass shootings are being done American people what are you going to do about them?
no Thousands of Mexicans die with weapons that you pass through the border, please build the wall
yes Chris Halliday maybe you need to look at and speak to different people.
no Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep. Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! --Luke 6:25-26
no Danny Jones-thank you for your faith and support for President Trump and our country. Hope things will get better for your country.
no Anna Sophia Wheland Don't hold your breath. I'm still waiting for someone to explain to me why the lax gun laws cause gun violence in areas with strict gun laws, yet the problem doesn't happen in the places with the lax gun laws.
yes So sorry for your tragic loss.  Yes Pres Trump is doing the right thing.  It is unbelievable what the democratic party is doing to this country.  As long as we have Trump we have a chance to save this country.  Thank God for putting him in the White House.  It breaks my heart to think what our country will be like when my grandchildren are grown.  All grandparents need to contact their congressmen and let them know we're tired of their games and they need to do their job, support our President and protect this country.  Good vs evil.  Which side are you on?
no God Bless Trump and all his efforts to keep us safe
no Learie Jordan The opiate problem in this country was caused by our own drug companies, it's the reason for the demand for heroin. I have no problem with people owning guns, it's the perversion of the laws by the NRA lobby that prevent common sense guns laws that would help keep guns out of the hands of people that should not own them. This emergency declared by the idiot in chief is a manufactured lie. Someone show me that statistics that say that illegal immigrants kill more people than assholes with guns, over 300 mass shootings already this year. WTF! Moe-rons!
no We have criminals on the daily that are citizens including every shooter lately who happens to be a white nazi supremacist that also happens to be extreme supporters of Trump but every once in a while an immigrant commits a crime, big or small, and that's all that matters. Not the REAL crime problem of actual citizens. By no means am I supporting a killer but using it as a political boost is ridiculous.
no SO SORRY for your loss . Apparently the Dems , starting from the top , are and NEVER were for the American citizen. Their behavior is COMPLETELY ABHORRENT!
yes Eva Graham you just might want to edjamcate yourself deary
yes Democrats = Idiots
yes Didn't do much for the concert goers in Las Vegas, the students in Parkland, the people at the club in Thousand Oaks.  But you know what will save Americans?  Safe roads, better infrastructure, better technology, and a REAL President.
yes Just ask the NASCAR Driver's in Daytona this Weekend !!! Walls Definitely Work !!!
no Am so sorry for their losses. Will you please also speak up about all the innocent lives lost due to gun violence?
yes #Trump2020
no What about the natives born terrorists who kill our children and families on a daily basis?
no Pls Like Janam Tv  fB Page  American Support channel  subscribe Janam Tv youtube
no Great Britain.  Enough said.
yes Sorry excuse for a president.  Resign or be impeached!
yes Build the wall . We really need it for all of our protection. Get it done Mr President.
yes Thank you president Trump!
no #LovePOTUSTrump #Trump2020 #SiliconValley4Trump2020
no Finish the super Collider. Unlock the secrets of the universe for only 4 billion dollars. Or,.. build a big steel wall...  https://interestingengineering.com/usas-super-collider-lies-abandoned-texas-desert
yes Too bad we cant trade all these families loved ones who are killed by illegals with family members of these democratic fucks. Hopefully these democratic fuckers lose their family members to illegals. Then maybe theyll see why we need security. But I bet that AOC cunt could have her whole family raped, tortured, and killed by illegals and she would still be like being them all in!!!
yes That would be 1,886 less if they had been in their own country.
yes So much blood on the Democrats hands.  They are getting away with murder over and over and over and over,  when will it stop.
yes Nathan Berg well the thing is you can not prove it. And what your saying is a hyperbole.
yes Why cant we protect the border with thoughts and prayers? Its what we use to protect our schools...
yes So we are going to build a SOCIALIST wall?  Paid for by the people against their will?
no We  need the wall
yes why is this under 'opinion" ?
no Amen
no Fernando Haberfeld ridculo!!!!!
no Alberto Weisz   Let him open Pandora's Box. Remember, once you open Pandora's Box you can't close it.  Donald Trump. Go ahead and declare a National Emergency. One of two things will happen. Either you will lose in court. Or, the next Democratic president will declare a National Emergency for climate change, gun control, DACA, Health Care reform and middle-class tax cuts. Just to start with. 
yes Come to sweden and build a wall aswell please....
yes Walls work that's why there is no drugs and weapons in prison
yes I thought the same thing. Trump is disgusting. His supporters are sycophantic dogs.
yes Thats one up for polosi an Schumer
yes Look at the stats on how many Americans were killed by guns. It's far higher than illegal immigrants but you won't touch gun control because they fund your campaign. It's always about the money with you.
no DonaldTrumpUsaPresident.com .... made in China
no Juanita Craner but mumbers show immigration is low
no Linda Dee Montes you gun clinging morons. If you are a responsible gun owner, whats the panic?
no Danny Jones AMEN
yes #FakeTrumpEmergency  #FinishTheImpeachment #Collusion  #Obstruction
yes Was he a drug dealer or gang member?
yes He came through a tunnel and he was selling fentanyl that flew in from China.
no Trump has such a wonderful agenda to return us back to somewhat normal in resemblance of yesteryear.  Its sad he has such idiots slowing him down.  It must be frustrating.
yes Justice for Dominic Durden, Jamiel "Jas" Shaw II, Joshua Wilkerson, Ronil Singh, Sandra Duran, Kathryn Steinle, Nisa Mickens, Kayla Cuevas and all who were killed by illegal immigrant criminals. #EndSanctuaryCities #Buildthewall
no https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2132377443519082&set=p.2132377443519082&type=3&theater
yes Danny Jones  How is EU membership destroying your culture Danny? Twat
yes Yes, we ask that every time there's a mass shooting committed by a legal U.S. citizen who purchased their gun legally right here in the U.S.  smh...
yes We are praying for all those who have lost loved ones.
yes Carl am German. You are wasting your time,make most Americans understand. This is why the US is so messed up. The most crimes are coming from. AMERICAN CITIZENS.
no Build the wall!!!
yes Trump 2020. He cares about America
yes Patty Bertocchini La Puma that is one officer who would be alive if that illegal immigrant wasn't in this country to begin with
yes Build that wall!Pelosi, schummer,waters kamala,shame on them all!!!
no You mentioned that they use underground tunnel, right? Is building wall making sense?
yes Anthony Clark flint Michigan is being repaired daily. They are literally replacing every inch of piping in the city.  It is most certainly not a 1 day or 1 year project.  It is underway.
yes What about 12,000 miles of coastline anyone can boat through?
yes BabyLuis Hollywood   Mental illness.
yes A white person killed 57 ppl in Vegas , a African American kill 5 ppl in a work place yesterday , a white person killed how many students in Florida?!?!YUP BUILD THAT WALL 
yes I'm so sorry for your loss.
no Not all immigrants are committing crime Mr Honourable President arrest criminals and let the children women and men get assistance or build them a city were there can work on the American system and economy
no Illegal European immigrants killed almost all real Americans some hundred years ago. Do you all forget where you come from. That happen in a country where it is more important to learn how to shoot, then national history as a school subject.
yes If teleportation. Is to be exsplan will transmute demure save the body or. if body anadamy of a female falopeintubes can incubate life preservation geneticly Revitalize - + organisms by molecule
yes You mean the wall that we need because we have people coming over here illegally and breaking laws. Yeah sounds like a national security issue to me. Btw the Constitution also states to protect the American people which a wall does. Understand?
no Another American killed my friend. Is her death any less important than an illegal killing another American?
yes Dakota Puccio its comedy gold when you idiots lump 4 or 5 terms together that are all different, thinking youve pinpointed a group of people. 
yes Gregory Baxter More people die from illegal and prescription drugs and medical mistakes than guns in this country. You people really need to get off gun BS cause guess what Guns arent going any where. They are in our Constitution. Illegal immigration is NOT.
no President Trump is looking out for OUR SECURITY & WALLS DO WORK ! Thank you President Trump
yes Justin Fields,  Which part of making America great do you hate?
no Some people dont want to hear the truth...bet on Beto as one of them...
yes hOLLYWOOD=jEWIISH RUN COMMIE AGENDA
no it's like you guys are in a competition to be the most bigoted
yes Thank you President Trump!!
no Build the wall!  We are not trying to keep people from leaving our country, therefore we are not dealing with a Berlin Wall like situation. This needs to be finished!
yes Illegal immigration is at a 10 year low and there is no extra money going towards vets.
no WE need the Wall !!!
yes Build the wall Mr President
no Heart breaking.
yes Brown immigrants, legal or not, are not inherently dangerous. In fact, immigrants are statistically less likely to commit violent crimes than American-born citizens.   This rhetoric is dangerous & divisive.
no It is the only way to stop it
yes IDIOT! You don't have the house votes or even a legit cause to unseat her never mind impeach her.
no dEmOCrAt CoMMuNisTs!@?#!?
yes If the wall saves 1 life it will have paid for itself.
yes It's about time we impeach the people that are fight President Trump on our border security.  They must have forgotten that their duty is to the American people,  not the rights of illegals
no It's a dangerous world we live in...must keep up our guard...just as we have seen lobbyist pay off Congress and Senators...who's to say that "terrorists-monies" can't be funneled into this country to pay-off local-government officials and police...all along cloaked as just a mere..."friendly-donation"...to be the fuel that supports covert-domestic "sleeper-cells"..."scary-situation"...could or maybe taking place quietly right on our very door-steps??? Always expect the worst case scenarios...
yes WHAT ABOUT THE ONE THAT ARE HERE ?
yes Ah, stupid? trump is guilty of sedition; Pelosi is guilty of representing the majority of Americans in opposing the wall.
yes Laws against drunk driving are already in place and are enforced.  Immigration laws have become relaxed and people try to protect those who come here illegally.  Big difference in how the 2 are addressed.  Did my friend deserve to die when he was walking down the sidewalk and was struck by a female illegal immigrant and thrown 50 feet through the air and spending the next 2 weeks in the hospital before he died. The driver was sober and had no insurance and because of her status as an illegal the state's DA decided not to press charges she lives a happy life in Rockford illinois while an American family weeps.  So how will you defend something like this.  Even more so when the person that killed my friend had no legal right to even be in the country that my friend fought and served for.
yes Idiot
yes Marc Blair but you know what else doesn't work either?
no Dumb ass
no If these two had a baby together the whole thing would just be a long ass forehead
yes Sure it is. Look at the correlation of violent crimes and stricter gun laws in the US.  Then look at how many people overdose. After that, how many people die from the effects of smoking? And, how many innocent bystanders are killed as a result from driving under the influence?
no What about the Americans killed by Americans?
no Keith Webber Jr. he didnt get 8 lol
no Katie Ander I do read and you did not counter one thing I said.  You just come in with a condescending attitude.   Trump went bankrupt with so many of his companies? Yes, he has had 6 companies declare bankruptcy, pretty good considering he has over 100.   Maybe you should try doing a little research into actual data instead of looking for journalists to spoon feed you.
yes Kevin Peevey that's not how any of this works
no Just came to read the illegal killed my family member comments.
yes God Bless You Sir!!
yes WALLS KEPT MY MARRAGE ALIVE FOR ALMOST 22 YRS.
no Love this President!!!
yes great leader
yes No offense to anyone who loses a family member tragically..but 380 million people live in the country. Far more people are killed by white American citizen drunk drivers and crazy white Americans shooting up schools. Is there a 'wall' to make them feel like something is being done to make sure it doesn't happen again?
no It is disgraceful that you are using these families and their grief to further your own political gain.
no Curtis Rice Sir, youre so clever, youve blown my mind...
yes Jess Castrejn I think the point is that had he not been in the country (was here illegally) he wouldnt have killed her
yes Those laughing at this terrible story are truly sick people.
no Thank you. Im so saddened by these loss these families has experienced. Youre doing whats right Mr President.  Youre on the right side of history and thats American Patriotism
no Sorry for your loss
yes President Trump
no Hal Eric Mitlitsky if there ever will be another democratic president. All the reasons you just mentioned are reasons why there shouldn't ever be one again.
no Democrats hate President Trump more than they want to keep Americans safe. Build the wall now.
yes Denise Pinto Chenier maybe you should lose a child to one, might change your mind...
no You're disgusting for not having normal compassion for a man who lost a child. Hatefulness is the new normal for liberals it appears.
yes Build the wall. Trump cares about America and legal citizenship.
no Heard this man on Fox and Friends Sunday. Very articulate and passionate. Great spokesperson. So sorry for his loss
yes Dave Callender well if we can cancel out the law of people coming in legally these we can get rid of every law and be a lawless country ! Fine by me but will you be ok with it Santa Claus when a criminal is at your door ? Im guessing no you smart ass
yes Of course walls work, even a retard knows that! Democrats know that, too, but they just wanna oppose President's agenda every chance they get, even if it affects the country negatively and even if Americans have to die in the process! Really sad and pathetic band of traitors!
yes Emily Neal The only way to prevent the government from becoming  too powerful is our guns. TYRANNY. Protection
yes *too
no Thank you President Trump for the wall!!
no Thank you for keeping Americans safety first Mr. President
yes LMAO LMAO, Americans killed 68, 783 last year with guns... illegal immigrants killed 34 thats homiides and motor accidents included...sorry for there lost.... but this argument is a omplete joke
no Mr. President, if El Chapo" Guzmn pay for his freedom to building the wall, it will safe USA lots of money and make safe for our country with no cost to us, please think about it, Thank you for your hard work, 90% of USA citizen appreciated your hard work to make our country safe and please do not listen to the fake news, Thank you again
yes Thank-you our hearts break for your loss
yes And what did the family do.
no IF YOU KILLED AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT THE DEMS WOULD DEMONIZE U
no He agrees!
no Ruben Soriano, arent you happy Trump is golfing this weekend?
yes Dave Callender Oh thats real smart its not that accident dont happen to everyone its that They had no business being here to cause the accident not having insurance because they are illegal youre real smart
no Stephen Edwards then take your front door off where you live and see how long before you have uninvited company.
no Stay strong, build our wall, and secure our borders at all cost. Donald Trump and only Donald Trump in 2020. MAGA.
yes I bet if that was Pelosi standing there with a picture of her kid that was killed by an illegal I will bet my life the wall would be built
yes This year when you get a Tax Bill instead of a Tax Refund just remember, your hard earned money went to some Billionaire who really needed a tax break.
yes President Trump....Please build that wall.
yes Holly s...t. iam Sorry. God Bless you Trump Baby :-). Iam Wish a better world for us.
no Jeanie Railsback ever thought your building skills are less than par.
no It is normal for Human Beings to loath someone like Trump that constantly lies to them like the vast majority of Americans do!!! So why does the Trump Cult so easily accept Trump's constant lying to them??? That is very abnormal! .......though of course Cult's throughout history have always excepted this disgraceful behaviour from their false idol!!!
no You know best President Trump!! You do what you need to do!  Your base is behind you
yes How did Joel Velazquez get to the country? I can't find anything saying how or when he came here.
yes President Trump, if you are for the American people, then veto the spending bill. It has in it to abolish ICEs authority to arrest and get funding from the treasury!! Also, the $1.7 billion is for the Rio Grand if and only if the residents vote for it, just 55 miles only. No one read this bad for Americans bill before they voted on it!! Mitch McConnell lied to you, there are land mines in this bad bill!! Im tired of my money going to illegal aliens, and there is $443 billion dollars for them in it!! If you dont veto this bad bill, how can I vote for you again in good conscience and expect you to be on our side!! Ive lost my healthcare because they have taken my refund for two years, but illegals get free healthcare!! Not right!! Im almost 60 years old, and worked hard for what I have!! President Trump, you promised a wall, but not a bad spending bill!! The democrats are not for the American people, the republicans are not for the American people, but you President Trump are the only person for the American people and myself!! Please keep America safe, veto the bill and Build The Wall!! Thank you President Trump, and God bless you and your family!! God bless America!!!!
yes The news on the left will not report of this. They are full of hate for TRUMP and don't want our country to succeed they care about illegal aliens more than Americans. So sorry for your loss.GOD BLESS YOU !
no Thank you mr. President for putting America and Americans first. We stand with you 100%.
yes Joseph Nowik There is big difference between building a wall on our border and trying to revoke our rights. If you cannot see that you're a moron.
no Kris Landers and who should we blame for this? https://fox17.com/news/local/undocumented-immigrant-snuck-into-lebanon-home-raped-6-year-old-girl
no Emil Drr Really, from germany?!  How is the muslim take over under your glorious merkel going?! Asshat!
no The wall is looking better and better
yes Thank you President Trump for fighting for us. Trump 2020
yes Trump is staying relevant as the wall is the only issue he has to stand on.  Unfortunately people are biting on this.  Child poverty, inequality, high infant death rates, gun crime, corporate greed...These are the burning issues that Trump can neither fix nor wants to address.  Building a wall is easy.
no Lord Jesus is coming back soon
no Good
yes How many illegals are committing all those mass shootings we hear about weekly. Aren't they just mostly citizens with guns.....duhhhhh
yes Sorry for all the loss of lives to our people.  The illegals shouldnt have even been here....  we are just learning how corrupt many of our Congressmen/women and senators are...much of this death and dying is their fault for not upholding the laws of our land already in place..
yes Except, of course, that there is none.
yes Flint Michigan needs $167 million to fix their water problem. Why isn't this a national emergency?
yes God bless our President! We the people support our President! Build the walls!
no Personal tragedy does not equal a national crisis.
yes He has them working at his country clubs
no BUILD THE WALL
yes Apple Rivera So sorry you went through that. Enterprise should take responsibility. Hope they find him but probably not unfortunately.
yes when are people going to see that we need the wall now
yes No they should have stayed in home country.
no William Klier   How about you ask the parkland shooter families how happy they are about a wall but no gun reform
no Does anyone not think that the Democrats are corrupt and making money from groups that profit from the illegal immigrants and drug smuggling coming across the border?
yes You are a joke. You will never get your monument to stupidity.
no A American president killed my country I feel your pain
yes Don't cherry pick
yes Nancy J. Seddon liberals lack common sense. Heck now they have several that support killing full term babies and have anti-semites in their ranks.
yes I won't deny the fact that America has a gun problem, though we can't act like illegal immigration isn't an issue.  While not every immigrant is a threat to society, we cannot deny the fact some of them are, even if they're a minority. Some are even wanted criminals.  Not to mention that if Orange-man were to actually implement stricter firearm control, there would still be a lot of contraband crossing the border because of the lack of immigration control. Not just drugs, but unlicensed weapons as well.  They're basically fuel for the black market which puts unlicensed weapons in the wrong hands. this in itself is valid reason to encourage possession of a firearm to protect one's self against this threat.  I think that fixing (or at least minimizing) the contraband problem is the first step towards implementing a better, more efficient gun control project since the population will feel more secure.  Whether building a wall is the best solution is up for debate. On the surface it looks extreme, but we won't know its efficiency until it's finalized. Until then, people will have a valid argument to defend both the second amendment and the wall. Pierre-Luc Vachon
yes What about all those non illegals that murder like yesterdays shooting...how is a wall going to protect us. National emergency si gun control not trumps promised wall.
no Learie Jordan lol no one made a gun comparison?  keep em coming. This is like skeet shooting.  yeeyee
yes Please Mr. Trump, build the wall as fast & secure as you can. Lives depend on it!
yes So   Sorry
no Judy Mike Hare
yes Wendi DelValle if a white guy wouldve done the same thing, would you be wanting to banish white dudes from the country? Sorry for the loss of your brother.
yes Can use my tax money to help build a wall
no My husband worked the boarder during his 22 years in the military & the horror stories he can tell. Thank you President Trump for protecting our country. We welcome anyone who wants to come LEGALLY!!!
yes A illegal shot my 17 year old niece in the face.  If you think it won't happen to you or one of your loved ones, THINK AGAIN.
yes Thank you President Trump for working so hard for American citizens first! The democrats know walls work they just want to resist anything you want. Keep up the great work!
yes M......f......ers!
yes Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
yes Apple Rivera if this story is even true, which I doubt, because Enterprise would have told you that whoever they rented that truck to is responsible for any loss or damage incurred by that truck.  You did get the licence plate from the truck, didn't you?    And guess what ijit, if you rent a truck from Enterprise, a car from Hertz, etc, and you let anyone drive it that is not on the contract YOU signed, your butt is responsible.
yes Why do liberals in Hollywood have walls around their homes?
no How did that illegal get here?
yes Curtis Rice would not make it back in the country then.....
yes George Brakey when is cult 45 going to wake up and realize we need sensible gun reform?
no The war on drugs..terror..illegal immigration...mental health...better health care...the list is endless...The President  has centries of political bandaids to peal off..what a mess.
yes And even if he gets 8 billion that won't build the wall that's just a start dumb ass he will have to come up with 25-67 billion to build the wall. So have another beer moron. I'm sure the last 3 brain cells are starting to sober up
yes So sorry for your loss and everyones loss because of the invasion of illegals.  Every country on the face of the Earth requires foreigners to visit them legally.  It is insane liberal bullshit that has prevented us from securing the border. Trump has done what no president has done before.  He has taken his job seriously.....
no David Crteur
yes Stand firm, Mr. President! You're doing a great job for ALL Americans! 
yes According to Jim Acosta the person is allegedly an illegal immigrant.
yes Gato Gato dont forget drugs gangs cartel human trafficking. Not just killings
yes Promises made must be kept, allocate 20billiom for the wall and complete it within a year, NO Compromise!
no The only thing he cares about is his EGO! he really dont give a crap about you or your family look at the USA debt he got us in. 22 Trillion.
yes Linda Gurtz Hildreth do you really think her tax records are for real?
yes Kim Lamphier just because I don't think everything you said should happen doesn't mean I support the mass shooters. Do you even understand how dumb that statement sounds?
no Steven J. Champlin once the wall is built, the crime rate and illegal crossings and human/drug trafficking will diminish. Won't eliminate it but will diminish.
yes I could see dad tearing them a new one trying to cross
no Build the wall.
yes LET S BUILT
yes The Wall is a figment and an fixation of Trump's sick twisted narcissistic mind! Mr. President!! Get help!!
yes That statistic is for LEGAL immigrants, my wife being one  100 US citizens are the victims of violent crime at the hands of illegals every day  If one of your loved ones was a victim, perhaps you would reconsider your position
yes I bet all them study's where by lying Democrats
yes Theresa Boyd these statistics are absolutely shocking, yet people don't think there is a crisis? It's unbelievable that people hate the President more than they care about the safety of pur citizens. These are the FACTS that can't be refuted. Thank you for sharing this. It reaffirms what I already knew. Build the Wall!
yes Merriam Webster , Wall 1a : a high thick masonry structure forming a long rampart or an enclosure chiefly for defense often used in plural
yes Charlesetta Brown r u crazy one crime ? Open yoyr eyes . There is crime by the hour from these illegals. Not to mention these drugs are kids are getting from them. You people need to wake up
yes Sharon Fantana here's a simple one for you take your front door off take your back door off you'll be safe.
yes Don't sign that Bill! It expands our already broken immigration system!
no I so agree with the wall. I am tired of the demos saying that he American people don't want the wall. how dare they speak for the majority of the people who are all in for the wall. demos don't  answer for me. build the wall. trump 2020
yes It only matters to regressives if it personally affects them. Then they say everyobe else lacks empathy
yes Hopefully VietNam too
no 0 build the wall that's all there is to it
yes the lawmakers who are opposed to the wall don't give a damn about American families
yes Killed one of my cousins friend right in front t of him sorry fir your loss!
yes Keith Webber Jr. Trump used them as a prop.  Where were Parkland parents?
no Rose Mary O  nope they generally end up dead which is nice but if not the get life not one of the last 20 shootings did any of them get to plead insanity they either got life with no parole or were dead at the scene
yes Deborah Bartlett  yes.... Mexico is a level 2 same as Germany, Italy, and Antarctica.   However, Mexico has more murders than all the other countries in the world combined!  Its more danger than a level 2!
yes The Wall Has To Get Done Protect The American People Stand With Our Great President Trump God Bless All
no MANDATORY E-VERIFY!!!!! MANDATORY E-VERIFY !!!!!!!!!!!!  https://www.facebook.com/DMLNewsApp/videos/344302992850242/
no Ok just to educate you, and show you that danny the blue nose doesn't know what he is talking about. The uk has a budget of 18 billion gbp for the EU, we get 5 billion gbp back as an immediate rebate and another 4 billion gbp to spend on public services therefore the net contribution is about 9 billion gbp. Replied back soon enough for you twat
no Curtis Rice thats not how statistics work
no Kimberly Ortiz yes with Lego Stones in Oval Office.
no Ed Ward duh does the word undocumented mean anything to you?
no Wooow  if we all thought The same as the world would  be
no Thank you a 1000 times. And the rest of my life, thank you Donal Trump.
yes Build That Wall Mr President !!!! Time to take border secruity to a next level of wall protection..
yes I wish the POTUS would share on national fake news the previous dem president's speeches which call for border protection and immigration reform. I know Clinton made a speech on this during one of his state of the union addresses.
no 4000+ Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants (that we know about)!
no So sad! What a beautiful young lady!
yes Let me guess,demo.
yes Jack Burton you are a moron.
no Remember the Democrats talking point. It's only a few Americans that get killed ,and that is OK
yes My cousin was hit by illegal, no insurance, half blind and unable to work for months. Only her insurance pay for about $30,000 and end paying all bills until now... to make it worst she is suffering  a visual damage for life.
no Stephen Mattison how on earth can you compare a job in a steel factory with a job ... were you need to commit mass murder..  Propaganda? The only person I see is a leader of the free world. Nothing more, nothing less Beyond understanding.
yes Nearly 40,000 people had died from guns last year  just saying Who are you going to go after in this big  one
no R.I.P....()....
yes Can moms of children murdered by guns be called "Angel Moms", or is this just a soundbite for the wall you aren't getting? Did you copyright the soundbite?  lol
yes Lynn Limauro Floyd sorry for your loss, but there are white kids shooting up your schools and killing a lot of innocent children the whites have been killing and raping since you set foot on American soil. No one did anything to you.  Building a wall will not protect you from danger.  Zimmerman killed a young boy and got away with murder.  Who feels sorry for his parents. They received no justice. The Native Americans were massacred and given smallpox and had their land taken away.  What about them.  As soon as you white people loose someone to any race but your own you want to act uo, save it.  You are no better than anybody else.
no Make America Safe Again!!  This President cares about America and it's people!!
yes lol Mexico isnt paying  Americans tax money is paying for the wall
yes We need Wall President Trump
yes President Trump please build the wall. Stop the alien invasion & secure America.
yes So now he supports 45? Last year he told 45 to stop using his daughter as excuse to be a shitty person. SMH all you ignorant asses kiss my round black ass. What do we build for all the white boys shooting up schools and bars? More privileged institutions to continue to protect their futures? Keep Amerikkka great.
no Michael Thompson you mean places that are surrounded by states with extremely lax gun laws ?
no Kris Landers This is so you here idiot! https://youtu.be/wDYNVH0U3cs
no Sorry. The deaths of Americans is not important enough for the Demonuts to agree to a wall.
no I feel more radars and imigration agents will be better then a stupid wall. Since he seems to want Hispanics out.
yes Albert J Destefanis I prefer to think of it more as sewer than a swamp. Sewage goes out a Democrat and after going through the sewage treatment plant comes back a Republican.
no Decline or not it's still a problem and it would help continue the decline allowing for focus to be driven elsewhere to further decline illegal immigration.
yes Sharon Et Trina Bratley  American drunk drivers get let off too !
yes Thank you Mr. President, sent here by God to serve as our president, for diverting money into a wall and completely ignoring the global crisis of climate change, so when millions are displaced by rising sea levels, the wall will protect us!
yes Build the wall!!!!!!!
no Build that wall
no Yes we must!
yes And no one has killed an illegal immigrant in the US
yes Kim Miller fucktard
no Well that and he endorsed Hillary for President !!    MAGA
yes If it ain't guns they will use bombs go educate yourself. These gun laws don't work for criminals dumb ass
yes Gregory Baxter look whos calling who a moron, you cant even spell.
no Build the wall
yes 100% supporting him
no A us citizen killed my father.should we ban them?
yes I guess it would be to much to ask Baby Killers to have sympathy for angel families and people who have died from drugs that have come across the border, sad....
yes Jeanie Railsback and the democrats want to expand government health care to the whole country. SMH
no Christine, Thank God, atlas the so called the oldest democracy have realised to protect its own people, after committing genocide, grab land and resources of native American tribes. Hopefully, your great President will protect native American sincerely now unlike scolding Elizabeth Warren!
yes Justin Fields you are an idiot!
yes What about the many who saved
no Jeremy Harbolt  https://www.facebook.com/dave.reiser.9/videos/10213329614251019/
yes Lisa Mann No all the surveillance won't be as effective. And no they won't find a way to get over or under with the right wall. Ex.. Isreal has a wall that is 99.9% effective. We need that.
no Marianne Duboy but he wont talk about the fact thats hundreds of americans are killing thousands of americans every year because there is no gun control. aaaah those americans
yes Build that wall President Trump! #TRUMP2020
yes #FINISHtheWALL  #TRUMP2020 #AMERICA1st
yes And what about all the Americans that kill each other? How about putting that percentage out there?
yes "Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open." Well said.
yes Lots of parents children die from gun violence. So lets eliminate all the guns!   Oh wait let me guess bad guys will still get guns? Just like bad guys will go through tunnels into our country or come here on expired visas?   But yes lets jack up our taxes for something that wont work.
yes Terry G. Taylor That would be a great step in the right direction.  Also,  fine employers that hire illegal aliens knowingly.
yes They are attacking the followers of Juan Guido in Venezuela the regimen of Maduro https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10217092818249013&id=1125415212
yes Renieri Ortiz , and that is proof that we need to defend our country.  Look what our ancestors did to the Indians
no Jeanie Railsback, I lost my husband too, and he also died here at home. He was a Veteran from Vietnam era and evidently the VA got his records mixed up with someone that served in Afghanistan. He didn't believe me when I told him that I didn't think that the VA Hospital was really trying to help him until about a month or so before he passed away. We didn't have insurance either because we couldn't afford it and be able to live day to day.    To many foreign doctors working there with their own agendas. I don't believe that they have the lives of our Veterans and their families as top priority for surviving.    The Democrats always thought that the WALL should be built until Trump promised to see that one actually would be built. I think that a feasiblity study should have been done as to what the WALL should be built out of etcetera and how to use technology to help with patrolling and monitoring the border before doing a slapdash project.
yes This is bullshit how many American have killed Mexicans
yes A wall wont help.
yes THIS GUY IS A BUM AND EVERYONE WHO SUPPORTS HIM
yes https://youtu.be/HomWHn-gN38
no Americans want the wall.
yes Mark Desautels Jr. Because only Congress appropriates funds. Trump is taking funds for other designations and plans to use those moneys for his wall. Understand?
no Very sad! We need the wall built!!!!
yes So sorry this got to stop!!!!!  Just one getting killed by illegal is to many ? I feel for you.... Trump 2020
yes And what about the mass shooting yesterday is that ok
no I love that you put the SAFETY and the SECURITY of our nation first. Unlike many elected officials in Congress. When do we start outlawing the funding by Soros for all these hate groups?
yes Charlesetta Brown one ? Ummm...ya may wanna check your facts
yes John N Karen Morris I think you can call about Jess Castrejn and Sofiane Hamouda lol
no Make America Great! Trump 2020! Build the wall!
yes Keep fighting we are counting on you!
yes If one death justifies 25b spend.....what do the 39 000 annual gun related deaths justify?
no He is the swamp
no And you are living in the stolen land, hey maybe you should start a new movement in the country, and help give it back, by leaving!!!
no Thank you Mr President for working so hard for us American citizens!
no picture says it all
yes A yt male killed my son
yes A wall won't bring your relative back. It will just waste your tax dollars.
no Can I just get my tax money back that you stole let the family deal with their own problem they arent worried about who killed my family member
yes Joseph Nowik , unfortunately that wont happen in the future. The use of a National Emergency to eliminate the 2nd amendment wont happen. Only a fool would try. Global warming seems to be an American thing. The major contributor countrys havent done a thing to deal with it. Healthcare isnt a right. Simply put if a person wants insurance they can buy it. Wether or not they can afford to use it is a different issue.
yes How about we get rid of the welfare magnet?
yes Distractions   #LockHimUp
yes So sorry for your loss
yes Screw the liberal obstructionist anti-American communist slime, Bunch of terrorists !
no I'm reporting John n Karen Morris on suspicion of being in the US illegally. Is that one or two of you?
yes Austin Baker hes using the death to push for his border wall which he INCLUDES in the headline.   EXCEPT a wall will do nothing for illegal immigration. They overstay their visas or come in with forged documents. The ACTUAL drugs and crime come through vehicles through legal ports of entry.   Hes not asking you to pay for immigration suppression but an entire waste of money thats more symbolic of America than it is an effective tools
yes What's going to keep us safe from US Citizens who are felons and shouldn't own guns in the first place but the background check failed?
no Amen build the wall ,it's a more safe way for Americans
no Thank you for putting our lives and safety first!  We have worked hard for our freedom! Dont let our country be destroyed by evil and hate  MAGA - God bless our President Trump! Thank you - totally support the wall
no Best president ever! #maga
yes Just as I do not understand the level of stupidity in people that think it is necessary.
no Fools Abound!
yes So sad that people just don't care others build the wall
yes Robert Dahlquist wrong. Obama did not separate children. This is a trump manufactured catastrophe because trump's not processing asylum seekers humanely.
yes How about we let the parents decide the punishment I would vote for that along with zero benefits Ive been self employed all my life been thru some hard times was told sorry but your not entitled to benefits so you stop the damn freebies Ill bet that would pretty much stop the flow of illegals if me as a citizen of this country cant receive  any assistance than a non citizen sure as hell shouldnt
yes The fucking wall should have been done by now, the last several president were lame and didn't do much for our country. President Donald J. Trump will finish the wall in spite of all the obstruction from these deadbeat liberals. And he didn't say he started it you idiot, open your eyes and ears. The wall was started many years ago and each president has promised to do something but they just take the money run. If you don't listen to what is going on and research for yourself don't criticize anyone else.
no Trump has been accused of raping teen-age daughters, so what should be done with him?
yes FOUR AND OUT!
yes Scott Hunter He could have done the political correct! Put the gun to his head?
yes So sorry about your daughter,  had the politicians been doing their job in securing our country, that criminal would not have been able to do this. We share your sorrow and grief. I have 3 daughters and one lives in California and I am always concerned and worried.  I certainly hope that President Trump is successful in getting it done for the sake of everyone who is a law abiding citizen. We wholeheartedly and strongly support the wall to stop the criminality, the illegal crossings and the madness.
yes Alberto Weisz are you stupid ,its winter it will be too cold.
yes Danny Jones. Yes sir. I dont like say it. Now all Europe countries are invasion by millions of millions migrants every year. 99% are Muslim. Welfare. Medical. Housing. School. You taxpayers pay for them because Europe socialism give freebies to destroy culture. Look at German. French. Paris. Italy. Sweden. Spain. So many Europe countries are destroying by millions of millions migrants each year in Europe.
yes His wife is a tranny named Michael LaVaughn Robinson & Barry knew it cuz He's gay
yes An American citizen murdered over 20 elementary school children.
yes BUILD THE WALL!
no Orange man bad!!!
yes Yes yes yes yes a thousand times yes!!!!!! We have your back!!!
no As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
yes Jess Castrejn has that not been addressed? Their are laws against drinking and driving already.
yes This is so important!  I have five grandchildren, their safety and the safety of this country are critical, it must happen!
yes Donna Hemenway the hell up stupid
no The wall is one thing he is working on not the only one. We needed this wall long before now for a lot of reasons.
no GET 9/11 REINVESTIGATED NOW!!!! ISrael is not your friend. Backstabbers! ZIonism=whabbism same tribe.
no Renee Ladd Magee No it is because the vast majority of the American people recognise that Trump is America's number one Enemy of the State and number one threat to National Security. Trump is the Real True Enemy Of The People and everybody knows it except the Trump Cult!!!
no Eva Graham That is laughable Eva. Trump needs impeaching.
no They are spending $192 MILLION for a facility for illegals.  This is outrages.  Send them home!
yes Stop the underground roads/tunnels that are secretly invading out country. Caterpillar equipment is building the underground. Stop it!!!
yes dems voted for money to other countries , for their walls; so they must think those walls would work(and they are) but walls for our country are immoral and wont work??? LYing democrats
yes then those countries need to address the fact huh?
no http://myupsc.com/important-study-notes-for-competitive-exams/
no 150B bullets against a group that can't figure out which bathroom to go too. I give up...
yes One killed my Uncle too the insanity needs to stop
yes Brian Roy
no That's so sad ...sorry for your loss . This should have  NEVER HAPPENED
yes ............I  HAVE   NOT  KNOW  THE  LONG  DETAIL  ABOUT  THAT..................
yes I like you man
no Truth.... https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jan/23/roughly-80-of-all-voters-say-us-needs-secure-borde/?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=facebook&utm_source=socialnetwork
yes Make a deal with President Trump! I'm sure the United States can make the deal help the United Kingdom too. That's a great thing about being friends.
yes If illegal immigrants are so dangerous why does he employ them at all his Trump properties?! The man lies to your face (every single day) and you love him, that would make you a sucker... 
yes No emergency, for sure. But it turns out the BIGGEST legal weakness in Trumps defense is that NONE of the federal laws his so-called emergency declaration triggers actually authorizes constructing even one mile of his wall! Guess he didnt get around to reading the statutes!
yes What a horrible shame! And the taxpayers are saddled with paying for ALL the illegals living expenses! When is this going to end?!
yes he shouldn't have signed that deal
no Janice Beecher I dont care what they voted against. They contribute to the insecurity of our borders every time they vote against the wall or any other security measures. Politicians should be held accountable for their stupidity and selfishness
no If it was your family member that died, you may feel differently about it.
yes Yes build the Wall.   My condolences
yes He is totally right, we need a border wall just like many other countries
yes A guy came from Indiana to Sebring, Florida and shot and killed five woman.  We should build a wall to keep people from Indiana out of Florida
yes Am so sorry for your loss.......
yes And white American men have killed a MUCH larger number of Americans, but you don't see any mention of guns being a national emergency,  or nazis or white supremacists...
no Resign
yes Good Weekend
yes Where are all the school shooting, church shooting, movie theater shooting, Vegas shooting, sandy hook shooting, and the rest of the shooting victims sitting at your rallies, your press conferences- or is it because Nazis are still good people in your opinion?
no Bill you r nuts this is the WORST president ever liar, unfaithful, gross, vulgar, crazy, giving our country to Russia 4 money friend to communist leaders, ignorant etc,. Etc. Etc. I hope he keeps eating hambuegers ans fries 4 a good ealth
yes Are Pelosi, Schumer others in Congress so cold hearted that they can't feel this pain of lives shattered?
yes Yes, and there are many, many sad stories just like his.  It has to stop!
no Not one comment about those foreheads...
yes whats that got to do with legal or illegal immigration?
no Arent you on vacation... AGAIN? WORK ON THE WEIGHT TUBBY. Your waistline is getting as big as your lies

yes Maida Broadbent Williams Go get some new batteries for your vibrator.
yes Thank you for fighting for us every day!
yes Build the wall from sea to sea.
yes Thank you so much Mr.President.  I apologize for the liberal morons that are so very horrible to you even after you do everything in your power to protect them and their families.  There is something seriously wrong with them.  But they do not represent the hard working self sufficient families in this country and the rest of us are ecstatic that there is FINALLY a leader that "gets it"
no Build the American security wall !!  Trump 2020
yes Felicia Peden Hill    Youre misinformed because youre watching Fake News CNN.
no I support the wall
yes Donna Davis you laugh at a parents loss?
yes The Rio Grande river is too long for a fence on rancher lands. There ARE some walls around cities on the river...so make them stronger.
no George E Simpkins Jr actually there were 323 mass shootings since trumps presidency.
no Pamela Evans Wahler  I totally agree!  Dems were on board under Obama....Whats changed....They just dont want another Campaign promise fulfilled by Trump.
no Build it now
no Ron O'Hearn youre back, thank goodness! Hail Trump, am I right?
yes Absolutely....
yes GO TRUMP !!
no Lloyd Blackband London England
yes Robert you're smart.
yes Thats true.
yes What happened to our tax returns?
yes Thank you for sticking your neck out to keep us safe!  Keep up the great work!
yes Thats his business
yes Finish the wall Mr President
yes Srinivas Ch if Trump will win all he doing ,and com back in 2020 what will you say then ? Will you need to study this history closer and what ever he say he will do he have done many and will do much more Trust God !
no Jrg Sudharson Vimala they ill take care of their issues....y u guys want to intrude in some one's country....can u open ur doors for  unknown humans???
yes Sue Carol
yes Javoris JV Dubose I have to disagree with you I'm not sure what you're doing wrong is everybody in New York is getting a higher refund and last year. So you better find a new accountant even with New York high tax rate we are winning. Maybe you don't pay taxes I don't know why you post this
no The wall is being built. keep going
yes BUILD THAT WALL MR. PRESIDENT
no Thank you for protecting Americans!
yes Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin 10) Combating Opioids  ~Chaired meeting the 73rd General Session of the United Nations discussing the worldwide drug problem with international leaders.  ~Initiative to Stop Opioid Abuse and Reduce Drug Supply and Demand, introducing new measures to keep dangerous drugs out of our communities.  ~$6 billion in new funding to fight the opioid epidemic.  ~DEA conducted a surge in April 2018 that arrested 28 medical professions and revoked 147 registrations for prescribing too many opioids.  ~Brought the Prescribed to Death memorial to Presidents Park near the White House, helping raise awareness about the human toll of the opioid crisis.  ~Helped reduce high-dose opioid prescriptions by 16 percent in 2017.  ~Opioid Summit on the administration-wide efforts to combat the opioid crisis.  ~Launched a national public awareness campaign about the dangers of opioid addiction.  ~Created a Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis which recommended a number of pathways to tackle the opioid crisis.  ~Led two National Prescription Drug Take Back Days in 2017 and 2018, collecting a record number of expired and unneeded prescription drugs each time.  ~$485 million targeted grants in FY 2017 to help areas hit hardest by the opioid crisis.  ~Signed INTERDICT Act, strengthening efforts to detect and intercept synthetic opioids before they reach our communities.  ~DOJ secured its first-ever indictments against Chinese fentanyl manufacturers.

no John N Karen Morris they need to add another # for deaf folks to contact them via cellphone
yes And that millionaire could of got anything he wanted
yes Yes they do!!! Build that wall Mr. President
yes And a wall would have stopped him.... right.
yes Please build the wall ASAP! https://www.facebook.com/72447968144/posts/10156780417403145/
no Proof is, drugs are easily being carried over our boarder, and that same route they use for human trafficking. Whoever wants more proof than what has been provided are the naive ones who overlook the problem because they just plainly hate  President Trump and want an open boarder society.
no Jeanne Lumadue excellent comparison
yes Worked the border for 4 years, got shot at and could not fire back. The taxpayers paid the national guard a fortune to do absolutely nothing but be a pair of eyes. Border patrol gets sniped at quite often and sometimes killed. Is this what we all really want? If you dont want the wall go down there and see for yourself what it's like. You ever heard of the creative use of a chainsaw to cut a live human apart? You tube it. They arent all bad but which ones are? You willing to take that chance? I sure as hell am not. I see both sides of the argument but we should not take chances with the valuable human beings that we are trying to protect.
yes Michael Thompson Let's compare.  I'll let you look up the number of people actually dead from far right shootings/stabbings in teh US vs from undocumented shootings/stabbings in the US just during trump's term to date.  I know you wouldn;t believe the facts if I looked them up for you; but I can give you a hint: the far right victims are higher...
yes Good John.. now call them up and tell them that Mr Trump's BILDERBERG GROUP terrorist organization is  bringing another herd of their slaves to their SOB Grand Masonic lodges..
no Thanks you mr president  chuk de fatte ...u are working very hard for us American  citizens  God bless you
no When are you going to pay the people your stealing land from?
no That's Right!
yes Larry Lubiner next get rid of the ones that over stay visa , hap  to start somewhere
no Silvia Serra Lobo   You need to understand what Danny means by the EU destroying his culture!!!  It's what President Trump and us Trump supporters want to stop from happening here!!!!   FACT CHECK THAT!!!!!
no How can people just not view west coast drug crime and neverending homeless people with drug psychosis as a direct relation with that border
yes Thank you, President Trump!
yes How many American citizens kill each other? Far more than illegals do.
no Build the wall Mr President!
no MaLinda Venatta Pearl Brown Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR
no John Garrison TDS blinds most people of common sense is why! Example,,,who in there right mind would be against border security? Isn't it funny how all these Dems today that say a border barrier or wall is immoral voted for such barriers just a few short years ago but now are against it? Dems don't have a plan to beat Trump's accomplishments  is why there( ALL IN) on not seeing him secure our border! A loss to Trump is a win for them! It's fucking sad too because we the people get hurt in Dems quest for power back going into 2020 elections! Dems are their own worst enemy! They have also brought out the worst in AMERICANS too !
yes Joseph Roy  aaaaaa let see ,a door. Is trumpty  building a door now, a big black  bigly vanity door?  I am  sure Joe  if you wanted to you could break  my door down soooooo I  guess that wouldn't  stop you honey! Again 2019 what is wrong  with modern technology  instead of a bigly trumpty  vanity wall that Mexico isn't  paying for . Answer?
no Protect us President Trump.  No one else seems to care about us.
yes hey scumbag you and your friends can write off your private jets but teachers can't write off a globe for their classroom you're an asshole
yes Gregory Baxter Are you suggesting men aren't killed by the guns in America?
yes BUILD THAT WALL, MR. PRESIDENT!!!
no Build the damn wall.
yes By all means ignore facts showing they commit crimes less often than citizens.  Moron.
yes Good that you don't have 5 billions
no "An illegal immigrant killed someone I love! While 3 people in my community were killed by natural born citizens. But I only care about what directly affects me. So let's focus on the immigrant".  Conservative logic behind the wall. 
yes I have a child. I would support anything that is going to make our society safe for us all. End illegal immigration and build walls. Support Angel moms. MAGA 2020.
no @nancypelosi.  No I dont know if its her just trying it
no What is astounding is how the Democrats ignore your stories and will not go to the wall to listen to the brave men and women who have to defend it.
no Sherry Holcomb fix them all don't put all your eggs in 1 basket
no Notice how he was asking for 21 billion to build the entire wall but only got 1.3 billion from the democrats so he declared a national emergency allocating 8 more billion but everyone is telling him to use El Chapos 14 billion? 14+8+1.3=23.3 billion to build the entire wall. I think trump just got his money to build the wall.
no Robert Dahlquist You did not read the article. Its about how just being an illegal immigrant caused someone to die. Alcohol is mentioned (unknown where it came from), mentioned of out on bail for some assault( once again does not say from where) but does keep saying about immigration status, takes a potshot at cities that do not hand illegal immigrants over to ice (not police job btw).
yes Arturo Rosales ask the Democrats.  Since the large majority of mass shootings arw done by them!!
yes My sincere sympathy goes to the father who lost his daughter by an illegal immigrant and to the angel moms and dads. Our congress men and women need to hear them instead of ignoring them.
no Apowerfulmen,change the world forever
yes Kyle Callender UNFORTUNATELY MEXICAN MEN 1 MAN COMES FOR ASYLUM GETS IT. HE BRINGS ALL ILLEGAL FAMILY ACROSS BORDER THEY GO GET FOOD STAMPS MEDICAID ETC.....THEY DONT BOTHER LEARNING ENGLISH BECAUSE PPL OF EL PASO CATER TO THEM BUT WE AMERICANS GET DISCRIMINATED FOR NOT KNOWING SPANISH.

ILL AGREE TO DISAGREE IM NOT TRYNA ARGUE I STICK TO FACTS N TRUTH.......YOUR HEART IS N RIGHT SPOT BUT AMERICANS 1ST!!!
no Hal Eric Mitlitsky I guess it will all be left up to the Supreme Court.
yes God bless President Trump,  America first
no Rob Egerton  So we are just supposed to add to the problem with doing nothing about the southern border?? Your whatisms don't work here!
yes Oh that really sad
yes President Trump, I am a native Californian.  I want a border wall.  Everyone I know, wants a border wall. Everyone THEY know, wants a border wall.  Legal immigrants WANT A BORDER WALL. #GavinNewsom #NancyPelosi are LYING to you and the AMERICAN/CALIFORNIA PEOPLE, as are many of the politicians in California.  They are making crazy rules and the people are paying the price.  Something must be done and California politicians MUST be taught a lesson.  #DonaldTrump #DonaldJTrump #PresidentTrump #buildthewall #California
no I STAND WITH YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUILD THE WALL!!  You have all these people across the United States protesting against Trump , we need people that are for Trump to STAND UP and  defend our rights.
no Cherry picked outlier data is not a great basis for running a government.
yes FINISH THE WALL WITH ELECTRIC THROUGH IT FOR SURE AND THE BEST DETECTORS  THAT IS MADE IN AMERICA ALL THE MATERIALS SHOULD BE. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THE BESTLEADER NOT ONLY IN AMERICA AND COUNTRIES AROUD THE WORLD ADMIRE YOU SIR AND PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ARE WAKING UP. I WISH ALL AMERICANS WILL DO THE SAME WAY.
no Mueller IS draining the swamp

yes A American kill my  Mother

yes Lee N Kristen Wilcox so no facts just name calling?  Ok good for you
yes Do u know what pee me off is good american people like wendi that has lost a someome and  and people like Nancy Pelosi and some of these other dems won't even give them the time of day to talk to him they just brush him off and say the heck with them
no This country is not going  to look like ours any more.  I took my sister to the emergency room 10:00 p m. one night and most all of the people there were Hispanic.  No one was speaking English.  They brought in food which smelled the emergency room up and talked on their phones some with the speakers on.  More than  likely had no insurance.
no Dont sign the bill!!!!
no yes we must  this stuff has been going on way too long..
no And people still not happy!
no Emil Dorr, there's not going to be a wall. Also there is nothing wrong with Ron Gagnon IQ. I understood him.
no So sad , something must be done! Build  that  wall.
no How stupid have we become as a people to not even defend our borders, we deserve whats coming.
yes dumoratts COULD CARE LESS ABOUT DEAD AMERICAN CITIZENS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
no O its getting built dems
yes Trump.
no Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin 6) Deregulation ~ *( tax cuts and deregulation is why the economy is doing so well)   ~Achieved massive deregulation at a rapid pace, completing 22 deregulatory actions to every one regulatory action during his first year in office.  ~Signed legislation to roll back costly and harmful provisions of Dodd-Frank, providing relief to credit unions, and community and regional banks.  ~Federal agencies achieved more than $8 billion in lifetime net regulatory cost savings. Rolled back Obamas burdensome Waters of the U.S. rule.  ~Used the Congressional Review Act to repeal regulations more times than in history.
yes How many white Americans kill white Americans. Oh  forgot  School shooting  That's AMERICA  for you  Glad to live in  CANADA  Where we're all mixed
yes Ya my tax dollars going for a wall thats not going to stop them
yes So what about the families impacted by mass shootings? Or those who lost loved ones because of inability to afford life-saving medications?
yes Trumps days are numbered.
yes The flipping wall will do nothing.
no http://www.ojjpac.org/memorial.asp
yes They might work built around you & yr crime fam. Let's start there and see.... QUIT USING THE TRAGEDY OF SOME FAMILIES WHILE YOU CAUSE TRAGEDY TO OTHER FAMILIES IN YOUR FOOLS GAME - #SOULESSTRUMP
no Tommy Carpenter money .
yes Yes president Trump build that wall. Dont back down.
yes Obviously a big percentage of our Americans WANT the drugs! You really think the drug addicts in American wont find other ways or do worse stuff to get it here! How can anyone think trump is doing right hes WRONG! Weve never had so many bad things happen like we do since hes been president!! #ImpeachTrump use the wall funding for children with cancer or homeless/jobless people. Fucking bullshit!!
no How many voters are in the US? Over 250,000,000. What is mr.Trump claimed approval rating? 52%. If everyone who approves is giving $50, tata, wall is built. Show your real support to mr.trump.
no Donna Conley Why??? Explain it the World. Because World read also your naive Bullshit  Stay in your Trailor Park Drink Beer play with Weapons and be quite
yes So f*** it that makes it okay just that everybody shoot each other let's go come across illegally.
no Melanie Fuller Pearl Brown Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR
no Unfortunately, there are not just a very few deaths caused by illegal aliens and most people only hear about a few.  This site details a lot of them but is by no means complete; there are many that have not been submitted. No....walls do not bring people back but they do provide security and safety.  Just look at the fences people put around their properties, the walls around the gated communities and homes of the elites.  They are there to keep people who do not belong there out.....plain and simple.  Talk to the families who have lost loved ones.  I personally know such a family.  Talk to the people who have been working the borders......they know more than anyone how much we need the wall, but it seems that people who are nowhere close to those borders and dont know what goes on at them, think that they know better.  http://www.ojjpac.org/memorial.asp
no build the wall trump 2020
yes Love it baby build that Wall https://youtu.be/tlfOPvUABnw
no Sad
no For years this can was kicked down the road and nothing was done. Still more nothing done before, during and after the shutdown. Within 24 hours of the emergency, at least one lawsuit and a committee was formed to investigate. Maybe if these morons worked as swiftly and with such vigor to solve the problem compared obstructing Trump we would be far better off.
yes Shameful.exploitation of family pain. Now multiply that pain by the hundreds that have been killed in mass shootings by white males. Guess we should expell all young white males for these terrible crimes. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
no Nearly killed my son w/Meth & Heroin, laced with Fentanyl, being sold to him by local Hondurans, here in CO. as he told me later. MAD as HELL! #stopthedrugs & #buildthewall !
no So what makes you think a damn wall will keep out illegals?
no TRUMP TRAIN ALL ABOARD!CHOO!CHOO!2020AMEN! FINALLY A REAL PRESIDENT!
yes So it is a competition?! One is not as bad as the other?! It matters when some son-of-a-bitch guns you down?! What an asshat! What part of ILLEGAL ALIEN border jumper, who is not supposed to be here to begin with, do you not get?! As in if the illegals were not here they could not kill anyone you mental midget!
yes <3 God bless Angel Moms (& Dads)! <3
yes Sergio Simone  Because a convicted murder, shouldnt be allowed to come in,
yes Jeanie Railsback  sounds like the doctor was the issue! Not the world
no Seven percent of the illegals crossing our southern border end up in our prison's.  We don't need to import more problems !
yes https://wokesloth.com/trump-gets-roasted-for-declaring-national-emergency-and-immediately-going-golfing/stefan/?utm_content=buffer5461c&utm_medium=facebook&utm_source=thegoodlordabove&utm_campaign=bloomjoy
yes Yes he's RIGHT IF WE DON'T GET IT BUILD NOW IT NEVER WILL
no What a sad, sad, little man.  https://www.facebook.com/199870617084581/posts/544281499310156/
no BC Lynch what's taking so long? It's been a couple years I think.
yes Well you no what he's talking the food of the table .and don't you think there's enough homeless people all ready.what about kids how are they going to eat .and he's putting wall.well every one staves.thats wrong.i pray he will never be are present again.no way.
no Five people were gunned down and  murdered by a crazed American  citizen in Aurora, Illinois,  Meanwhile at the border.....
yes its irrelevant whether the murderer was an illegal immigrant or not..
yes And what about the shooting in Illinois, idiot!?
no 65 countries, worldwide have erected border walls / fences AND they are working.
no Emergency  like  this
yes Eva Graham Impeach her?  How does that work with the Democrats controlling the House, moron?
yes What about the far larger amount of legals killing legals? I can go to a bar on any given night and witness a bunch of people driving off over the legal limit. Beyond drunk driving, legal citizens of the U.S. are far more likely to commit crimes statistically. What are we doing for the far lager amount of people hurt by legals?
yes This is how American citizens treat their children in our own country? https://www.abc15.com/national/texas-parents-arrested-after-young-children-found-locked-in-dog-cage-living-in-squalor
yes Apple Rivera  Maddening and unfortunate for you. Build the wall!
no Kimberly Mansfield compare those killed in mass shooting per year to the number killed by illegal aliens every year.     As for money to help people, illegal aliens cost the US $100+ billion every year.
yes Build the wall. Real Americans are behind you and thank you for protecting us!!
yes Must protect lame omelet bar!!!  https://apple.news/AIWuX-87OR7O9vdXaU2Sqsw
yes Take the $14bil seized from El Chapo and build that wall!!! You can then bypass all of the crooked congress that want the drugs here-#winwin Donald J. Trump
no Tommy John most likely he will just create another bill to redo the spending, or take the money from another budget.
no Hal Eric Mitlitsky  you are obviously not keeping up with the news.  No collusion.  Just 2 years of wasted money and time because Dems cant accept Hillarys defeat
no Kevin Marquardt, Nora Arevalo is right they still use tunnels. So whats the point of a wall. And they still drive trucks like you said so again whats the point of a wall?
yes So with the protections you signed after the emergency declaration do negate the wall?  Not seeing it
no And how many Legal  (Americans) have killed the daughters of other Americans ??
no I was almost killed by 5 of them in Texas ! ...oh and yeah they got away with it with no problem at all !
yes It's nice to see the compassion for those who lost loved ones. I too am sorry for your losses. But, a wall will not bring those people back, nor will it protect us from anything. Statists don't lie.  These people guilty of taking lives are no different than anyone else. They just made poor decisions, or chose to be evil. There are many many more people that make bad decisions already here naturally. There are many many more deaths from opioids, starvation, guns than the very few caused by illegal aliens.  I am sorry for you losses. I wish you all peace if you can find it.
no Trump BUILD THE WALL.
yes If criminals use Ports of Entry. Why do they dig so many tunnels along the border?
no Bill Johnson never Mr Tromp he don't care for any one .. only for him .. An I a republican an a vet  ..  toll me Tromp return the money of department of education for veterans
yes Angel Neavin Im sorry to hear that and hope they are ok. When I was 14 years old a car load of illegals had been drinking and they ran into my cousin and her friend (in Texas) who were on a motorcycle. They were killed.
yes I would sue Nancy Pelosi and every person that voted against border security. I would sue the sanctuary cities that put these criminals up for refuge. I do NOT support frivolous lawsuits. However, I do not believe this would be a frivolous lawsuit. I believe it would be a wake up call to those who oppose the safety of the American people.
no Very sad! So sorry for the loss of this mans daughter.
yes We MUST keep our country safe...
no Who killed 5 Americans yesterday!?
no Alexis Lavoie...
yes Dante Noel Your some kind of special.
yes Thank you mr. president for your dedication to kerping us safe. Sorry there are people out there who are so mean about you.
yes Democrats dont want you to be successful because they dont have anything that comes close to what you have dont in two years. MAGA Mr. President
no So sorry for all your losses BUILD THE WALL ALREADY NO ONE ELSE HAS TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF THE DEMOCRATS.GOD BLESS ALL OF THE ANGEL PARENTS AND ANGEL FAMILIES.
no You gotta remember liberals dont care about anyones kids they abort all theirs
yes Hal Eric mitlitski, you are literally too dumb to insult.
yes Terri Reeves there is an enormous amount of scholarly literature on the analysis of REAL data received from border agents and agencies. There is an enormous amount of data available after decades of research, its all there you just have to look. These are based on STATISTICS and not opinion.
no Enough is enough! So sorry for your loss.
yes Well as I understand it the wall is primarily built to stem the rotating flow of 400.000 deportations and illegal entries every year. The berlin wall and the soviet/russian border towards finland required guardtowers,minefields,troops,dogs etc to be efficient.
no YES WE NEED BUILD BORDER WALL NOW
no Eva Graham ; last post 2/18.  Comments are full if these revived, foreign, & newly created Facebook accounts to show support for propaganda and spread discord.
yes Jim Russell cuz it is not an emergency
yes Marjorie Anderson and the answer is?????????? Can YOU answer the question instead of acting like your cool aid master
no Wall? It will not do anything except create more tunneling. Focus on our infrastructure.
yes Formerly deported, but came back to Adams County PA.  https://fox43.com/2019/02/15/mexican-citizen-accused-of-raping-child-in-adams-county/
yes THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES AND IS DESTROYING AMERICA!
no Im so sad to hear this.  Law-of-Destiny convicts government officials for this and many other EASILY preventable deaths.  NO EXCUSE.  Build that wall
yes Sorry to hear... if the wall is already built and we have illegal immigrants inside of the country that is not the biggest problem because it is easy to find here inside the country and easy to deport...
no Yeah... There are millions of people in the country. This is anecdotal
yes Obviously truth
no You idioits actually believe itll work lol
yes 1976 Creation of NEA 2001 9/11 2009 Swine Flu epidemic 2019 $$ for  Wall. Which one isnt an emergency?
yes Your statistic doesn't hold any proof... especially if you live in El Paso, Tx
no Drugs still get into prisons  Prisons have walls
no God bless them.
no Build the WALL
yes https://www.wikihow.com/Survive-in-Federal-Prison
yes Getting rid of you will keep us safer than anything!
yes ****"Simply What I See From These We MUST COMPLETE THE WALL....!!!! :) " ****  ****"May The Triple Gems Bless You All....!!!! :) " ****  ****"Our Jesus Bless You All....!!!! :) " ****
no Larry Lubiner it's already happening... might as well get on this Trump train ole son TRUMP 2020 because you aren't going to have any Democrap presidents for the next 100 years
no Guns don't kill people, Democrats Do
yes Marilyn Carter there you go again. I rest my case.
yes Mr President Donald J. Trump Vice President Mike Pence can you investigate this: California's Cash Crop of Harvested Votes in Midterm & Other Liberal Cra... https://youtu.be/V2_hDCB1b0M
yes John Fahrer vets will get help from the billions we spend every year on handouts to illegals.
no there are people in this world that wont agree unless it happens to them.. that's baffling to me.
no Teresa Pagniano there will still be "junk" brought in.
yes John N Karen Morris  I copied this thank you for posting it! Very good information!
yes We need the wall to help those doing a very good job to protect we the people it would make their job not so difficult.
yes Yes democrats killing babies and illegal killing young American
yes Walls work! I live by the border lets create a safer GREATER AMERICA!!!
yes Reason why President Trump won election. Making America Great Again...Building the wall to keep us safe....Democrats Political Power Issue against Trump...well NancyPelosi  Tear down your security Cameras Fences Walls Doors Windows to your home and see how safe you feel....President Trump has accomplished more than any President in office....Make Certain Nancy Pelosi and her Democrand are on the other side of the wall....
yes South Korean communist fake president Moon Jae - in tries to control the online use of South Koreans. I can not advise Trump if the sns are controlled.  South Korea 's fake President Moon Jae - in must be punished like Hussein of Iraq.
yes What about the thousands who have been brutally murdered by Americans who never should have been allowed a gun in the first place?? Gun reform works.
no Hello Dave how are you
no Carol Starr mental illness? That's an act of terrorism wether you were born in USA or not , your race, religion or w.e. someone who did the same thing the guy in Vegas did is a terrorist.
yes This wall thing is such an emergency that it will immediately be followed by golf.
yes Jackie Lee Collins the majority of the prison population is minority and Hispanic, try again
no Build that wall!  Trump 2020!
yes Ask prisoners if walls work.
no Yay!
yes I with Trump
no Stupid analogy.
yes Larry Lubiner it's already begun. I bet you're one of the same over confident tools that says there was no way Trump would be President to begin with. Keep speaking in your absolute never, we'll keep laughing at your stupidity. Under the declarations he used, they can't stop them in court. So,, coming soon to a border near you, a nice big 50 ft. barrier, complete with sharpened spikes at the top
no There is going to be a second civil war the way we are going.
yes I guess it means nothing to you that when an illegal commits a murder in this country.......YES that is his focus and it should be.............
yes Keep up the good work President Trump. Thank you for donating your paychecks, so I truly can mean it when I say thank you for your service.  PS My fondest memories of NYC involved my visits to the Trump Tower.
yes I never imagined that we would literally have to fight our own government just to keep us safe .this new democrat party is out of control and they need stoped before they kill us all
no PUT UP THE WALL!!!!!!!!!!!!
yes Build that wall,
no Danny Jones with you Danny... #pleasegiveusastrongleaderlikeTrump
yes Dante Noel you are the one that needs help!
yes How about all the other drunk drivers who are American losers? I understand that you are hurting but the Wall is not immigration policy.
yes How about the killings in Illinois yesterday? Would a wall have prevented that? Would a wall have prevented the shootings in Parkland? In Aurora?
yes I submit that things consistently being uncontrollable at the border for so many years proves that the only way to actually gain control over it IS to declare it a national emergency. It's clear just trying to legislate activity hasn't done anything substantial.  If alcohol is negatively impacting your liver and you continue to drink doesn't that call for stronger measures against drinking? So a doctor informs you to stop or you'll die. Yet you continue to imbibe alcohol. At what point does that become considered a health emergency? Or do you just keep hearing that you have to stop or you'll die until that actually becomes the reality. By then it's to late to respond with corrective action. ...in this case America is the "body" and drugs are killing the body. Over the years it's only getting worse. They say they will stop it with legislation but never really stop it. The addict is going to allow themselves to die and the members of the body are sort of not wanting to let that happen. Only the "brains" of the American body aren't acting in unity to get the body off drugs, away from violence and separated from corruption.
yes Fine words.......... Show Us The Proof instead of the headline ?
yes I just don't understand how American people can feel more sympathy for illegals than their own fellow Americans. Pretty sure the left is totally anti everything American :(
yes I refuse to argue with a myopic liberal moron, you will just drag me down and beat me with experience!  Illegal border jumper killers are everywhere, who knows maybe drunk in a car near you!
no I see ulot of peoples on this page talking about drunk driveers I lost my hold family from a druck driver only I live out of 4 peoples.
no sorry for your loss but we need to put the blame where blame is due to the last 5 president's promise it and never did a dam thing so I blame them  [  I THINK MR TRUMP IS SENT FROM GOD HIMSELF ]]
yes Ron O'Hearn no need to save anything for me. I don't live in the world's most  moronic country,  thankfully  ...
yes https://www.npr.org/2019/01/10/683662691/where-does-illegal-immigration-mostly-occur-heres-what-the-data-tell-us
no By the way #WhatCulture?
yes What if.   What if.     That is so stupid.   What if you're momma swallowed
yes While this is a tragic story, I can't help but wonder how many illegals kill Americans vs how many Americans kill Americans. Would be an interesting comparison to start with.
no If you want to keep us safe then have national constitutional carry.
yes We have problems at the border, I don't think anyone denies this. But 'National Emergency'? Billions of dollars going that way, when there are so many other (undeclared) 'National Emergencies' where $$$, time & energy are equally or even more important? (our infrastructure, the opioid crisis, homeless, no healthcare, our vets, etc etc etc) Each side (Democrats or Republicans) tells you only what they want you to hear & believe. Our 'job' as individuals is to listen to both sides, yet believe neither side in entirety & then to do our own research in finding the Truth. We mustn't be Sheep...being blindly led to slaughter by either party.
yes Build That Wall!!
yes Alex Cusma
yes Yes I agree
yes Why this dude head remind me of a thick booty bitch lol
yes 85% of people who come in here illegally overstay their visas. And those people are Canadians. Why don't you build a wall on the northern border, you morons?

no Seriously how many Americans kill people what kind of a stupid reason is that
yes So when is a wall going around trump tower????
yes Did someone say impeach Pelosi???
no After completing the war, we need to work on gun control Mr president
no Joseph Roy  it had to be Fox News . Realistically tho are you stupid to the point where you believe rape will end in the us after all the illegals are gone? Will there still be innocent people getting shot by police, and more innocent people getting shot by crazy Caucasians? That walls not gonna solve all these issues in America, and Im sorry if youre stupid enough to believe something like that.
yes I bet they did it with a gun...
no You want them in this country where men and women have lost their lives to protect it ? Then open your doors and homes and let them in ? No ???? Didn't think so.
no We Love u President Trump 2020
no Agree 100%. Build the wall.

yes SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS  VILE VICIOUS VINDICTIVE EVIL demonRATS  ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HER DEATH LET US NOW DESTROY THEM
no These killers ...They are not illegal immigrants, they are illegal aliens, with no business being here in the USA,.. before I applied to become a citizen... I was a legal immigrant ( 10 year wait)  then I was classified as a resident alien ( 8 year wait) , then finally I took the citizenship exam & became a naturalized citizen. We must allow #45 to complete the border wall.
yes Curtis Rice your a jerk
yes We were hit from behind while on the way to work. The driver of the other car, an older white woman, pulled up beside us and shouted that she was going to pull off to the side of the road. Then she turned off her lights so we couldn't see her license plate, and drove off. Our car was destroyed, and I required medical attention, and she just left us there. Another time an older white woman wrecked our car, and hers, by making a left turn from the right lane without looking. She then, unsuccessfully, tried to convince the police it was our fault. Another older white woman backed into my car in a parkinglot, denting in the front and breaking my headlight. Despite doing this in front of a police officer, she hit the gas and sped off. When they caught her we discovered she didn't have insurance. Once, when driving a work truck on the interstate, an older white man became enraged because I wasn't driving fast enough in the fast lane. I had to be in that lane because my exit was coming up off of it, and I had to slow down to 60 because my truck wouldn't have made the turn otherwise. He sped up, cut in front of me, and slammed on his breaks. Somehow I managed to stop in time. If my truck hadn't been empty, I would have certainly hit him, and we both could have been killed. I have never had an unpleasant encounter of any kind with an immigrant, legal or otherwise. Middle-aged white people are another story.
no says the american from the UAE hahahahaha
no Build the Wall. Keep America Safe. Thank you President Trump!!
yes People lives with no border is safe for new world
no God bless Donald Trump.
no As long as it isn't your family who is dead, right?! As long as it hasn't cost you personally, yet!  It isn't a competition ffs! Illegal border jumpers are not supposed to be here, FULL STOP! Between the ACA and these illegals flooding our ERs and hospitals for FREE, my 36 year old daughter is dead, how are your kiddos?!
no If we still had investigative journalists, it would be pretty easy for them to track this down.. law enforcement still cooperates between American and Mexico.
yes I know we're ALL terrified
no Annette Keller I used to drive for a living, and spent a lot of hours on the road. I'm sure the people who crashed into me had their side of the story, but the police who investigated agreed with my side. If you can tell me how it was my fault a woman ran into the back of me while I was at a red light, I'd be glad to listen. What do I know, maybe turned off her lights and sped off away from the scene because she had to use the bathroom really bad. Innocent people do that all the time.
no #Protection for American families is my highest priority. Walls work and will keep us safe! #DonaldTrumpBestPresidentUSForever
yes So you shut down the government and forced hardship onto over a million Americans when you could've just declared this 'emergency' then?
no Emily Neal Americans will never go for it. They are smart enough to know that only the law abiding will turn in guns, leaving them completely defenseless against criminals.
no Build the Wall!!!!!!
yes please get Donald Jr. off the campaign   trail,,,,,,,OMG
yes Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin 4) American Optimism   ~Small business optimism has hit historic highs.  ~NFIBs small business optimism index broke a 35 year-old record in August.  ~Evwn leftist SurveyMonkey/CNBCs small business confidence survey for Q3 of 2018 matched its all-time high.  ~Manufacturers are more confident than ever. 95 percent of U.S. manufacturers are optimistic about the future, the highest ever.  ~Consumer confidence is at an 18-year high. 12 percent of Americans rate the economy as the most significant problem facing our country, the lowest level on record.  ~Confidence in the economy is near a two-decade high, with 51 percent rating the economy as good or excellent.
yes Places that have the strictest gun control measures have the most gun violence making it harder for law abiding citizens to have guns while criminals continue to get them however they please makes zero sense! It makes people less safer!
yes https://www.facebook.com/TheOther98/photos/a.115969958413991/2503185179692445/?type=3&theater
yes Jeff Sterup  I'm so sick of liberal stupidity.  Crime is a state issue.  This is a federal issue since it has to do with illegal immigration.   Stop voting Democrat, and your state will fair better.  Also, go back to school and educate yourself on state and federal issues.  You must have skipped government classes.
yes Oh I can yes. But if we're an illegal who starts his own business and hires other illegals.... Or if you are a home owner looking for cheap labor because your don't make the most money in the the world. Then you hire a guy of Mexican decent but he speaks good English. Only to find his "work" is shabby at best and that that man is not even legally here....
yes Sounds exactly like, "An armed man killed my daughter. Democrats are right - we need gun control." Both the left and right use horrific incidents to justify their policy proposals. We cannot let anger and emotion drive our political discourse.
yes Yes build the wall
yes Conservatives- DoNt PoLiTiCizE gUn DeAtHs, sTuPiD DeMs  Also Conservatives- Politicize deaths at the hands of illegal immigrants.   UPDATE- You are just as dead if you're killed by an illegal immigrant as you are by a legal citizen. Only difference is, more people are killed by legal citizens every year than illegals lol. BaN uS cItIzEns!!
yes https://m.sandiegoreader.com/news/2011/jan/27/blogs-toni-atkins-developer-dollars/
yes California
yes build the wall for get the dumocrat.
yes Danny Jones we need our own Donald Trump! Hes the greatest President of all time
no or you for defending him?
yes Thank You for All The Hurt You Put Up With Mr President
no Anthony Clark go drink some more Flint water
no If you have open borders you know longer have a border!!!! I agree with Trump 100%.
no Trump is genius
no https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/284
no Israel has a BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL around it and it obviously works. Google "Israel barrier" under Google images.
yes Paul Seldes how many children die daily at the hands of democrats allowing abortion...
yes CliffandKim Ferrell That is RIGHT!  Trump 2020!
no So sorry for youre loss Build the wall
yes Boss congratulations for your presedent day I wish all the best for you and your family
yes You have my condolences sir
yes Adrianna Anders are Democrats taking money from the drug cartels politicians all see motivated by money over the best interest for Americans ,their position has no logic,with More than 70,200 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2017, including illicit drugs and prescription opioidsa 2-fold increase in a decade. ... Drug overdose deaths rose from 16,849 in 1999 to 70,237 in 2017. The bars are overlaid by lines showing the number of deaths by gender from 1999 to 2017 (Source: CDC WONDER).
no Larry Lubiner What a stupid question, totally unrelated to the wall issue.  Did existing strict gun laws? Did Democrats or liberals?  Did the city government, or the state?
yes Only reason Obama was in office is cuz he was voted in illegally & Democrat knows it. He's anti-American & has been raised that way
yes I'm so sorry for your lost!!  I know words aren't enough when you've lost a love one!!
yes Then do Mandatory E-verifying if it is
yes Very sorry and ashamed that this happened. This shouid never happen to an American Citizen. Our Congress especially the Democrats are betraying Americans. Muslims should not be in America or holding any kind of Offices either . Many Red flags from Congress going off that American Citizens must be aware of and have strong awareness that betrayal is happening Big time. We need to fully support President Trump, because Congress is against us.
yes We have four National Emergencies. Climate Change, Fake Elections, Guns and a Lying Traitorous president.
yes sometimes by the wisdom of force
no While these are heartbreaking stories the fact that the driver was in the country illegally has nothing to do with the traffic accident, the driver ran a red light because he was drunk
no Id be happy to respond Debi but you are a coward and blocked me so I dont know what you said.
yes I support securing our border and strongly enforcing immigration laws. An undocumented immigrant does not have the legal right to be in this country, so if they commit a crime and are here illegally,  I consider that a failure of the federal goverment and our immigration system
no Dumb ass Democrats. Baby killers. Enough said.
yes Majestica Arlene that's the most illogical and uninformed spew I've read in days!
yes I support mr trump. It is a need the wall descition is great
no Heart felt prayers to all who have lost loved ones. Yes we NEED a WALL
no Take all the security away from Congress. They forget who they work for. Remind them we the people are their employers. Use their security money to  BUILD DAT WALL!!!
no Melissa Lamphere just how many is a  few bad people?
no MAGA.....remove a democrat from government.
yes Jo Sechi And your point is?
no Emily Neal omg, Google it.  It's common knowledge.   Quit being so damn lazy.  Geeze!
yes My sister had cancer once and we built a wall. Not only did it cure her cancer, but I believe it actually has cured all cancers ever since. True story. Its fake news if you hear otherwise
yes YES, BUILD THE WALL. AMERICA BE SAVE WITH THE WALL.
yes I believe in you, Mr. President.
no Eva Graham   Seriously? You have to stop drinking the Kool-Aid.  Let him open Pandora's Box. Remember, once you open Pandora's Box you can't close it.  Donald Trump. Go ahead and declare a National Emergency. One of two things will happen. Either you will lose in court. Or, the next Democratic president will declare a National Emergency for climate change, gun control, DACA, Health Care reform and middle-class tax cuts. Just to start with. 
yes Estefania Torres Restrepo so how does anyone accurately determine how many people or the amount of drugs have came into the US undetected?  That's right, you can't.  The argument of most/majority and legal ports of entry is just guesswork trying to be passed off as fact. A wall is a deterrent, along with the increased border enhancements.  They go hand in hand in preventing the illegal crossing of the border.  Come in legally, they are more than welcome.  Come in  illegally, no.   Opinions are not facts.
yes Fight the good fight build that wall, Sir
no Did you know there are shovels in Mexico? https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-01-18/nearly-400-migrants-tunnel-under-border-wall-to-enter-united-states-from-mexico
yes Mr. President, Americans cannot only be protected by building wall between America and Mexico. There are other means through which this can be done. Stop putting pressure on public purse
yes FINISH THE WALL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
no And hundreds of other children have been killed by fellow Americans so what is the real crisis here.
yes Piper Tunno the shooters are either dead or in prison.  We have criminal citizens who are punished. We dont need to add illegal criminals from other countries to the ones we already have.
no Neil Wiseman  And who's showing their ignorance, lying about our President.
yes Amen, more killings by illegals, than we have been told.
yes Jeanie Railsback  Al-Bashir is killing the unarmed demonstrators by live bullets Al-Bashir is a dictatorship that oppresses people in satellite channels. The uniform is owned in Sudan. Bashir is holding people in detention camps until death. Join us in the intifada to gain our
yes They are the mulattos from the great abysmal swamp in North Carolina and Virginia that we freed in 1865.  This is their country.
yes Thank you President Trump for keeping us safe!
yes So sorry that happened! It never should have happened!
yes Thank you Mr. President
yes Abel da Silva the band or the state of being?
yes Ron O'Hearn but where's the exaggeration and fear mongering?
no Lynn Limauro Floyd what does the wall have to do with it?
yes What else is there?  They talk about security.  Obama did.  Other Democrats do.  But the sanctuary cities and stupid laws for their protection just make things worse.  They are all talk.  A wall will work.  It wont keep everyone out, of course. But it will keep many out.  And until they show other REAL ideas, I want a wall.  I have been jumped by illegals.  I was very lucky.  Protect AMERICANS, not illegals
yes Why is Trump sharing an article from one of the "fake news" mainstream media?
yes So much good will come from building the wall. Trump 2020.
no Reread my comment, good Lord.
no Build the Wall!
yes CliffandKim Ferrell dont you wonder how many of the trolls on this page are actually illegal themselves??
yes Thank you, President Trump for putting America first.
no Some of you people are painfully dumb.. Go live elsewhere if you don't like what Trump is doing
yes Cindy Sak Nowak so you believe that when the government has shootouts with people that refuse to give up their rights because the illegal firearms owners aren't going to obey the law then everything gets better. You are to damn dumb. You say Chicago laws aren't strict enough yet open carry cities are some of he safest in the country.
no BUILD THE WALL!!!
yes Yet nothing about the 30,000 plus gun deaths caused by American citizens every year. 
yes Crisis actors
yes Katie Vigna Some of us love our country, Katie...you clearly don't.
yes ...they won't do anything...i know many who are here and working illegally...i know one that was pulled over for speeding, had no license, speaks very little english, the cop gave her a warning for both violations...
yes Build that wall President Trump!
yes If youre going to build a wall on the border with Mexico, wouldnt you also build walls on both coasts and our border with Canada? And if you do that, wouldnt make sense just to isolate ourselves from the world, cease all trade and just curl up into a ball and ignore the realities of life? LOL at the WALL. #SmokeAndMirrors
yes What about all the people that have been killed by Americans?  Like the five killed in Aurora yesterday?  Dont they count?
no So sad.  Build the wall as big as possible!
no Play Video
yes F the wall!
no Jimm Jenkens your right. And the founding fathers made sure we would have the right to bare arms in the future with the 2nd amendment.  That's so we can defend ourselves from those that would do us harm and the socialist government that is trying to arbitrate a coup against our duly elected government
yes My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no drivers license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputys car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL
no Sharon Fantana run at it full bore , you'll get your answer
yes What about the Americans killing Americans? Never mention anything about that!!
yes I cant wait until the next president  a Democrat  calls a national  emergency  for the health care crisis in the USA. Finally something  will get done to help the American  people. Thank you President  Trump for setting the precedent.  And, oh by the way the next Democrat  president  will  also be able to declare a national  emergency  and ban guns that kill people when there is the next school  shooting.  Thank you again president  Trump for making  America great again! You alone have changed America  forever
no We have to build it first, to see if it works.
no MAGA! Mr Trump 2020
yes Veronica:  You are a liar. You have never been to London and that didnt happen.
yes Democrats only want your vote, not your safety. BUILD THE WALL.
yes So many lives tragically lost... LAW'S work if they're inforced. Secure our Border's Mr. President. BUILD THE WALL
no The Department of Defense pegs U.S. casualties in Iraq at 4,491 and Afghanistan at 2,356 for a total of 6,847 lost servicemen during the two wars.  Rep Steve King (R-IA), one of the most ardent immigration hawks in Congress, pegs that the numer of americans killed by illegal aliens in the same two years as the war, comes out to roughly 4,380 per year. A Thats a big problem
yes Build the Wall!!!
no As Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, Trump can drain the entire $30 billion from the Pentagon, National Guard, Coast Guard, Space Force, and the military budgets to complete the entire wall for his 'national crisis' in less than 2 years.
no AMEN!  RIP.
no Brett Gibson awwww does he hurt your feelings???
yes Eddie Gonzalez poor me? Your sarcasm shows your intelligence, and that you have none. Im advocating for families who lost their loved ones, not myself. I was lucky to just come out alive with only injuries.
yes Kathy Smith Williams depends who the next president is walls have been taken down before.
yes That's simply silliness. How many white, males have killed, maimed, tortured other U.S. citizens? Can we deport them too? No, we build prison walls and once they are released or escape or die, we consider it justice served. We don't blame the entire white, male race, do we? This is simply another example of you race hating.
yes Stupidest. President. Ever. Mueller is Coming! And almost all of the pro-trump posters here are fake accounts, also known as russian bots.
yes Joseph Bernadzikowski did you like what Obama did... did you live somewhere else
no Build that wall ,prayers
yes I have a wall around my property. Keeps out everybody.

yes Katy Chavez yeah sis because mexicans are the ones illegally crossing the boarder  yall stay on your own fuckin side and it wouldnt be a problem to begin with. duh
yes Always President Donald Trump and Melania first lady God bless.  The wall will be build.
no Jim Butkowsky I guess you won't be saying that if it was your family
no Kris Landers so those who befriend or stand behind illegals are to blame for illegals actions? I like that idea.
no You sound like a 4 year old!
yes So sorry for your loss sir . We stand behind you and we mourn with you
no Because of the wall you might killer her and blame immigrants I think you have also forgot that your wore a immigrant in USA
yes But Americans kill Americans all day everyday and no one seems to care about that

yes All 55 miles   So much winning, Im not happy!   Be best, trolls
no Maria Nichols you ever get tired of being a loser?
yes President Trump is correct and this gentleman has suffered a great loss.  He knows first hand that a Wall will help.  May his daughter R.I.P. I am very sorry the loss of your child.
yes He not come to politics just to help you, idiot. He has his own plan for himself and his friends.
no Anthony Witcombe ok

yes Wall wall wall .yes..
yes What about the senseless killing in Illinois by someone who had a gun and shouldn't have, the children in so many schools killed senselessly.  Tragic.  Yet nothing done about that.
no Danny Jones Definitely, a troll!
yes How about the kids dying from mass shootings? What about them?
no I support wall 100% for drugs dillers
yes Put walls around this clown
no Was this dude illegal or any of the mass shooters in the past 10 years for that matter? https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/02/15/5-dead-in-aurora-workplace-shooting/
yes Kelly Anders hopefully you realize that not all illegal immigrants are brown.  Also, what does being gay have to do with your fear of white men?  I probably don't understand the issues you face because #1 I'm straight and #2 a person's life choices, sexuality, political affiliation, skin color, etc aren't really things I think about when I meet someone or pass them on the street.  My first impression of people is usually based on whether they are polite and pleasant or have a chip on their shoulder and a crappy attitude.  Other than that, I personally don't go throughout my daily life in fear of much.  I do believe that illegal immigration is a problem in the United States.
yes Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin  3) American Income   ~Median household income rose to $61,372 in 2017, a post-recession high.  ~Wages up in August by their fastest rate since June 2009.  ~Paychecks rose by 3.3 percent between 2016 and 2017, the most in a decade.  ~Council of Economic Advisers found that real wage compensation has grown by 1.4 percent over the past year.  ~Some 3.9 million Americans off food stamps since the election.  ~Median income for Hispanic-Americans rose by 3.7 percent and surpassed $50,000 for the first time ever in history. Home-ownership among Hispanics is at the highest rate in nearly a decade. Poverty rates for African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans have reached their lowest levels ever recorded.
yes Deb Shriver try 54 million, not 4 million.
yes You show me in the Constitution where it states you can not use money to protect the US citizens
no Immigrants killed thousands of my people. Thanks, pilgrims.
yes My Heart goes out to the Family.
yes https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States
yes Comparing people to dogs... seriously?
yes Mike Mandel that was in his initial package that Nancy said no to.  Geeze, dont you people ever pay attention?
yes Sorry about your son
no Justin Fox so we dont need a wall   Feds bring drugs into this country too
yes BUILD OUR WALL - WALLS WORK - KEEP AMERICA SAFE & MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !!
no Please make an executive order to change the name of our country to Mexico, to fulfill your prophecy that Mexico will pay for the wall.
yes What is disgusting is that You can't accept the truth more reality
yes Maureen Hersey Brown get your asses out of other countries and then talk.  The sad part about it is.  A white man would kill you quicker if you took your front door off.  I guess you whites think your god fearing righteous citizens.  Don't make me laugh.  Look at who have been the serial killers, all white.
yes If the wall is as big as this man's forehead I can sleep well at night
yes Illegal immigrants coming here to destroy Americans & turn this country into a 3rd world country with the help and support of UN American Democrats !!
yes USA has killed most people over the world how many Americans cross borders to take advantage of child prostitution and so much to list here that not counting asholes
yes Claiming 7 ??. You have no idea what you are talking about
no Compile a list of people who would be STILL ALIVE today and send it to the court 9th and way they want to start  killing babys     Dam  wat these blood thirsty  dem up to . I see a great March coming
yes Wall wall wall Trump fart you will be buried under southern walls stop crying wall wall
no Too bad that the unholy demoncrats could dare less.
no Donna Williford Burger - Donna/ all these people who dont think the wall is necessary- I have a perfect way to change their minds.... delete  President Trump   Insert  President Hillary Clinton
yes Many States have a 2x - 3rd jail. It helps until someone gets out. It's an addiction and needs treated as such. But it takes like all addictions. The addict has to work hard at staying sober for life. It's a decision with prayers. Illegals need to stay out of America period. They should be tried for murder ..
no What are we doing about all the mass shootings? This is a scare tactic. Give border patrol what they want. This wall has become a huge distraction.
yes If they didn't work..Nancy and Chuck wouldn't have them around their property
yes Ah, why is it that every time I discuss anything. Every right winger brings up "black on black crime in chicago". Do you even know the circumstances leading up to the massive crime in that area? Do you know the history? Because it starts with right wing policies. Since gun control measures in Chicage, crime has seen a steady decrease yearly. So we started there. What's your point? Is a wall going to keep you safe, definitely not. Not when the major terrorists in this nation are home-grown of the white right wing variety.
yes America first! Trump 2020!
yes Hichem snitches get stitches
yes  Please, where ever youre coming from, come to the USA legally.
yes You are so right. God Bless your daughter.
no I've never hired an illegal, I wonder how many thousands Don the Con has hired?????
yes Hopefully Gov. you won't wind up with the blood of the good people of California on your own hands.
yes Alberto Weisz
no So sorry for your loss. These idiots who turn their heads and pretend not to hear or see what is going on because see they haven't had a loved one killed by an illegal are fooling themselves if they think they are going to remain safe if this situation isnt dealt with. I stand with our president, and I stand with all who have lost a loved one because the Democrats refuse to help support the wall.
yes So sad build the wall and throw the democrats over it
no Agree.  Was just at the border to drop off family at PCT start. And it was crazy to see the wall there in person.  Down by Campo CA.  We need the Border protected. Thank you for fighting the good fight for all of us that agree with you.
yes Yet thousands of times more americans killed by home grown terrorists and donnie does nothing... blame the immigrants but the statistics do not support.
yes BEST PRESIDENT EVER!!!!!!
yes Michala Dotson were not talking about immigrants, were talking about ILLEGAL aliens. There IS a difference.
no #buildthewall
yes i'm tired of the hypocritical BS coming from the left. Just build the freaking wall already. get it done. it's been labeled as a crisis for 30 years, primarily by democrats. but not today. stand your ground Mr. President!
no Patti Cullen stfu go chase cars ugly
yes Edgar D. GutierrezTexas is the only state to track crime specifically among illegal immigrants let's use them as an example:  Between January 2011- January 2019 there have been 10 school shootings in the state of Texas. Of those 10 shootings 15 people have died and 28 have been injured.   Now let's look at crime amongst illegal immigrants in Texas. "Between June 1, 2011 and January 31, 2019, 189,000 illegal aliens were charged with more than 295,000 criminal offenses. DPS criminal history records reflect those criminal charges have thus far resulted in over 120,000 convictions including 238 HOMICIDE convictions; 13,662 assault convictions; 3,158 burglary convictions; 17,930 drug convictions; 175 kidnapping convictions; 7,100 theft convictions; 11,336 obstructing police convictions; 1,013 robbery convictions; 1,710 sexual assault convictions; 1,153 sexual offense convictions; and 1,282 weapon convictions."  That's just one state.
yes Someone stole one of my favorite dogs. Sometimes I'm really pissed off. Other days I'm sad.  I miss my dog.
yes Lisa Mann Mr. Trump will not be President forever but the wall will.
yes Build that wall!  So sorry for your loss, heartbreaking!
yes I know 500 people who were shot almost killed in Vegas.... Anything being done about that?  Your promise that Mexico will pay for it died yesterday
no Please help America President Trump!
no I'm sorry for the loss of life due to illegal aliens but how many death from homegrown players deaths from no insurance or drugs to save them America is broke and istead of fixing it we are building a wall
no BC:  Nope, try again low output person  https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2016/11/29/another-clinton-trump-divide-high-output-america-vs-low-output-america/  I live in NYC, we dont need Amazon, but funny how they wanted to come to our liberal bubble

yes Please please please build that Wall Mr Trump
yes barbara your full of crap!
no But nothing at all has been done about the dozens of white men/citizens who have been involved in mass shootings over many years in this country. Schools, malls, concerts. How about you address that?!!!
no Michael Thompson if that's the case let's ban guns. It will save a life , right cons?
yes So sorry,, so so sorry.  It shouldve never happened.  This problem shouldve never existed.  Nothing will ever replace what youve lost. Really hate the pain you must go through every single day.  And to hear politicians act like theres not a problem has to add to your broken heart.  
yes H sorry for you loss and im sorry for all ofthe victis of gun vioence,  walls wont  work,
no A crooked cop killed my friends brother.

no Gabriel Son what would you like for Christmas?
yes First off.. they are Americans..
yes walls work. Stop being petty or take your doors off and let everyone in your house. Hahahaha
no Thank you Mr President for keeping us safe
yes Maybe when the car companies were poisoning the "well," all those politicians that they bought (both Democrat and Republican) voted against regulating them, so now the water in Flint, Michigan is as disaster.  As for "spending money on I th her things," isn't that the point?  Why not spend money on CV leaning up the water in Flint rather than spending on other things?
no Lynn Limauro Floyd So sad! God bless you! Illegal's need to be vetted! Build that WALL!
no That's why with the wall comes tech and other strategies, but it starts with a wall.  Ex...my house has a fence, door, locks, alarm system, guns.  It starts with a fence.
yes I don't understand why there is so much resistance from the democratic party, I guess they need to lose a loved one themselves to know what It feels like.
yes God bless you Mr. President Donald J. Trump and your family
yes Maaaaaaan yall stupid if you think a wall ganna stop immigrants im laying here with 5 of my cousins who climed over it  just 2 days ago
no My son was killed by a drunk driver also. That man was from Long Island New York. Should we put a wall there too? Odds are in the years both of us lost our kids to drunk drivers the majority of them were born & raised in the USA. Does one death matter less because of the who or where they were from?  Yes laws need to be enforced all the way around but especially on the employers that hire undocumented workers.Something so many neglect to mention or enforce. Seems even Trump branded businesses like to hire the undocumented.  Not sure a wall in the middle of the desert would make much of a difference. Ports of entry, towns, cities is different.  Everyone agrees something needs to be done just some of us see the wall as a waste of money from a man that promised Mexico would pay for it. Maybe use fines imposed on businesses that use undocumented labor illegally to pay for a wall where it would be most effective.
no Nazi much? Good grief
no I'm so sorry for the loss of your lovely daughter. We lost a daughter three and a half years ago. She was 25. I am so sorry for you.
no Sorry for your loss! Build the wall!
yes Take the money from El Capo and get it built!  Thanks
no Build that wall America first
no Yes walls work.
yes You helped kill the economy in Atlantic City can we build a wall around your ignorance?
no Lee Mcclelland so we shouldn't have a wall to make it easier for them?
yes Git er done and God bless America!
yes No more murdered Americans
yes A drunk driver killed my friend, we must ban all alcohol. Vaccines hurt my loved one, we must ban all vaccines. A gun man killed my child we must ban all guns. See how none of these are good arguments.
yes Joseph Nowik which will be declared illegal and unconstitutional,  it by that time the wall is built.... the man is a genius....checkmate!!
no I support the wall completely!
no KEEP AMERICA GREAT 2020 Re-elect President Donald J. Trump.
no Build the wall now
no https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/videos/324555401528107/
yes Albert J Destefanis  He May not even get a second term. HAHAHA!
yes I want to report the parents of that kid in your profile pic for neglect. What number do I call? No one should have to grow up with such ignorant parents
yes https://scontent-ort2-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/42743601_1965638283458054_6855950767258337280_n.jpg?_nc_cat=1&_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-2.xx&oh=7109e70aace4b7f3d7dcf041f223dffb&oe=5D26AB43
yes Yes thanks for everything. U.S is great and continueing.
yes We love you president Trump  Best president ever
yes Shame is not in thier vocabulary. I support the wall all the way.
yes Danny Jones it won't matter. Within one more generation the Muslims will have bred themselves into a majority in the UK, and your "culture" will be gone forever anyway.
yes God Bless and protect you, Mr. President. Don't give up the fight...we're with you!
yes Ppl from Chicago come to my town and shoot up the place all the time...should we make a wall for Chicago?
no . Thank you President Trump
no 41 year low.....
no #ImmigrationReform
no These stories are heartbreakingly sad! Bless them in their grief! Build this wall now and secure our nation! Remove all incentives for illegals to come here now!
yes How about the drugs that are made here in the United states that are killing people
yes Trump saying the truth
yes Send me a pic Jason Ward.  I am interested in seeing this WALL thats being built for a month.
no Wheres the data for this? I dont believe your statement.   Let me tell you a story. Someone wants to shoot a big bunch of kids, so they walk into a gun shop, get an semi-automatic gun straight away and goes and shoots up a school. This is the problem.   The solution: the same person wants to shoot a big bunch of kids, they go into a gun shop, background checks are required and then a waiting period. Background check finds the person with multiple mental health/violence issues and are not allowed a gun. Person can not shoot up a school and overtime thousands of lives are saved.
yes Thank you Mr. President for all youre doing
yes Thank you Ms. President for all what you are doing to protect us and make America great again God Bless you and all your Family praying for you always
yes Wall ain't going stop them from coming over hell what are you going to do with the ones that are already over here? nothing exactly
no Keep on Trumpin
yes The Left Wing Liberal Democrats are trying to destroy this Country. America is so fed up with all their bullshit.
yes Stay in Germany, Emil....
no Melissa Ann democrats and a few uncomparable Republicans. Our Presidents got this..
yes George Brakey Why do you think that most of these mass shotters go to no gun zones such as schools and work sweetie!
yes What about overpopulation and the population of foster/adoption facilities/systems? What about the Christians that are pro-life until the child is born then turn their nose up at it and tout "It's your responsibility." Etc.
no WE SURPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP
yes 5 people were killed in Aurora yesterday, NOTHING HAPPENS. 1 white woman gets killed by an immigrant? CLOSE THE BORDERS, HAMBERDER MAN SAYS IT'S AN EMERGENCY!!!!
yes Here in Germany we have thousands illegal migrants... Its not nice, because every day you can read, that resident people killed by knife - attacks. Its Not a Problem to come to Germany from Africa or middleeast states without your papers. Its a disaster. If i have the Chance to live in the United States, i will take it! God bless America!
yes Let's not forget the attempt on Trump's life
yes Renieri Ortiz Illegals aren't immigrants you absolute fool.
yes Democrats don't care how many American citizens are murdered. Only worried about illegals who shouldn't be here in the first place but will somehow vote for them...smdh
yes Charles Landry I don't see any problems being fixed. Bridges clean water sensible gun laws. Seeking asylum is legal. Most are running from violence on their own country..
yes Build the wall, please!!!
yes The hurt will never go away....
yes An American citizen murdered innocent people, and shot police officers in Aurora.  Would a wall have prevented that?
yes Maybe Trump should have thought before signing that awful budget bill...
yes FACT: Net immigration has been declining for the last several years.
no 10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
yes So very sorry for your loss.     It should of never happened.   God bless you.    My prayers are with you
no Please, someone sue the legislators that protect these illegal.aliend.   sue them hard.  As hard as you can.........
yes No wander they want more and more control it's for our own benefit
yes thank you sir for all you endure for us...
yes THE BEUTIFUL WALL IS ALREADY BEING BUILT GOD BLESS THE GREAT PRESIDENT TRUMP.

no They have no right to be alive
no no what is petty it you not understanding that this child wass taken by someone who shouldn't have been here in the first place.  so don't say it is an illegal thing when that is who killed there child.  see if you can get the congress or senate to pass a stiff law for anyone drinking and driving it won't happen cause they are the ones who are doing it all the time and walk away.  don't blame this parent =
no True we need the wall n sorry for your  loss God give you strength

yes Of course we care. But some of us seem better informed and know that fentanyl is flying in from China and that most drugs are intercepted at legal entry points. Trump is lying.
no Florida school gun man is an American
no Wasn't it Crazy Queen Polosi who said "there will be collateral damage, just the way it is?" We Americans better wakeup...last chance we have! Build the wall and take control of our country! Thank you President Trump
no keep up with the times , we enforce the laws and prosocute them.do some research . we have gun control.but we wont tolerate a gun ban
no My condolences but if one black guy had done it, would you call for the arrest of every black man in America? or even their return to Africa?
no Jerika Durrett air head bimbo.
no Anthony Clark wondering why Obama didn't fix it
no Maida Broadbent Williams TROLL
yes BUILD A WALL.  IN NEW MEXICO TOO AS WE ARE DESPERATE TO STOP DRUGS AND VIOLENCE
yes Tyler Dougherty so the same sense would be made for a wall??
yes Right, because we make policy based on people's stories, not science and actual statistics.
yes Said the NRA. #WORSTPRESIDENTEVER
yes Raise the cost of the "work in America visa" . Then you can say Mexico paid for it.
no Kathy Zimmerman Blackwelder lets pray too for the families who have lost loved ones by americans killers. President Trump needs to build the wall. After that, lets see what is he going to do with all the murders of this side of the wall.
no A American citizen killed my brother so how good is your wall when they are killer in America also
yes Would it only be illegal immigrants that would ransack his house? because no Americans would ever commit a crime  moron
yes Margo H Izabal https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/27/nyregion/trump-tower-illegal-immigrant-workers-union-settlement.html
yes Valerie Siggson idiot
yes My husband and I were in a terrible reck in 2013.An illegal immigrant almost killed me and my husband. He was 17 didnt have a license was driving someone elses car. Was going 80 in a 30 miles zone. Before he hit us he passed a car with a family that had 3 little kids in the car. That could had very well killed them Thank god he didnt and my husband had to be cut out of the car. He was drunk on top of that. Didnt spend one night in jail. My husband was I c u for 14 days had too have emergency surgery on his neck and back. This is a man that has never had a broken bone in his body or stitches either. Until that night he still isnt the same till this day. So yes Im all for the wall percent. We need a president like Trump he is the one that can get the job done.
yes Individual 1 exploits these families to fit his narrative. We have walls 650 miles of them. #Donthecon
no raise your hand if you believe a wall would have stopped 9/11!!!
yes Apple, I'm sorry this happened to you, and my thoughts and prayers are with you. I hope you're doing better now. God bless.
yes Hal Bannasch those walls are to keep people in and not out...also, there are guards with guns to shoot the ones trying to escape
yes Tess Marquardt again answer  the question.  People go over and under,  what is wrong with modern technology? Instead of a beautiful  black vanity wall? What is the matter with you??????
yes Has Trump even mentioned the shooting this week of 5 people by Another American  who should not have had a gun. Nothing to do with the southern boarder again.  This post is one immigrant story which is now very old. Add up the amount of Americans our own Americans have killed in mass shootings!The emergency is new gun laws!!! And as for drugs, Americans buy it, sell it and use and will do anything to get it into the US. Most of it coming into ports of call on the east and west coasts. We have drug problems because we want drugs.!
yes Working hard at lying to the American people.
yes If the border wall would work I'd be all for it. But it doesn't. It won't.
yes Sympathies to the family but the odds of her being killed by a mass shooter in school, or by a drunk American are statistically higher than what happened here.   The courts failed long before he got to her.   There is nothing in these articles that say why he was illegal, just that he was suspected of being illegal.  Did he overstay a visa?  Is he a DACA kid?    Too many unknowns.
yes Both partys want the wall ,Just dont want Trump to succeed.
no January 2017 - Trump inaugurated - GOP majorities in both houses of Congress January 2017 Wall not an emergency February 2017 Wall not an emergency March 2017 Wall not an emergency April 2017 Wall not an emergency May 2017 Wall not an emergency June 2017 Wall not an emergency July 2017 Wall not an emergency August 2017 Wall not an emergency September 2017 Wall not an emergency October 2017 Wall not an emergency November 2017 Wall not an emergency December 2017 Wall not an emergency January 2018 Wall not an emergency February 2018 Wall not an emergency March 2018 Wall not an emergency April 2018 Wall not an emergency May 2018 Wall not an emergency June 2018 Wall not an emergency July 2018 Wall not an emergency August 2018 Wall not an emergency September 2018 Wall not an emergency October 2018 Wall not an emergency November 2018 Wall not an emergencyo November 2018 Democratic majority elected in House January 2019  EMERGENCY  Fact: Border apprehensions are at a 45 year low.  There is no crisis at our border. It's fake news.
yes Check out this Https://youtu.be/2uiPpj1t2lc
no Not everybody's going to jump on here and say their family member was killed by illegal just to get attention
yes And how many illegals would you want in your house without your permission?!
yes A 60-high foot wall that spans 1/6 of the border is equal to a door being open? You people are beyond insane. Not to mention he's never going to get it. He's going to be stuck in the courts for years.
yes Jeremy Harbolt how dogist!
no Dave Sienknecht Border busts, Border Patrol agents arrested five men carrying 4 foot tall backpacks with methamphetamine, cocaine and pills over the weekend near Gila Bend. This group was one of 5 groups of smugglers caught by agents in January near Gila Bend. In total, the drugs seized in the incidents was worth about $1.7 million. Customs and Border Protection
yes A wall for germany too, PLEASE :-(
yes Why does in cost $2500 out of my pocket in two weeks going to a doctor to be set up for high blood pressure medicine. I have insurance. Can you work on that one or do i need to vote democrat nrxt time. You promised and failed to deliver.
yes Trump lies for example in the sotu he said one out of three women in the caravans are molested.    The mainstream media looked into it and found trump lied.     Only 31 percent of women in the caravans were found to be molested!  Impeach trump and lock him up!
no Build the wall no matter what the Dems, Pelosi and Schumer say!!
yes #WorstPresidentEVER
no It's Mueller Time!!!!
yes Bill Johnson... trump cares only for trump ...
yes Joan Hamilton it doesn't matter why he was illegal.  The fact that he had no legal right to be here is enough!
yes Barbara Blitfield Pech Barack Obama
no 26 First graders were murdered by a white American !  No one gives a damn about guns, Why a wall?
yes Build the wall please. Talking from experience in Texas
yes We have had over 300 mass killings in this country since trumps fake presidency and none have been at the hands of immigrants!
yes So sorry for your terrible loss..
no I feel for this families, but cant comprehend how dumb dumb can use them for political purposes, a wall is not gonna stop this.
no Felicia Peden Hill your comment isnt showing up for me for some reason
yes Chris Weiss   You Fool!!!!  You may know the skin color because that's the first thing LIBERALS notice! But you have no IDEA whether they were Christian or not!!! Of course, unless you're writing a book and have researched and talked to the families, friends, churches they've attended, basically gathering evidence, facts, quotes from family members, friends, pastors of the churches these White males attended in order to write a book dealing with the mass shootings that occurred in 2017!!!   I know you're not a writer! I know you haven't researched this claim you've made of their religious background!  So why don't you SHUT UP and quit using this asinine claim to bash CHRISTIANITY!!  We have enough of that going on in our country today!!!!!
yes So he walked across the border or overstayed his visa- which is the usual MO?
yes "Everyone wants to rule the World...but you must earn it"...
no Trying to figure out who's opinion I should trust more  CIA NSA  FBI Homeland El Paso has filed a lawsuit on recent visit El Paso Gov't did not attend Trump Rally ?? , believe our Coast Guard that drugs and bad guys coming in Major Ports and tunnels or President who Thank God knows more than all the above I mentioned.  Well it's no contest !!!  The guy I voted for 2 years ago is CLUELESS and out of his element.  When presented with Real Data from his own agencies he was unable to answer reporters questions and you could see the frustration and started to babel incoherent  making up his own facts.  I can't vote for him in 2020.  I hope our GOP comes up with someone with integrity, honesty, dignity and has a healthy respect for women as well as people of color.  I got off the kool aid say 5 months after I voted for him.
yes Would love to hear those words from our leaders
no Lamphier--What is it that you want them to get??

yes ABSOLUTELY!!! And brand every illegal half a dozen spots on their body, require English to be spoken in public, and close down any business working a migrant without proper credentials.
no Thank you President Trump  for everything you do for America and the American people. You're such a great President. We are so very blessed to have you as our President.
no Jo Sechi Drugs kill more people than gun related deaths, so does vehicle drunk driving! How much of this countrys drugs come over our borders????? Over 90%!!!!! Several weeks ago tons of Fentanyl was confiscated at the border, enough to kill thousands!!!! Yes, Jo do some fact checking BUT DO it through a reputable source. My advice; Christian based news, Washington media research, call your senator's to keep informed of bills being passed!!!! STOP listening to bias propaganda, it make your debate ridulious.
yes The biggest problem in America is NOT illegal immigrants, its illiterate imbeciles, better known as TRUMP supporters
yes Margo Smith really?  Where do you get that information?  Did you know 50% of the violent crime in America is committed by 13% of the population.  That 13% ain't white.
no Shut up STUPID
yes Build the wall...NOW! Please!
yes Race baiter pos President.
yes Jennifer Yvonne Croff and your point is?
yes Christopher Thompson I think most of the opposition is because these people know it will work .
no What about the 40,000 americans killed by gun violence in 2018...
no Build the wall. MAGA
yes You did the right thing.
no America right now is under stress, it's doing so much self reflection on it's past. America has to confront those past images that occurred and must apologize to those it affected.
yes Other demo.
no Dan Burnzinsky...Thought???......Did you mean THROW???...
yes are you really that naive and behind in other current events(except for the hate trump ) that you don't know nk is in russia and chinas hip pocket?
no John N Karen Morris now thats a witch hunt... report people just cause ...
yes Deport the rednecks keep the illegals.
no A US worker allowed my disabled son to roll off of a changing table and fall onto a concrete floor.
no The Democrats lust for power is stronger than their desire to make American citizens safer.
yes Horrible !!!!!!
no Democrats and those so-called citizens who opposed the construction of a border wall will never be able to wash from their hands,  the blood of countless American killed by illegal aliens and drugs.
yes Didn't you just sign a bill giving it all away!
no The problem is when the immigrant doesn't face any charges because they are here illegally.   My uncle was killed in aurora colorado. He was hit by an illegal alien who was driving drunk without a license. The courts commuted his ENTIRE sentence so that he could be deported. So he is probably in mexico drinking beers with his friends while my aunt and cousins have no father or husband.
no Thats right ask Nancy palosi how her wall helps her , the pope and so many MORE!!!!!
no We need to build that damn wall.  Those naysayers need to actually spend some quality time helping our boarder gaurds.
yes TRUMP 2020!!! May God bless our nation, and again!
yes I miss my aunty  Too have a good day love you lori
yes Linda Durbin really hard for Americans huh? Cuz i still see ooor and homeless sleeping on our street while its winter .
yes Poland loves the US President and his wife
yes Republicans in congress have no back bone.. old withering rich men. 0 miles have been built 2 years later, but amnesty has been granted to illegals sponsoring minors. Gtfoh
no Im disabled because an illegal took a short cut across a California highway. Not even deported, 7 different I.Ds. I got nothing and hes still driving around!!!!!!!
no Yes sir build the wall
yes No they aren't Palo. Show me the data and I'll show you why you're wrong.
yes I don't believe the lies and propaganda of the Democrats. They want to hold on so tightly to their power and are willing to destroy life for  America's citizens even if it means death.  Thank you President Trump for everything. Trump 2020!
yes 6 people died in a shooting yesterday
yes An illegal immigrant killed a friend of mine.  He was driving without a license and ran a stop sign.  My friend on his motorcycle hit the side of the van and was killed instantly.  He had no license, fictitious tags, and no insurance.  his wife was pregnant with their son who will never know his father.  NJ being a SHITHOLE sanctuary state did NOTHING about it!  He was arrested and released.  Build that wall before WE THE PEOPLE START KILLING THESE ILLEGALS!
no The overwhelming majority come in legally, overstaying visas, and through legal ports of entry other then Mexico.  A wall would prevent none of that - proper legislation, which lobbyists to both sides oppose, would.
yes Madeline Maisog Theetge Im sorry to hear, sending prayers for her
no Joseph Nowik Yeah-- like when Obama bypassed Congress and gave 150 billion dollars to Iran under the cover of darkness.  He declared 13 National Emergencies, all of which are still cooking the books.  Most corrupt and overreaching President in US history.
yes Maximus Herrera what exactly?
yes Hahaha MSM hahaha
yes To everyone saying you can't blame him because of his immigration status, why not? Yes technically it happened because he was drunk but imagine if he had never even been here in the first place? I completely support immigration, if you do it legally!!
yes Wendi DelValle   Sorry for your loss. Unfortunately Donald Trump's boondoggle of a wall would not have helped.  Let him open Pandora's Box. Remember, once you open Pandora's Box you can't close it.  Donald Trump. Go ahead and declare a National Emergency. One of two things will happen. Either you will lose in court. Or, the next Democratic president will declare a National Emergency for climate change, gun control, DACA, Health Care reform and middle-class tax cuts. Just to start with. 
yes Bill Johnson   You cant be serious. Trump caring about someone else other than himself. Once Trump got elected he stopped worrying about America and its people.  He got there votes and thats all he wanted. This man isnt concerned about individual people.  Its just not in his makeup to care for anyone at all
no John Garrison lol
yes https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dont-be-fooled-by-trumps-make-believe-crisis/2019/02/15/b66adc60-3158-11e9-8ad3-9a5b113ecd3c_story.html?utm_term=.93e683936b22
yes Jackie Lee Collins More People die from drugs than guns. Stop with the gun comparisons.
yes Finish that wall!!!
no you are dog ass stupid
no Samuel Tan Yuan Han Most illegal immigrants overstay their visas.. Hows a wall gonna address that issue?
yes George Winn they offered 45 25 billion in 2018. He couldnt art of the deal that?  Come on. Hes a loser.
no President Trump,  you need to have another meeting with the press or a news reporter & say,  Youve heard me talk about border security enough and just play videos of the past presidents and current politicians who supported the wall as recently as 2015  #buildthewall #Trump2020 
yes Build the wall...
yes https://www.facebook.com/15704546335/posts/10157841510401336/
yes Francisco Jess Guerrero Ibez
no The Liberals are inhumane people!
no There are American citizens in greater numbers carrying off mass shootings. Aurora the latest. Yet youve not called a gun control emergency. Crickets on your part.   Lets be realistic. If you wanted to protect American families youd do something about mass shootings. But being beholden to the NRA I guess you cant. All youre doing is playing the i love bring scared heart strings of your supporters.  Donald J. Trump
yes Dave Callender gave me a good laugh! Bravo!
yes I really love your pictures and I will like to be a friend 413-353-4927 I will like to hear from you soon
yes Worley Michael , say that up close, not behind a pc,
no Shelva Wensel TROLL let Check your IQ  Low Minded naive Brain Limited Trumpee
yes What about the CRAZY who killed 5 people yesterday?
no Build That Wall
yes http://www.harley-davidson.tk/?m=1
yes Damn right Donald. Screw these people who have no common sense and want to see our country destroyed. They are blind and have no damn sense. Go Trump go!
yes Jennifer Yvonne Croff
yes Kris Landers hyperbole? Seriously? Its not. Also, what are you trying to say about illegals? That you shouldn't befriend them because they will rape your children? That's not very tolerant of you, is it?
yes Thank you President Trump. Keep making us safe and a better country. Dont listen to ANY of the politicians. They are all self centered.
yes Haha sheeeeep. Thousands die everyday.but if you guys want to talk about people being murdered Just look ar all those school shooting by all them cocaians kids. But no one talk about gun reform. Man trump supporter are nothing but suckers and fools.
yes 2/3rds of illegals came here legally and overstayed their visas,  how's a wall going to prevent that ?
yes Asha Artis not American but wouldnt most of your illegal immigration problems stem from a broken security system? Im guessing most of them dont walk over the border but are not caught by the checks in place. Even if they walk over the border why arent they rounded up and sent back? Is it possible that there is corruption here, why are they so easily avoiding detection? A wall wont fix issues like these, get to the core of the issue, seems like a bandaid wall wont fix this.
no This  is  a  tragedy  but  what  about  all  the  people  killed  by  drunk  American  drivers?
yes Legal immigration is also destroying this country as most people just overstay. Shut it all down
yes BUILD THE WALL....lets get started...
no Get the wall built
no Working for America, Trump2020
no So sorry to hear of your loss. Mandy looks like a  sweet, wonderful person. We all mourn your loss. I only wish liberals/democrats could grasp the meaning of "securing our borders" for the SAFETY of all American citizens.
yes if my taxes go to building a wall it better be a wall around you and your supporters. there are plenty other things that need to be fixed over and before a wall and yet you ignore them congrats you don't care about america (mexico is america btw also canada as well you are thinking of the united states families not american families) you care about yourself
yes Correct. So why wouldn't we slow down the invaders. You want to immigrate here do it the legal way. Real simple.
no What about that drumf?  Ban alcohol?
yes Patrick Dixon they arent running here from Tijuana
yes May God Let Her Rest in Peace! Please the Wall!
no God bless you!!
yes Trump neglected to say when he described what a wall could do , he said they walk around it but forgot that they tunnel under
no https://youtu.be/egav1IFr5n0
no THE IPs (Infanticide Party members) are on a roll these days.  Supporting the murder of new born babies AND refusing to live up to their Constitutional oath to DEFEND AND PROTECT USA!  Maybe, if an IP had a family member killed by an illegal they'd realize it is a CRISIS!
no My deepest condolences to those familys who have lost love ones. Build the wall! #KeepingAmericaSafeTrump2020
no Thank you for fighting for America President Trump
yes 7 FACTS about immigration.  https://www.facebook.com/142474049098533/posts/2354864591192790/
yes One angel parent is no different than another. His grief is not greater than a parent who lost a child to a mass shooting. But lets rage in the streets! Not for both. I mean, fire arms are perfectly legal so we dont really care about THOSE angel parents. And if they try to speak out, well publicly humiliate them AND their live children just for shits and giggles. But by God we will rage for the ones killed at the hands of an illegal!! Gtfo with your fake empathy and compassion.
no Please Help Rohingya.
yes Sorry for your losses enough is enough time to protect America, Thank you President Trump.
no Jean-Franois Rivard WOW really like your DUMBASS works 7days a week without a off BITCH please. Stop being a ignorant ASSHAT.
yes Hahahahaha!! What did the EU stop you from doing then? #PoorOldBiffer #WheresTommeh :p
yes Trump you have our support stop those Democrats!! Dont back down...there are more supporters than not..
no So so sad and sorry for these families that have lost their loved one. Prayers
no I don't understand why the Democrats are against a wall - it's not about immigration - it's about letting people come into the country legally.  Chuck and Nancy are running their own agenda and not the agenda of the American People!
yes Donald Trump says his life was much better before he became president.  Believe me I truly understand.  My life was also better before he  became president.
yes Build the damn wall now!
yes WAR IS WONDERFUL WITH JESUS ON OUR SIDE! U.S. State Department approves $12 billion in military sales to Qatar, $8.2bn to Saudi Arabia, $50b to Israel and $1.4bn to Taiwan. America is the world's #1 arms dealer and has a military budget of $600 bn to Russia's $70bn!
no Leon Gerards Held
yes Wendi DelValle Im so sorry for your loss. Lets hope this wall gets built. Maybe it should be engraved with the names of all the lives that have been lost because we didnt have it.
yes Angela K Christensen You cant have national security without border security. Its not only necessary for any meaningful immigration reform; border security plays a crucial role in both the interdiction of illegal drugs and in defending America against criminal threats. Weak borders allow criminal and smugglers, as well as millions of illegal aliens, to have virtually free entrance to the United States.  If this was not true then why are there some 20 million ILLEGAL aliens living in the United States now, and why is there a drug epidemic killing thousands of Americans every year, and why are Americans being robbed and murdered by Illegal aliens.  Contrary to news reports the majority of these drugs are traceable to drug cartels in Mexico, not from pharmaceutical companies.
yes Ricardo Alfonso Saenz Jr.  your wall still wont be built
no Obama should of still been are present still.o ya.
no AMEN AND HALLELUJAH
yes Build that Wall....
yes Trump is a lying crook. If you believe what Trump says you're a SUCKER
yes James Chapman Yes I am already quite familiar with all of the Lies, Propaganda, and Fake News disseminated by the Central Fake News Agency operated out of the Oval Office and Trump Tower!!!
yes Go,go Don, build that wall mate. Wish we could in the UK.
yes Empathy!!!  What I see from Pelosi, Schumer, and other Democrats is a lack of empathy. My heart can feel that pain, I have family and children.  I cannot imagine to lose a child.  Yes, people have lack of empathy.
yes Why don't this matter to Peosi and Smuck?
yes Competition is key to competitive prices and work. When the people working don't care about their quality of work, they give out what they put into their work. Would you go to Walmart for all of your primary vehicle work to be done? Sure you will get a good job here and there but when you spend more at a different shop you will definitely have much better work done.
no You got this Mr President
yes While living in Chandler AZ...I was viciously raped by an illegal immigrant @ knifepoint in my own house after he broke in.
yes Don't ask it, you have already know it that d bitter truth 
yes None of those are good arguments however our underprotected border is a good argument and for all the reasons you just listed along with many others. Our gov is starting to deal with American problems yet we fight them....should be excited that we are trying to do something for America.and encourage it so that it may continue.
yes They have no right to be on American soil.  They do not respect the U.S. Then we have to pay for their babies.  Legals do it right.
no Sorry for the loss of your daughter.  This could of been avoided if there was a wall.
no Trumpsters cant handle truth can you..who's the looser dumb ass..
yes BEST President ever MAGA
yes Karl Hesford go to Chicago if you want the safty of gun control  !
no This is Fake news. I seen their faces on multiple marriage web sites. Why don't you talk about the American that just got fired from work and went back to kill multiple coworkers and himself
no Jeff Covington ...so far nothing seems to convince me of that...not because im closed minded either.
no An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
no How bout protecting their health and right to afford meidcation?
yes So sad America stands with President Trump
no Keep going President Trump
yes SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOST AND YES! FOR HER, FOR YOUR DAUGHTER, AND OUR DAUGHTERS AND SONS WE SHOULD, WE MUST, BUILD THE WALL ASAP!
yes Well Steve I've been called worse. I can live with that.
yes Build it Mr. President. For those saying think of what that money could do for vets and homeless, think about how much the 155 billion that we spend on illegals here could do for them. Stop illegal immigration stop the money bleed. The wall wont do it alone but it is part of the whole picture a piece of the puzzle that is greatly needed.
yes All these people that are coming into our country we are paying for their medical, education, food and their housing. We do not need any more people in this country I know I can't afford them. What other country can you go to who will pay for you to live there for free
yes BUILD THE WALL Donald J. Trump
yes It is not a problem that Americans kill Americans,  there is a big afraid  about a rare activity  .  NO  ONE  IS  ILLEGAL IN   A  STOLEN  LAND
no Sam Twal They already started here in Texas over a month ago. Come on down and see for yourself.
yes Syed Taqi talk about a STUPID thing to say. Wow. Smdh
yes Pretty sure you better build a wall around this guys forehead....good lawd
yes I am so sorry that you had to go through this traffic loss of your daughter. We will have our wall
no TYPING IN ALL CAPS MAKES EVERYONE FEEL IMPORTANT!!!
no Build that wall !! How do nuts like Nancy & Chuck have so much power that they can and DO stop America from being safe ?? And this Nancy woman lectures us about walls being immoral ??? She is a very sick person. Build that wall PLEASE ! I have kids, I want a country that still functions for them too !
no Maida Broadbent Williams is a dumbass Democrat.
yes Is there anyone alive who thought he wouldnt be leisurely eating & golfing today - on our dime - at his club - less than 24 hrs after declaring a national emergency?
yes Hal Bannasch you sir are an ass
yes Build it for the people that love this country
yes Jo Sechi
no Abdul Majid Legal! There is a difference
no All of the parents that loss kids to gun violence want their kids back too. Gun violence is a far greater danger to our country. Look up the two
no U should form a investgation on the deep state in are gov starting right in the doj n fb I...before they rig the election in 2020 Hope U listen to what am saying
yes Mr. President, keep up the great work! I'm totally behind you and support everything you have done and are doing for America! Finally, a President who cares for the well being, safety, and security of our country! Continue to stand strong, don't waiver, and keep on winning for America. We're not tired of winning yet!
no Cant believe how stupid he thinks we are! Some of us are capable of reading information from multiple sources, and critical thinking skills!
yes John N Karen Morris  sombody report me like that thanks to them now Im legal here jajajjaja
no Stupid wack. No but border wall is not a national emergency. Mass shootings are do not address again with your stupidity.
no An American just murdered 5 Americans and this is his focus
no Thank you Mr. PRESIDENT or doing what should have been done so long ago.  I do believe you love our country.  I dont know how you do it, but thank you.
yes White male gunmen gave killed more than anybody from Mexico   Parkland
yes I don't want to sound insensitive to your "chosen" example to support your platform or argument, but I think we need to talk about SUGAR.  We need to declare a state of emergency on that.  SUGAR is killing millions of Americans and stealing their teeth!!
no Jordan Miller wrong again. Had he not been here it would not have happened . Build the wall keep america safe. You people need to open yoyr eyes and take your rose colored glasses off. What a shame to see so many not wanting to pertect the american people. I am sure you and everyone elese has a fence or locks yoyr doors hey how bout shuts your doirs . Why do you have and do these things if walls dont work....
no Jim Villella Democrats dish out the same insults sadly.
yes I hope nobody invents tunnel technology.
yes Yes. I know what you mean. Time helps in some ways but not really. Every day without them gets harder too in many ways. It isn't like movies where it's a big emotional upset and then everyone moves on. Everyone around you has moved on but a big part of your heart is left in the past. Rachael was my dearest friend. I didn't know that until the night she died. The valley of the Shadow of Death is a dark place but there are so many wonderful people in there with us to encourage us along the way. It isn't a place we would ever choose to be, but here we are.
yes Guns kill more Americans in a month than illegals did in 10 years. Can we address that real national emergency tyrant?
yes Lost my son in El Paso due to illegal running red light hitting him walking across the street on his'way home from work. It was hit and run til his' girlfriend turned him in
no End of Democracy in USA.. so sad really.
no Chip Hauenstein agree
yes Far more homicides committed by regular Americans.
no Agree
no Danny Jones I feel for our British allies Elect a real leader thank Goodness President Trump was victorious or our culture be in the toilet also wheres Churchill when ya need him
no Betty Bilbrey 9/11 was an emergency. Waiting two years and not getting your way after a temper tantrum is not an emergency.
yes Commie run Hollywood pushes drugs and substance abuse in their movies. They set out to destroy nation states from within.
yes There are more important things like climate change, gun control and flint needs drinking water, just to name a few. There is NO emergency at the border!
no We need the WALL but I wish you would have torn up the spending bill! Pelosi will be going full bore out of spite now.
no Build that wall Donald
no So very sorry for your loss
yes Murder is murder, no matter the "status" of a person.
no Charlesetta Brown sooo....it was the same worst instincts while Bush , Clinton , and Onama were in office ? They pushed for it too...in their day
yes Gail Bailey Adams  I'm so sick of liberal stupidity.  Crime is a state issue.  This is a federal issue since it has to do with illegal immigration.   Stop voting Democrat, and your state will fair better.  Also, go back to school and educate yourself on state and federal issues.  You must have skipped government classes.
no Who is going to pay for the wall?
yes Mr.President America proud of you !!
yes This is all a joke, right?
yes Finish the wall
yes https://apple.news/AshdjozJ7TrWwla0EtHAtoA
no Mr. Donald John Trump our President Of The United States Of America never chose to be a common man. It is his right to be uncommon. He seeks the opportunity to develop whatever talents God gave him. Not security for his family. Security of the United States Of America. He does not wish to be a kept citizen. Humbled and dulled by having the state look after him. He wants to take a calculated risk: to dream and to build. To fail and to succeed. He refuses to barter incentive for a dole. He prefers the challenges of life to the guaranteed existence. The thrill of fulfillment to the stale calm of utopia. He will not trade freedom beneficence nor his dignity for a handout. He will never cower before any earthly master nor bend to any threat. It is his heritage to stand erect. proud and unafraid: to think and act himself, enjoy the benefits of his creations and to face the world boldly and say--This with God's help. I have done;'' All this is what It means to be an American.  God Bless America.  America First!!! Next big deal.  The State Of Jefferson. The Trump State. Soj51.org. It is time for 51
no Eva Graham Trump is an ass hole! Not to mention the "puppet" to PUTIN. TRAITOR TO AMERICA!!
yes I am so sorry for your loss..
yes Dave Sienknecht really, over 1100 came through an open area the other day.  That's one day.  Over 52,000 captured in December,  and those are the ones they caught.  Thousands more are in our country.  Illegal aliens come through open borders, and that is a fact.
yes I will say this; a barrier built on the borders will definitely help the situation. Dems that are against it, you can bet there're enclosed with a wall and massive iron gates and probably guards....What are they afraid of??? Okay; that's what the wall,barrier, is for. Security
no Support the wall yes absolutely agree with you.
no Alejandro Sanchez DRUGS! Not just the people.
no We need the wall
no Danny Jones so sorry for you guys
no Good morning & My best wishes to you both& yr family.Thanks for.remembering me & visiting here.
no No trust me the majority of us we feel for those Angel moms and one was too many this walls going up
yes Sorry for your loss sir.  True Americans are standing with our president to keep America safe.
no Kelli Annette Smith we are looking to lock up stupid people...what's your address. This is a about strange people sneaking in to hurt people....did ya see all those Angel Moms?? Did you see the families that didnt have to grieve?
yes What about the thousands who have been murdered by Americans who never should have been allowed a gun in the first place?
yes It already is addressed as it is illegal to drink and drive.
yes I don't feed into propaganda I have seen first hand. Walls do work they are built all the time for the purpose of stopping things.  if the wall is in place then we can focus towards what comes in through ports without the worry of it crossing over the border unprotected. I challenge u to take down one wall from the outside of your home apartment etc and you will see that walls work and that just because you don't see what can go in or out doesn't mean that it doesn't.
yes it,s going to take more then the wall
yes 20 six year olds died at Sandyhook Elementary school, all at once.
yes The sick idiots who are laugh reacting this post are the problem. Let's exchange them for legal immigrants. Give the immigrants all of their possessions, jobs, and money and send them to a shiihole counrty of their choosing.
no Robert Cee you're an idiot if you think you "don't need" Amazon.  How do you think you're going to afford The Green New Deal?  YOU CAN'T!  You progs are delusional socialist douches who like to confiscate OTHER PEOPLE'S wealth and use it how YOU see fit, like a dictator.  And  you couldn't survive without a safety net because da gubment is your daddy.  One other thing...if not for big business and tourism in NYC supporting you liberal takers NYC would be a giant slum.
yes SO SORRY. I Would BE SO ANGRY. THX FOR SHARING
yes Amen sorry for your lost
yes If a US military veteran with PTSD killed this man's daughter, would that make her death less hard to bear? Would he want veterans to be imprisoned behind a wall? If they were, would that make anyone any safer?
no https://youtu.be/6Km5O6T20zQ
yes GOOD  MAN.
no Illegal immigrant is a Russian that overstayed his visa
no Family is the most important happiness in life. Everybody wished to spend their life with families. Me too.
no People kill people every day. Illegal or not.
no It's totally ironic, that you fail to mention all the American citizens that die horrific deaths, at the hands of other American citizens. Such as all of the gun deaths that have been occurring. Why can't you step up and start dealing with all of the deaths by fire arms that are happening on a regular basis in this country !
no www.gofundme.com/thetrumpwall  Brian Kolfage
yes https://www.facebook.com/1478505579098739/posts/2383599701922651/
no First of all Nancy Pelosi took vacations twice instead of staying Wash.,DC to help solve the immigration problem  and therefore forced the gov't  to shut down. But the liberal Socialiatic Democrats see no problem that we pay her salary , she takes vacations on our money , doesn't  correct the out of control new young female Congresspeople. But opens her mouth continuously regarding our Pres. who stayed I. DC over the Holidays  to try to compromise with the  Socialistic Democratic obstructionists whose leader Pelisi was on vacation. So we the people allow our Pres.some R & R.
yes Nazi
yes David Monson 90 percent of drugs coming in from Mexico.
no Paul Karachia if we didn't have to spend over 100 billion every year on illegals, more could be spent to help the citizens! Walls don't work?  If you come to a wall you have 4 choices... Go over it, go under it, go around it, go back the same way you came.  Anything is better than nothing! Slow them down so border patrol can get there to apprehend.
yes What  about  the  thousands  killed  by  gun  violence
no I am not an American citizen, but I love what he stand for. God bless Pres. Donald J. Trump and God Bless  USA.the land of the Free.
yes Too bad the bill Trump signed allows DEM mayors and DEM municipalities to PREVENT the building of border barriers Provisions within the 1200 PAGE LONG bill make building a wall IMPOSSIBLE  thanks Republicans!
yes God saw fit to put a wall around Jerusalem as He does today in America
no Wendi DelValle Umm Im not trying to be a dick but what if it was someone else? Would you want a wall then?
yes Danny Jones you know what I want you to refund me the portion that goes from my taxes to this bloody wall because I don't want the pay for it.
no Build the wall!!!! Include California it!!!
no Sandy hook, San Bernardino, Parkland and just yesterday in Illinois?? So lets now focus on gun control!! Thank #45 for opening up national emergency - trump did set a precedent, there can now be real gun control via national emergency new guidelines just set!! Protection for all!!
yes so sorry for your lost
no https://youtu.be/zcNjW5NN9IE
yes I bet he is not a democrat.
no An illegal from El Salvador murdered my cousin, Destiny Tolodxi.   WE WANT THE WALL.   THAT IS DESTINY's WALL!!
yes He is trying to promote Nationalism which is biggest Face of the Devil
no Charlesetta Brown its waaaaay more than one plus them being here is a crime itself. Hence the name ILLEGAL
no Ron Gagnon so you're saying once the wall is built there be no more shootings no more deaths no more drugs in the United States. You're a fool and Trump is using scare tactics. There was just a murder yesterday no one has said one word about that that's because the guy was in the u.s. citizen he shot and killed five people and wounded five others
no We are spending so much money on illegal immigrants that a wall may not be such a bad idea at first I was pretty much against it but all the drugs are killing g so many people not to mention these immigrants get everything for free using taxpayers dollars yes maybe the money should be spent to help drug addiction or homeless or vets maybe we should have stricter laws for immigrants coming into this country I dont know if the wall will help but something has to give.  This country was built on immigrants only native Americans are Native American Indians but if u want to come to this country you should have to take the proper steps and come legally. My parents were legal immigrants and they never took any money from the government for help.  Im hoping that Trump is right and wall will help I just pray for unity and peace in our country
yes our own Tom Tillis voted for this horrible bill. Only 11 Republicans voted against this bill. What a sorry bunch of politicians. Republicans stabbing our President in the back.
no Build the wall now.
yes All you liberals need to shut up.  Build the wall and throw the liberals over it.
no Are we going to deport all the white locals who kill people? Road rage, mass shootings, etc? Immigrants commit far fewer crimes than native born Americans.
no Larry Fields, they are not all criminals just as all Americans are not criminals.  Not allowing those entrance who are seeking refuge or a better life is criminal!  Goodbye!
no Jesus.  His followers are so simple minded.
no Jim Butkowsky thats just if if that illegal person had not been here her daughter would be alive. #buildthewall
yes George Winn I still say it shouldn't be an emergency.  He's president, not dictator dude. He doesn't get to dictate policy.  Congress passed a bipartisan bill and Congress decided his wall isn't needed. He needs to suck it up, put his big boy pants on, and stop thinking he is a dictator and realize he won't always get his way and acting like an asshole all the time guarantees more often than not he won't.
yes Make sure nobody has guns in America, or at least they are registered and they are not assault weapon. Who  needs assault weapons in a peaceful country ?
yes She is so beautiful! Why why why ?
no Kylie Owen
yes The financial records of Every Politician who oppose border security needs to be openly investigated and made public! Those who scream the loudest should be investigated first! You dont oppose security unless you are profiting from it!
yes I can't imagine how it must feel to have lost your child to an invader and to have all the media and the US Congress care more for the invaders, than your child.   And then the one man who has shown any concern, the President of the US, betrays you by signing a bill that will flood the country with more illegals.  Shame on you Mr. President, shame on you for signing that atrocious bill.
yes Patti Cullen You confuse Trump with Obama. He thought he was above everyone and everything.
yes "...what about all ..."  This or that? How about enforce the fucking laws.  That's should be the common theme.
yes Americans buy the drugs. Who is the problem? Lol
no Yes Obama sent billions to Iran to build a wall!!! We weren't made aware of it but it was his parting gift to the hard workers of America
no Carol Starr my government turned their backs a long time ago I think.
no The wall must be built.
yes Eduardo Mendoza Is because of the savagery that some mexican people have in their blood, those Mexicans are also disliked in Mexico.
yes Charlesetta Brown yes, Obama had 8 quarters that had over 3% GDP.  The other 24 were horrible and he never had 3%+ annual GDP.   Obama pumped money into the economy.  He invested how many billions into green companies?  Almost everyone of them was bankrupt within six months.     Obama had unemployment going down yet at the same time so was job market participation rate, it hit a 40 year low.  People were not finding jobs, they were just getting taken off the roles.   Obama lowered taxes?  The Supreme Court ruled that the ACA was a tax, this giving Obama the largest tax increase in the history of the US.
yes Kris Landers , they already do hold others responsible. In Drunk driving accidents not only does the driver get sued but also the bar and the server. Same thing for house partys.
yes It's a shame you have to do all this for something that  as everyone can see is wrong do they not see the gangs in California or the pictures of the drugs that's caught at the border not just because you in office you the one trying to fix this...it's crazy they want it to stay the same....Do Americans care about America?
no Kerry Gay this family spoke about needing a wall.  So, he isn't using anyone.  You're very ignorant.  The cities who have the strictest gun control has the highest gun violence.  Crime in your state is up to your state, this is a federal government problem of protecting its borders. Please, try researching before speaking, because you definitely are ignorant in many areas, and ignorance is unbecoming!
yes What about all the people who come in through our airports on a tourist visa and overstay?
no An American killed my cousin when he was vacationing with his wife and kids in Fort Lauderdale Florida. He was crossing the street on a green light and this 24-year-old entitled drunk young  American women ran a red light and struck him. When the cops finally caught up with her she told me when I identified her in a line-up: "this is America and if you don't like it leave". I totally agree we need the wall to keep entitled Americans in and keep everybody else out. Let's make America safe again so that Americans can kill each other and not the rest of the world.
yes Timothy Kershner Illegal's do NOT belong in this country...let alone killing ANYONE...
yes Shut up youre annoying !!!
no Thank god!! about time!! I would pay for the wall myself if i had the money!!!
no Nazik Davoudian Zargarian they don't care a out anyone. Just votes! Using illigals to vote!
no Build the wall and take it all the way up the east side of California!!
yes But how do you expect to build something you came unprepared for. Where exactly is the funding for said wall coming from. Because it sure as hell not coming from the Democrats and it sure is hell not coming from Mexico. And its sad how youre making people suffer just because youre not getting your way. Only if you were real president and thought about the American people and didnt only think about yourself.
no Wheres them walls??
no Sad that you lost your daughter . I am praying something can be done in her name to ease the pain. Like building a wall so no one else will suffer at the hands of illegals .
no I JUST STARTED A LOVE TRUMP GROUP PLEASE JOIN SHOW SUPPORT FOR HIM TRUMP I HOPE TO GET MANY PEOPLE TO JOIN MY GROUP
no Go Donald!!!
yes I'm so sorry. I pray you will somehow be able to survive all the heartbreaking dynamics of  this absolutely horrible loss of your precious son. The Democrats have gone mad, and this is causing us so much grief and worry. My heartbreaks for you and your family, and I pray for you all and our country.
yes Carl Ostendarp On the guns there is a minor stumbling block for fools like you - its called THE CONSTITUTION!  I hope you know what that is! And your thought isnt new, you are just repeating the usual canned lying liberal talking points!
yes Terri Reeves well I dont know much about Chicago but I know that here, in Canada, there are probably only as much murders in a year than in Chicago alone, maybe less
no Mary L. Zweber  well, its all about the money.
no I am so sorry killing your Daughter!
no Danny Jones the life you enjoy now came through the exploitation of overseas colonial territories especially Africa and so you dont want to share what was stollen
yes BUILD THE WALL MR PRESIDENT!!!!!!! GOD BLESS YOU AND ALL YOU DO FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
no Anyone with any common sense or lives close to a border knows we need to build a wall and protect our country
yes Keep Trumpin Mr. President! We love you and stand behind your plan! You make us PROUD!
yes Sad thing is the Democrats don't care !  Vile !
no Being run over by an American is much better.
no However stats have proven over and over again that citizens commit way more crimes than illegals. I would think many of the illegals that do come here also get their guns here since it's so easy to do so. However I am against illegal immigration but the majority of our mass shootings are caused by white American citizens. President Obama deported more illegals than any other president. It's not the crisis that Trump's conning his base to believe. Stats show immigration from the southern border is the lowest in 50 years. Many of the suspected terrorist that have entered this country, came through Canada. Trump is conning his base lmao
yes Brought us out of a recession.  That's why he was elected again
no Ed Wrany One angel family does not a crisis make!!!!  Trump declares national emergency...  Nobodys done the job that weve done on the border,  said Donny as he declares a national emergency today........the slowest emergency in history.  And with the lawsuits that will ensue, his wall will not be funded or built until after the next election...if ever.  THE WORLDS SLOWEST EMERGENCY!!!!!  Donny lied directly to Americans about his border crisis.  Our Liar-in-Chief said that all the data that refutes his crisis designation is lies.  Got that?  Our president told the American people that THE FACTS ARE LIES...this is what all wannabe dictators say.  This egomaniac is THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!  Donny doesnt seem terribly concerned about this crisis.  He plans to travel to Florida mere hours after declaring the emergency from the White House. A president, in times of strife, would typically stay in the nations capital to oversee the crisis. Donny plans to do so from the comfort of his weekend getaway.  In reality, Donny is preparing the country for a fake war as he plans to enjoy a mini vacation. The only national emergency in America right now is one of leadership!!
yes Thank You President Trump!
no WE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM IN SOUTH AFRICA OF KILLINGS INOCENT PPLE..
yes I am neither a builder or scientist or whatever== WOULD IT BE FEASIBLE TO PUT SOLAR PANELS ON SECTIONS OF THE WALL?  If possible and Mexico would like to help pay every other panel could face South and both countries could benefit.
yes Kerri Siegler Stockin you live in the city with the most crime of anywhere in the country. None of them are immigrants there
no I totally agree especially here in California where the criminals have more right than the victims.
no Look an Angel Mom or Dad in the eye and tell them this is not an Emergency, Democrats suck....
yes Sam North yup
yes the democrats dont care they want the vote but the demos are very stupid the people coming in are going to vote for their own like in new york and minn   such stupid people in thes country
yes So sorry for your loss yes we must build the wall it Hass to be done
yes Sincerest prayers sent to the family of this lost woman, but using this story as justification for the wall is down right dumb.  Anyone could have been behind the wheel of that car, it doesnt matter who it was. There are drunk drivers all across America, so are we just gonna build walls around their houses to keep them off our roads too? This sounds a lot like a lot of arguments against vaccinations I hear too. Saying well so and so died and she had shots therefore vaccines are bad for you is very comparable. This woman could have been struck with or without the wall, it just so happens to be that the man was an illegal immigrant, and therefore people are using it.  Honestly, the logic behind a lot of such issues amazes me, not just the wall.
yes BINARY OPTIONS ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT.. Binary options trade has been developing rapidly over the last few years, This innovative approach to global markets allows people to quickly invest and extract profit from their investments without actually buying the asset that interests them. It is the price of these assets that is the focus of attention when dealing with binary options and the only thing people have to do is predict whether it will rise or fall in a certain period of time (Up or down). these are the only two things traders have to worry about, It was never so easy to become a successful trader all you need for success in binary options trading is a well approved broker to invest your money and get back profit in a week time. Your broker plays this role and point you in the right direction from the beginning of trade right up to the cashout of your profit. With a minimum investment of $300 you can make good profit of $3500 and $500 will earn you a profit of $5500 after a trading week.  If you're a newbie or a trader who has been loosing a lot of money recently you can contact me for more info on how you can go about the trading process.
yes China and berlin had a wall and look how that turn out
no What is going to keep us safe from the crazy misguided Democrat's? They are trying to tear up the constitution with one hand and trying to use it as a weapon with the other. They are the greatest treat to our republic.
yes SO SORRY.
yes An illegal immigrant gave me a blow job once while on vacation in Mexico it was excellent!!!!!!!! She didnt speak English and I didnt speak Mexican but she was beautiful and understood American currency. Overall a excellent cleaning lady on my all inclusive vacation
no i think it shoild be publicized in any venue that people know how drugs, guns, illegals, children are smuggled in to the USA.  might be enlightening as alot of people (if they 1st believe theres at so border problem) might thinkg alot of this stuff comes across in a standup, oiutmfront, inyour face manner, THINK AGAIN=these coyotes or whatever are real resource full.  USA.   
yes Dummycrats for prison 2019
yes Wait wasn't mexico paying for the wall?
yes Kevin Marquardt. Honey that is what LADDERS  and SHOVELS  are for. We need hi tech equipment and more security. Walls are outdated and can be breached, this is 2019 . There are better ways,  I am for new ways not a trumpty  vanity wall .  Another question,  why isn't Mexico paying  for it???? Hmmmm
yes White and Black American citizens killed tens of thousands of Americans. Where is THAT wall going to be built?
no Timothy Kershner  So that makes it OK ?
yes That's true go ahead Mr. President and If you want   let me know please
yes Mitch Haynie just like if Ted Bundy wasn't here right? Just like if Rudolph wasn't here right? The facts are the criminals are a dime a dozen like always. The majority of us are law abiding, and just fucking work to pay bills. You've all got some lazy ass, shitty no good criminals, in all your families as well. Should that label your entire family as criminals, or just the asshat who committed the crime? So entitled you are 
yes Sue Carol AND he decided during this frantic crisis that NOW is the best time to upgrade his golf simulator AND jet off to MarALago right after admitting the emergency isnt an emergency.
no Why do the Trump cultists always call people names? Are they 5 years old?
no To all of you Angel Families, my heart breaks for you because this never should have happened! God Bless you, God Bless our President and stand strong to support our country!
no Alex J Rod hes not building the wall with his own hands. He did what he needed to do. Do you ever do anything relaxing on your weekends or do you just work seven days a week?
no QUEEN WAS NEVER MY MOTHER OK MARGRET ROBSON AMEN 2001
no Exactly president you must stand to build the wall you need to protect the innocent american victime by the crimina illigal allien from othet countries pouring in here in the usa
no I am very sorry and I respect everyone who has been hurt by a illegal immigrant but the killing in SandyHook,Park land, and others school have been by people who are born here or are here llegal the wall is not going to put a end to people coming in but wait a minute who works from sunrise to sunset to pick up our fruits and vegetables that no one wants to pick up so that we can eat.Bad people come in all sizes and colors and from all over the world so don't get caught up in this game trump is playing on this nation because we would not be great if everyone who has done a little here and a little there wouldn't have helped us by the way they also come in from others places and nation and trump only picks on the Mexican border he should be grateful that his parents were not sended back to wherever they come from because it can also be said that  they were illegal immigrant too.
no The wall is a great start but,....without guards WITH "use deadly force", orders the wall will not be effective.

yes A 5 billion dollar investment to save 150 billion a year Build it Use the bill passed by the democrats in 2013
yes Re: Aurora. I could ask? Why so many murders in or near Chicago, in spite of strict gun laws?   And was does that have to do with wall, and the border, which is a completely different issue. There is no connection, or solution, common to the two.
no Charles Boyd Didnt they do that in Chicago, I heard it worked great lololol
no How about those people being killed by citizens. Should the build a wall around the whole United States? Stupid ass pendejo!!!
yes Build the wall and make Democrats pay for it.
yes John Gardner California  LARGEST INSANE ASYLUM IN THE WORLD  Interesting that the LA Times did this. All the others are staying away from it. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, this should be of great interest to you!  Just One State - be sure and read the last part...  try for 3 times.  This is only one State... If this doesn't open your eyes, nothing will!  From the LA. Times:  1. 40% of all workers in LA County (10.2 million people) are working for cash; and not paying taxes. This is because they are predominantly illegal immigrants, working without a green card. (Donald Trump was right)  2. 95 %of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens.  3. 75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens.  4. Over 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers.  5. Nearly 35% of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals; they are here illegally.  6. Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages.  7. The FBI reports half of all gang members in Los Angeles are most likely illegal aliens from south of the border.  8 Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal.  9. 21 radio stations in LA are Spanish-speaking.  10. In LA County, 5.1 million people speak English; 3.9 million, speak Spanish. (There are 10.2 million people, in LA County.  (All 10 of the above facts were published in the Los Angeles Times)  Less than 2% of illegal aliens are picking our crops, but 29% are on welfare.  Over 70% of the United States' annual population growth, ( and over 90% of California, Florida, and New York), results from immigration.  Also, 29% of inmates in federal prisons are illegal aliens.  We are fools for letting this continue.  HOW CAN YOU HELP?  Send copies of this letter, to at least two other people.  To 100, would be even better.
yes Walls do work
yes Bill Johnson   You should be saying make America sane again.  Not to worry,  With proper therapeutic intervention you will some day come to terms with the realization of having betrayed your country at the ballot box, handing it over to a Russian crime syndicate headed by a mentally and emotionally damaged New York City gangster.
yes Charlesetta Brown please provide the name and address of your loved one for the next death cause by an illegal!!
yes Kevin Peevey  no... that won't stop natural US citizens from drinking and driving and causing fatal accidents... it's only a news story because he was an illegal immigrant... if it was a white guy it would have been a completely normal occurrence
yes https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1690237991078876&id=443476065755081  Even Pelosi said so before her party affiliation was bigger than her American.  Straight from the ass' mouth.  Hmm.

Now I know you will do the same with Melania's Family who got in via Chain Migration again because your a fair President and not the self serving hypocrite that anyone with an ounce of intelligence knows you are.   MAGA.
yes Our country isnt a house and one of the main functions of walls is to retain heat.
no Tony Palmer in fact, the wall encourages immigrants to stay. Otherwise they would return home yearly. Now they are stuck here.

yes Protect us from vacinnes injuries too!!
no Trump I support this build the wall finish the wall crime will fall!!
yes there are criminals everywhere, some illegals other legals, other born here or anywhere, Timothy McVeigh killed many people and he was not illegal, yet some of his ancestors came  here probably from Europe without the consent of the real Native Americans, the real owners of this land, and this land was taken from them using force, lies and genocide. Immigrants move across the whole word for different reasons, some are bad people, other have PTSD but most of them want a better life. So dont  put things out of context to make your point. all crimes are bad, but  show the data where it say most crimes are committed by illegals.
yes Brandon Turner it won't  bring her brother back but it will save someone else's brother. BUILD THE WALL

no Paul Karachia ever climbed a wall?
no Tell that to the ranchers on the border whose property and homes are invaded regularly by illegals.
no And enforce e-verify.  Let the activists and lawyers who have gained by the issues help Mexican citizens to do it right!
no if the wall would only save 1 life...yours...i'd still fight for it
yes and yesterday a US citizen killed five people and a year ago 17....and everyday citizens are killed by guns....why aren't they as important as this girl? Why are you not asking for money to address the real concerns in the US?
yes Linda Durbin oh yea sure, working hard... what action did he take after the Las Vegas massacre? Thoughts and prayers? 
no Feb 15th at 11:00 am. I sent my 2 letters to the psychiatrist saying i do not consent to abilify cause of adverse drug reaction and the other that i will further discuss with the media if she continues with other meds. All day noone came to pick me up to take me to the hospital. If it was such a concern i would have been in again. Postponing my review panel until i get another lawyer this time low income. Unless they decide its not worth it anymore. They wasted my time with bs. I need to work! Back to work tonight thank god! Dont worry Donald justice will prevail!
yes My mom was hit by an illegal immigrant and he tried to drive off. He pulled out in front of her and totaled her car. On another occasion my dad was hit by one going the wrong way and drunk on the highway. Totaled his car and hurt him pretty bad.

yes Is it means an iligal spanish ???
no Undocumented immigrant receives Medal of Honor for his actions in combat and is beaten with a baseball bat when he returns home. On Nov. 27, 1944, squad leader Macario Garcia and his platoon were pinned down in Germanys Huertgen Forest, under intense mortar and machine-gun fire. In the unrelenting barrage of the Nazi attack, several of Garcias men were killed or wounded. Garcia himself was hit in the shoulder. He crawled toward nearby underbrush as a machine-gun and various riflemen attempted to finish him off. Garcia was wearing the uniform of an American G.I. He was wearing the dog tags of an American GI. He was leading a squad of American G.I.s. He was not, however, an American citizen. Garcia was an undocumented immigrant. For his actions in the Huertgen Forest  taking out two machine-gun nests single-handedly while seriously wounded, saving the lives of his men and advancing the American position  Macario Garcia was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. Upon entering a diner only one month after his return to the United States, dressed in full uniform with combat medals, he was refused service because of his race and beaten with a baseball bat and arrested. https://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/What-if-Houston-war-hero-Macario-Garcia-had-been-12815055.php
no Jennifer Smith let me guess u r proud of the ladies in white....baby killer club
yes Yes even though more white Americans kill or injure people than any other race....
no No need for basic logic huh?
yes Make love on guns .I dare you .in fact if your sooo convinced .then rather than use government forces to enforce your views come take my guns yourself
yes And yet, Nancy won't meet with Angel Moms or Dads. I hope America remembers that!
no Right cause illegal immigrants are the only ones who kill people drinking and driving.
no The Murdering Illegal needs to lose his life.
no I think Pelosi is head and shoulders kinder and a better leader than Trump! Let Nancy Pelosi give us the tools to give fair and honest border protection. Trump made a big noise with his big mouth and I don't really appreciate or much need his work.
yes Tara Letourneau Exactly it's logical and preventative, a safety measure.
yes Doing what's needed to have been done for DECADES....
yes Ask Nancy Pelosi, the wall around her home works well.
yes But Ruto will never be president.
yes If you ask the American citizens on the border they will say otherwise
yes Wrong, manbaby! People will ALWAYS find a way around the wall. Too many ways...
no Nothing sadder than a woman supporting an abusive man.
no Allyson Stuhlmiller 24 years old
no Thank  you president  for keeping us safe
no Absolutely agree
no And Americans kill each other on a daily basis,like the killings today.
no And as a UK tax payer you know that we pay a lot to the UK but we also get funding back don't we ?
yes Following this logic, shouldnt you be focusing on common sense gun laws, affordable healthcare for all including prescription medications,  the opioid crisis, and livable wages for all? The family youre using to politicize this issue have suffered an unspeakable and horrific tragedy - just like all of the families in the mass shootings have along with all of the families that lost loved ones due to being priced out of medical treatment.
no Hal Eric Mitlitsky With any luck that won't be for AT LEAST another 5 years. Hopefully more.
yes A US Worker allowed my son's wheelchair to roll off of a loading dock because they didn't put the brake on, he could have been impaled with this wheelchair tray but thankfully only ended up with 7 stitches in his head and scars on his hands where the skin was scraped off.
yes President Trump do you have a response to the Speaker of the House and Diane Feinsteins threats of a Civil War yo disarm law Abiding Americans citizens?
yes He's a minute man. I am sure he killed a lot of immigrants. Or allowed them to cross over the border with out properly identifying the immigrants. So where's the justification in that?
no Eva Graham. Agreed
yes Sharon Fantana    Are you really that ignorant?  The Wall works for Israel....use common sense (but I dont think you have any).
yes So sorry for your loss. God comfort you and family.
yes Stewart Schaniel guns are not being taken away just laws to make sure they are in the right hands. Because remember guns do not kill people but people kill people. We need mental health checks, and training and awareness. These are the laws that need to be in place. It is called common sense gun laws.
yes Not illegal immigrant. ILLEGAL ALIEN
no So sad Go Trump BTW
no Idiotic.
yes The devil goes about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. Don't sell your souls.  It is way past time to declare a national emergency to get the God-hating, man-hating, freedom-hating, America-hating, Trump-hating, power-loving cancers out of our government.
yes That's not very Christian of you cunt
yes Leon Rackauskas so you dont care about the other 143 police officers killed by the general population
no Michael Thompson  yes!! But Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher.
no Emily Neal so more gun laws that criminals wont obey, got it
no .. https://www.foxnews.com/us/illinois-workplace-shooting-leaves-5-dead-shooter-killed-officials-say
no 1 anerican is to many
no People dont realize that more Americans kill Americans than anyone else. Why isn't that being talked about? I live in El Paso. That stretch of road is known to have deadly accidents. It just so happened that this individual was an immigrant. However if it were to be any other driver, it would fit the propaganda, but here we are. The dad of the victim is even writing about walls in newspapers. Why not argue about slowing down the speed limit at that stretch of road? Why not argue that the city should install more security features? No. Your go to solution - only because this man is an immigrant - is to build a 5.7 billion wall. A wall which btw already exists in El Paso, where this happened. Yet, it still happened. Bet you didnt even know that info. Hell, I bet even after learning this info, you'll turn a blind eye and argue something random about a wall. Just think about your own hatred for a second. You're brainwashed and dont even realize it.
no What about all the civilians, that were born here, killing each other?   Theres larger issues than what you bring to the table don.
yes Pay attention please.    Experts have reported that  "The Wall "  will not keep out illegals.  Therefore, the 8 billion dollars that Trump wants for a wall  will be in addition to the amount paid out for Medicare, Medicaid and food since the Wall will not be effective.    Most illegals overstay VISAs or they come in through legal points of entry.
no What experts Ron O'Hearn?
yes President Trump, I am so thankful you are our President. Thank you and your wonderful family for working so hard for us. All of you are in my prayers.
yes Curtis Rice 2020 !!!!!
yes You are right and I am always on your side.
yes shut the hell you ignorant pussy grabber backer this is exactlly what you all done to President Obama so suck it up butter cup
yes Crime has no color. Hate and resentment only bring more turmoil. Trust in God. Not in a wall or Trump.
yes James Brubaker  Okay just did, here are all the articles that showed up about BORDER AGENTS in Texas and their views on Trumps imaginary crisis.  You resorting to insults of me and my heritage display your complete inability to participate in any informed discussion and any further attempts on my part will clearly fall on your deaf ears. I just hope someone does a complete search of their views after seeing this information.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/qz.com/1520651/border-patrol-agents-in-texas-showed-trump-why-his-wall-wont-work/amp/  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/texas/amp/Texas-border-communities-cringe-as-Trump-sounds-13518898.php  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.chron.com/news/politics/amp/Texas-congressman-calls-Trump-border-remarks-13539330.php  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.haaretz.com/amp/world-news/border-agent-explains-to-trump-why-a-wall-won-t-solve-the-problem-1.6831070
yes Emily Neal let me continue your story.  So, after he's denied a gun at a store, he buys one off the streets and shoots up a school anyway..  problem not solved.
no It's a sad day in America when we lose a life to someone who shouldnt be here! Even sadder when you know that the very people standing in the way from making it stop are right there with a rebuttal of national emergency on gun violence..I wont get started on what I think...(event are very coincidental and I dont believe in coincidence) They only care about their votes and are hanging American citizens out to dry!  Wake up America, we are being destroyed from within!
yes After running as a reformer, selling out your supporters and patronizing the dem and rep pty- see Omnibus spending bill
yes Build the wall immediately
yes More propaganda
no Let's see a person with a gun walks in to public and opens fire. Democrats are like ban all guns. Yet a person enters our country illegally and commits a crime. Dems are like... Give them benefits. But no dont do anything to control the problem. #speakingoutofbothsidesofyourmouth #prioritieswhatsthat
yes I live in Southern California a little west of Palm Springs and I say any City or State that becomes a Sanctuary City or Sanctuary State, thereby not enforcing Immigration Law, now can NOT enforce ANY Law. No one can be arrested for rape, robbery, assault, murder, etc., because that would be picking and choosing which Laws to enforce and which Laws to not enforce. The Employers who hire illegals, the Judges, Congressmen, Prosecutors, Mayors, Governors, and Church-Sanctuary People of those cities and states should be held accountable and arrested as accomplices for aiding and abetting illegals, and endangering the lives of United States Citizens. Yes, it IS that simple.
no Gus Keller Um, it's a public phone number, doesn't make us snitches. We actually don't know anyone here illegally. We have helped people achieve legal status over the years. Not a snitch, just believe "Don't do the crime, if you can't do the time." - From the Wife.
yes A warrior. Unless it's raining. Or if his bone spurs aren't acting up.
yes President Trump has my full support. Build that wall!

yes https://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/my-white-friend-asked-me-on-facebook-to-explain-white-privilege-i-decided-to-be-honest-20170809
yes Yes, OK...BUT, we also need to take Sanctuary Cities, completely off the CHARTS...IT'S A INSANE IDEA......
yes Because the father of the slain daughter is agreeing we need it is totally political.
yes Lisa Mann Not if you have military patrols on top of the wall complete with towers, gun turrets & fully equipped resource centers that the troops/ICE can use.  Israel's border wall does it's job quite well, I haven't lost a friend to a suicide bombing in over 10 years.
yes The border is 2000 miles long what's 200 miles of wall going to do really?
yes Ask all The elitists to tear down the walls around their homes. Lets see how many do.
yes Ashton Thompson Pearl Brown Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR

yes Question about any one that believes walls wont work do prisons deploy walls anyone Ive ever seen does I surely dont see criminals running wild
no Abdul Majid Try to be informed rather than just opinionated. Smh
no Thank You, Mr President.
yes When I ask my self this question. About the wall. And weight out all the pros and cons. I came up with this.  I had a daughter. That was involved in. Human trafficking. She did not even know she was doing it. Because of the drugs and the influence. It had on her. She call us. And wanted to come home for a few days. I knew she was a prostitute. And it was hard to just think that some day Im going to get a phone call. From the police. Saying your daughter is dead. In my heart. Was a broken heart. To think what she was doing. She was MIA. Then out of the blue she called. I asked her questions. How are you. When are you going to come home. She would not say nothing. Out of shame. I would begin to cry. She would say dad dont cry. This is my choice. So I asked her this. What are you doing right now.  She told me. She was at the bus stop. To pick up some girls. From New York. I asked why. Because her pimp wanted her to. I told her. That is human trafficking. She said whats that. And I told her. What human trafficking is. And what happens to girls. She took the girls to a safe house. And she had to stay with them until the pimps. Muscle guys. Came and took him away. She told me they were 12 to 15-year-olds. She never saw those girls again after that night when the muscleman came and took them.  If a wall just stops one of these acts and prevent someone from getting killed from drugs to me its worth having the wall. If they cant come to America legally then they should not come at all does it read those their grandparents or someone they know that wanted to come to America had to either come here legally or illegally. Lives matters. And walls will save lives.
yes GOD S NOT HUMAN. How does he become a child ? Who created Mary. you don't think !!!      Kuran CHAPTER 5 maide verses116 And Allah will say, "O Jesus son of Mary, did you say to the people, `Take me and my mother as gods rather than Allah?'" He will say, "Glory be to You! It is not for me to say what I have no right to. Had I said it, You would have known it. You know what is in my soul, and I do not know what is in Your soul. You are the Knower of the hidden 117  I only told them what You commanded me: that you shall worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them while I was among them; but when You took me to Yourself, You became the Watcher over themYou are Witness over everything.        THE TORAH AND THE  BBLE ARE THE BOOK OF ALLAH.   BUT WAS CHANGED LATER. QURAN CHAPTER  2 BAKARA VERSE 79  So woe to those who write the Scripture with their own hands, and then say, "This is from Allah," that they may exchange it for a little price. Woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they earn.   GOD S NOT HUMAN. HOW DOES HE BECOME A CHLD? GOD S ONE. AND GOD S ALLAH. AND ALLAH S ONE. AND REAL S ONE. AND NEVER AND NEVER DONT CHANGE.  QURAN CHAPTER  3 AL- MRAN VERSES 59  The likeness of Jesus in Allah's sight is that of Adam: He created him from dust, then said to him, "Be," and he was.   60  The truth is from your Lord, so do not be of those who doubt.   https://www.quranwow.com/#/ch/1/t1/ar-allah/t2/en-itania/a1/alafasy-64/a2/itania-64/v/2     Quran sure 3 al-i imran 19  Religion with Allah is Islam. Those to whom the Scripture was given differed only after knowledge came to them, out of envy among themselves. Whoever rejects the signs of AllahAllah is quick to take account.  AND  85  Whoever seeks other than Islam as a religion, it will not be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers.
yes BUILD THE WALL MR. TRUMP.
yes For those who think there's no problem at the border...lend me your ear for a first hand story we heard today.  My son's  truck was stolen in San Antonio. Two weeks later they found it in Larado.  The sheriff said the seats are missing.  They take them out to fit more people to bring them across the border. They like the 4 wheel drives so they can drive through the ranches.  He said they get 200 stolen cars a day like this. Not 2 but 200!!! Multiply that by as many as they can stuff in the truck without any seats. Now multiply that by 365 days in a year.  Now tell me there's  no problem at the border and I will tell you you're crazy. Build the wall!!! I'm over it!!
yes It isn't a damned competition you myopic virtue signaling troll! Illegal border jumpers are not supposed to be here, FULL STOP!  By your logic lets let them in because we already have mass murderers?! That is really a very special kind of stupid, princess!
yes Right wing Trump supporters have killed over 50 on school and public area mass shootings. We need to deport all Trump supporters and impeach/remove Trump
yes Naomi Samuelson why??
yes Yes we should
no Is the not the land off the free cus it dont look like that to me
yes #LAME guess we'll move ya out of Georgia & send ya across border when it's done to let ya see how they're
yes One illegal????You better get some facts together.
no Instead to put Joaqun "El Chapo" Guzmn (The drugs dealer in prison for life time and cost the tax payer paid for his accommodation for life time, I have a good idea, Why not Joaqun "El Chapo" Guzmn paid to pay for the wall with a lots of extra money for his freedom
no Mike Caffes if you can find one then contact your local police department and give them the evidence.
no Linda Durbin  You mean golfing so hard
no trump is a moron. how many angrys can i get for this?
yes Patti Cullen, picking on the wrong President for that. Obama was definitely the one that thought that.
no "The only national emergency is that our president is an idiot"  Ann Coulter
yes Lisa Fuller no they smart , YOU low minded and naive. Greetings from the free World with a free Press and Moral and Ethics and Human Values and Social Responsibility for all People BLACK WITHE BROWN GREEN GREY or BLUE
yes Trump is right, Build the Wall Now...

yes Chip Thornton  Yes they do.
yes https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2019/01/10/there-is-no-border-crisis/#67ccd8cd6a52
no Absolutly
yes We need to start by getting the Democrats out of office !
no Danny I wasnt aware that being trash was an actual culture. The more you know
no Republicans are murdering exponentially more people by denying the affordable health care and drugs than people being killed by illegal aliens. I'm sure most killings by illegal aliens are domestic or murders of people they know. Illegals aren't running around shooting people for the hell of it. But stupid Trump followers believe what ever the orange toad tells them.
yes If you're so worried about people killing people, please build a wall all around America.
yes on and on-yes we have a national emergency- BUILD THE WALL
no Only America haters are against the Wall.
yes Melissa Lamphere so what you're saying then is you want to foster/sponsor a family of illegals? Now remember no background check of any kind. Just open your door. Let'em right in to your home. I love how awesome of a person you are.
no Everybody knows it is normal for Human Beings to loath someone like Trump that constantly lies to them like the vast majority of Americans do!!! So why does the Trump Cult so easily accept Trump's constant lying to them??? That is very abnormal! .......though of course Cult's throughout history have always excepted this disgraceful behaviour from their false idol!!!
yes Sorry for your loss, Them people in Texas are being paid to stop the wall.  Do you know how many millions Soros, Clintons and the cartel are going to loose in drug money with the wall.  What people are doing to our kids is despicable
yes Is there any data on how common this is?
yes So Im guessing its ok if the murderer was from America? Well thats who is committing the majority of murders here. Americans.
yes Trump prison 20 to life
yes ohh Jess still in the mood ,,Us and Them,,. Like they are subhumans. Even if some of Them are responsable for terorist atacks like in Paris 2015 ,Madrid 2003 or London 2005 we Europeans still living in relative peace with Them. Them = ilegal imigrants as u  name them. And we have Shenghen space=free Borders between countries.
yes Angel Roy Was it 6 ft tall..
yes The question is, would a wall have stopped this guy from coming here? No, because the vast majority come across ports of entry, not the desert.
no Please DONT sign the Border Wall bill.   TOO much Fat in 1100 pages.
yes Fear mongering douchebag
no Thank you, President Trump!! If there has ever been a time to declare an emergency, it's now!! Invasion of our country IS a dire emergency! Unlike weather emergencies, the problem with invasions from our southern border will not "blow over", but will only get worse. Thank you for your work and determination to prevent our beautiful country from being turned into another Mexico. Behind you 100%! May God bless you and all your endeavors!
yes ttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/12/francillon-pierre-cold-case-mom-amy-fleming-arrested-after-30-years/2849712002
no To lose a loved one at the hands of someone who is not even supposed to be here is a slap in the face of justice. Build the wall!
yes He drove they let him across. The border patrol is part of the problem wall wont work Military
no Joyce Ames He has a good point..Where are Trumps words for the 5 Americans gunned down yesterday...49 days in 2019 and 39 mass shootings!Not one of them done by an illegal..
yes I understand if you react badly to this post because it's against your political views but you 400 or so people who laughed are disgusting. He lost his DAUGHTER. this is NOT a funny post whatsoever.
no They probably gonna call border patrol on you
yes Kim Thompson I do not listen to anyone but MY President Donald J. Trump I do not listen to LIARS or democrats.  Call it what you want>WALL,FENCING, BARRIERS but it is going up!                                                     Wall or Fence?  According to Vocabulary.com, The difference between a fence and a wall is that you can almost always see through a fence, at least to some degree, while a wall is solid.  If thats the case, then what is going up is fence. But, to be fair, many politicians, media figures and even border experts often use the terms wall and fence interchangeably.  And so has Trump                                                                        at times.https://www.factcheck.org/2018/04/has-the-border-wall-begun/
yes We need a class action law suit against every liberal that wont protect us & get the wall built & secure our borders !!! How many attorneys are willing to help us do this ????
yes Dallas Woody that was one of the worse decision EU made!
no Democrats are so full of hate for president trump they dont care about anyone being killed.  They only care about gaining control.
yes What a novelty this President Trump is.  He puts Americans and America first and tries to help everyone else after that. We need more politicians like him.
yes What about the white man that killed his family? Or the black man killed but the police. Or the kids shot up in the school by a natural born American? Just curious. I sympathize with ANY one who has lost a loved one due to senseless acts of an individual but how hypocritical of you to make the focus on one race. Hell what about the families of the slave? You can post a articles like this all day on all races. SAD!
yes Serious question: Did the (previous administration's) Operation Fast and Furious SCANDAL guns "WALK" over the open border? Or go through the Ports of Entry?  Untrackable Guns that got into the wrong hands.
yes Sheikh F Shahel hi
yes Why don't people just build walls around there houses and pay for it themselves. That makes more since to me. You should even get a tax break if you build a wall around your house.
yes Wait til one of them crazy gun toting bastards shoot your ass
yes Amen death penalty for those who kill our citizens
yes So what are you going to do about to do about your own murdering citizens Mr Trump, throw them over the wall
no And this is why crazy people need to be monitored more closely
no Who you calling stupid I flunked math but my intelligence is above average!   99 percent of people surveyed say they are above average.     And the other half is even higher, if you asked them about their children.
yes Build the wall and stop this crap before we the silent majority have to.
no Trump is one president and leader that truly loves our country! God Bless you every day in your work to keep us safe ! The Lord hears our prayers and you have  a lot of people praying for you.
no America is a continent dumbass are you talking about . the United States ...
yes Hey Dave, I believe that might be the stupidest response I have ever seen on immigration. Thank you, now you may STFU...
yes Temicka Brown move?
no So many against the border wall until if affects them. Wake up before it affects you and your family. Illegal immigrants are all over the country, not just in Texas and Arizona. They travel, too. All of the muslims getting elected are plabnin ghb to take over our government. That will affect your way of life and all generations to come. Vote against this
yes It's about time to put the fucking baboons in check! Sick of all the squabbling! We need a wall asap and those who disagree can leave this country! Why do people have locks on doors? To keep the ones that don't belong out.
no you bunch of brain washed cock heads will be the death of all of the human race , so gullibull. being lead by the ring in your nose to the chopping block , how the hell are there so many of you ?
yes Robert Dahlquist very good point. And very true! That's why as Servers, we are trained and certified about these things since we can be held responsible.
yes "Hardship!"  you mean like Officer Rohnil Singh's family is facing, or the tens of thousands of families whose loved ones will never be whole again?!  Like our 36 year old daughter who died last June because of illegals?!  Is that the kind of hardship you mean?!  At least those Americans in hardship have been made whole, and I did not hear of the shutdown killing one person!  #FinishTheWallNOW! #DeportThemAll!
yes He should be able to have an eye for an eye
no Abdul Majid she's legal...
yes We will be no safer and billions of dollars poorer.  Its a farce
yes https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/us/gun-deaths.htmlNearly 40,000 People Died From Guns in U.S. Last Year, Highest in 50 Yearsnytimes.com
yes Danny Jones where is the EU
yes Ask OBama!
yes So many sad stories caused by unsecured borders for many years and many presidents. Trump is going to fix it.
yes Please get the wall built!!!!!
yes Geoffrey Hostens so you wouldn't feel the same if she was ugly? Shame on you!
yes Let's not lose anymore of our children due to something we can work on to make safer
yes Steven Hunter Do you not understand that anyone who commits a crime and has to be locked up is separated from their children? That includes American citizens. That is the fault of the person who chose to commit the crime, like entering our country illegally.
no Aren't we all illegal immigrants?
yes Use the Drug Cartels money to build  the Wall!Amen +++
no SUCH BULLSHIT. Nothing to do with a damn wall.
no Teresa Pagniano  sorry for your loss but it was your brothers fault.!!
yes All this fear-mongering about illegals ... what about all the US Citizens pulling the same crap?
yes How hypocritical of Democrats who want to take guns from people because some are used to commit violent crime, but at the same time advocate free passage across our borders by many who have used them.
no #buildthewall #deportthemAll. #trump2020
yes Hop Sing Get them out
no Sam Twal just stay in your own little world that the rest of us call California
yes Theres a system and should be to get in any country our safety/ health should be upmost at the top of the list go do it trump
yes Thank you Best President in my time.  MAGA
yes 5 private citizens were killed at work in Aurora, Illinois on Friday. 5 police officers were injured while subduing the gunman, who was also killed.  The gunman was an employee who was being terminated.  His Illinois gun permit was pulled because he had a conviction in Mississippi, and the gun he purchased under that permit should have been confiscated.  This is a national emergency.  Five families in one day, lost a son, husband, father, brother, etc., killed by an American citizen who should not have had a gun.  39,000 people were killed by guns in our country last year.  That is a national emergency.
yes Democrats only care about illegals.
no The democrat communists lie everytime they open their mouths
no Kris Landers thats just stupid a person thats not supposed to be in this country it is called a illegal alien that person should not be here to be able to drink to kill a person seems to me youre not very smart actually the store owners fault also if she did not have a legal ID the store owner should be prosecuted and lose their liquor license to and get a fine but come onHopefully you dont have that many rocks rolling around in your head
no Tommy Carpenter How was he voted in illegally?  He won the Popular vote and Electoral College vote each time ...Trump lost the Popular vote...even with Putin's help
yes Agreed.  Democrats want to rebel but how much money Oblamma give Iran?
yes All the Dems I know want it built!!!!
yes We got your back 100 percent
no Build that wall!!!
no Americans kill Americans every day ~ are you going to build a wall to keep them away from law abiding citizens as well?  Not all illegals are bad but those are the only ones the news will tell you about ~ There are many who are honest people and want better
no Barnaby Rockefeller
no CliffandKim Ferrell   Republicans think we hate Trump more than we love America.  The truth is, we hate Trump because we love America.
yes Higher than our national average.
yes Mr. President we have been going to build a wall since Clinton! I support you being a real American President and getting it done!!!!!! The hoards are forming and are on their way!!!
yes Peter Richards 3/4 of a woman isn't 1 ? Do the math...here I'll help , 31 out of 100 , reduce it down 3.1 out of 10...reduced further .8 out of three , since there's no such thing as .8 of a person it would be 1...therefore the Sunday comics you use as mainstream media holds no relevance...have a nice day...to simplify...doing the math , it is 1 out of 3
yes If they truly don't work, as Liberals suggest then why are they so against them?
yes I hope the wall prevent missiles to come in too. Trump with all his BS is making the US look stupid and weak. He needs to really focus on how to make the country more powerful, not spending all of our money on dumb stuff.  Some of our allies are turning on us. Lately key allies like Turkey and India. He is just flexing and hoping to intimidate, that does not work anymore. He needs to act smarter.
no Yes. And I can hardly wait for the next Democrat President to decide that the need for universal healthcare and sensible gun control and global warming are all national emergencies
yes We need more posts like this.  News only reports about not wanting the wall. Never about the American people wanting it. That's why trump was voted in.  I am sure if it was one of those loud mouth reporters on television that lost a loved one they would be singing a different tune.   Or the Democrats in office.  I was a Democrat,switched over to Republican when trump was  running.
yes We need  your  voice  to  make  sure  she did not  die in vain.  Praying  God  will  help  you  through.
yes This poor family-in my thoughts & prayers!!
yes Its time to abolish the Democratic Party
yes If you're anti wall, then you're pro-slavery. If the wall stops the sale of one human being then it's worth every  penny. #StopSlaveryNow #BuildTheWall
no Scott Pennington you clearly dont understand much about the EU.
no Ron O'Hearn no I am anti Trumps form of nationalism and the product that is starting to be produced here in America.
yes We have to do something, walls do work and will force them to come through the port of entry.
yes So sad. Up with the wall
yes I love this cause its neglecting the fact that American people kill each other too. he's trying to control the population by using immigrants as a sort of scapegoats, kind of like a certain German I know
yes https://www.facebook.com/jddmcl/posts/525820511244061John DearolfThis was a jarring week as Trump declared a national emergency after Congress refused to fund his wall  perhaps his most brazen authoritarian act yet. Trumps... More
no Build the wall out of their foreheads
yes It should resigning as your highest priority.  You are an old senile sad old man
no Just an excuse for the federal system to seize ranches from solid Texas families without compensation. Be careful trump you will turn Texas against you.
no Doug Holmes move to USA Troll.
no Prayers for you and your family
yes http://www.weathermodification.com/ Protect us from the tyrants controlling the weather.
yes Only 30% of illegals get her through the border. The rest get here by over staying visas. Ask Trump what his plan is to stop that from happening. You want to stop illegals, address the primary way they get here or become illegal and stay. If not, you arent bein very serious about the issue.
no Build that wall. Lets get it on.
no BUILD THE WALL!!! Best President ever!
yes It's a STUPID argument...  it doesn't matter if the WALL is the most perfect deterrent - it's worth trying as part of border security.  What's the big deal about the money for the wall? Trump will have saved that much and more with his trade deals.  #buildthewall
yes Jess Castrejn thats why he donated his salary to studying alcoholism. Action speak louder than words
yes Estefania Torres Restrepo The southern border might as well be considered a port of entry. Cause they sure as heck enter through it. We cant just have open desert between the two countries where people are free to roam back and forth.
no It wont ever matter.  They will all keep making excuses.
no We need to give credit where it is so .Our Presadent
yes Term limits on welfare recipients
no It's a tragedy.
yes Build two rows of concertina mount .50 every half mile post a no mans land. That will work ask North and South Korea.......!!!
no Kris Landers so if the illegal was kept out because the illegal doesnt belong here, the drunk driving case involving said illegal wouldnt have happened.
yes How can you not associate mass shootings in this country to easy access to firearms?
yes We are behind you!  Build that wall  !!!
no Gary Lynn McGhee it means nothing.
yes I support you, Mr. President. I pray for you every day.
yes A border wall won't bring back the dead folks who have been killed by home grown American citizens or by illegal immigrants (who may have come in through an airport).  It is despicable to exploit peoples' personal tragedies for political reasons.
yes When my son was at a camp for young people with disabilities, US workers never called me to tell me my son had a fever and was ill. When I came to pick him up, he had a 102 fever and was sitting in his own waste for hours.
yes Whatever u do in life, please think about safety first. I wish African Leaders can start acting like mr Trump. Mostly Nigeria
yes Thank you President Trump!! God Bless you and this country!!!
no Stopping drugs at our ports and better tracking expired visas works better. Get El Chapo (Great Idea Ted Cruz) to pay for the wall and put that money into port security and visa tracking. Most bang for the buck.
no Although, wall construction may be slow, I hope everyone understands we would not even be having this conversation if Donald Trump were not the president.  Jeb Bush, no wall, Hillary definitely no wall, so the president IS getting the wall built and fighting the democrat party and half the republican party every step of the way.  This is OUR country, it doesn't belong to illegal aliens.  We are not here to serve illegals with tax payer dollars and benefits.
yes Nancy agrees! https://www.facebook.com/395216814380642/posts/397943094108014?sfns=mo
no Correct
yes Sheikh F Shahel ?
no https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/crime/2015/03/08/ped-killed-newark/24605963/  A white male killed my friend. Im going to assume he is a citizen.
no Eva Graham three equal branches!! Trump thinks hes above the Constitution!
yes Chris Weiss just because they were registered Democrats doesnt make them Christians.
no Sorry for your loss build the wall
yes yes we want the wall
no A white American men hit and run my truck where is the wall?
yes that sad
yes Joyce Ames hates pesky facts
yes Mar Reese  I know thats sad ... I m all for keeping our country safe build the wall
no Jason Hicks so a wall makes no difference
yes The only wall we needa build is around trumps goofy havin assss
yes This chick is dumb as hell. They do have background checks. In fact you go on a 3 day waiting list. I can go down to the corner of my house in the ghetto and buy a gun off the streets with no background check and the gun won't even have a serial number on it also known as a throw away. So again remind me how gun control is gonna work???
yes Jeanie Railsback sorry about your husband but if he was an illegal he wouldnt have to have insurance and his health care would be free in California!
yes The truth is the TRUTH, no matter what the left says. They may believe their lies, we don't.
no Build the wall.    Screw Nancy Pelosi
no WWG1WGA  #KEEPAMERICAGREAT WELOVE YOU
no MISTER PRESIDENT! OVER HERE!
no Yes, build wall
yes Heavenly Creator, Loving Parent, Holy Spirit, Divine Providence, Almighty,  We Praise You. We Thank You for All You Have Done, for All You Are Doing, and for All You Are Going to Do.  Please,  Bless the USA and President Trump indeed. Increase our territory for You.  Keep Your Hand on US. Keep US from evil and keep evil away from US. Help US to do no harm. May Your Reign Come, May Your Will Be Done, On Earth as It Is in Heaven. For Yours Is the Reign, and the Power and the Glory, Forever and Ever. MAGA! KAGAlways!
yes Would it make a fucking difference if it was someone else?
no Betsy Hammond do you realize we could have all that, is the Democrats would stop wasting $150 billion a year in benefits and protection, for illegals. Not to mention the money they spend hiring lawyers to fight depression of illegals who are felons, sanctuary cities, etc.
yes Curtis Rice are you trying toget an award for the dumbest post of the day?
yes Me myself don't like my tax dollar going to support illegals jumping our boarders just for the free ride it has to stop
yes https://www.facebook.com/TheOther98/photos/a.115969958413991/3022739964403628/?type=3&theater
yes You have been conned!  Paying Osama bin laden and George Soros and George W Bush won't fix anything.  A tall tree and a short rope is all you need to stop them.
yes I am so sorry for your loss.  I support your call for the wall as well.
yes & why shouldnt we have a wall???  Lets hear some logical reasons......
no Build the wall!
no Durrrrr duh durrrrrr (drool) Trump!!
no OCCASIONAL cORTEX.................................SHE SAYS THAT SINCE SHE IS ETHICALLY CORRECT( POLITICALLY CORRECT) IT IS OK THAT SHE IS FACTUALLY INCORRECT, OR, IN THE COMMON JARGON, LIES. SOCIALISTS THINK ITS OK TO LIE TO PROMOTE THEIR PLATFORM........
no It's clear, they just don't want our President Donald J. Trump to succeed. He's not one of "them" and they can't stand it. The amount he's asking for is like $57 of a "normal" family budget in comparison to the national budget. If someone offered to put a fence around your house for $57 would YOU do it??
yes Go to school learn to spell you are a subhuman species.
no Exploiting a dead woman is not the way to promote the building of walls. Think about the tunnels as well.
yes So sad you had to go through this horrible pain
yes Brother do you like Nirvana?
yes YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP IS VERRY CRAZY...
no Robert Cee yeah I do. He actually does what he says!  Oh and where's your impeachment for Russian collusion?  LoL epic fucktardedness
yes Keith Webber Jr. While he takes the money from the military infrastructure budget which will cause our military families to suffer more than they do now in housing that is falling apart. Pendejo!
no So very sad. On a avg. 5 Americans are killed on a daily bases  in one way or another by a illegal. AND YET the Democrats still do not give a damn!
yes EASTENDERS CORNER MEGAN UMBRELLA RHIANNA BLIND WITCHY CAR BATTERY TOLD A DROPPING IT LEAD CAT EYES STARE ME OUT POTTATOE HEAD BEAR COPY CAT SULPHURIC ACID STRONG OFF ITT
no Go trump
no If you want the wall pitch in your money to pay for it. Kind of a socialist thing to demand we pay for a wall the majority dont want or need.
yes Shirley Wilson prove it!
yes Chet Bentley youre a scumbag
yes Peter Richards look at boarder patrol statistics. I believe the people on the front lines. They support our President.
no They have killed more with all the deadly drugs they bring in . Yes their not all bad but with the wall it will stop the madness . Trump is trying to make America safe again democrats are stopping it .  Its very simple it wasnt very long ago with Obama     the Democrats wanted a wall to stop the illegals but now they are resisting because if trumps succeeds in getting a wall up and making America safe the Democrats will be on a sinking ship with a giant hole in the middle of it. The old schoolers need to look and see the  Democrat party they once believed in is long gone .  But they are lied to telling them Trump will take away Social Security and Medicare.  Its a lie . Trump said you earned it . God Bless America and lets come together as one .
yes Eva Graham Freedom of Speech!
no We need tougher alcohol laws my 19 year old died of a bau of .53, not old enough to buy and not old enough to be served the parents of another boy served over 200 kids most 16 and other then made them all drive home and they got nothing. For killing my son. Tougher alcohol laws please President Trump.
yes Sam North  mental heath issues! Cant force crazy people to get help so what is it you think can be done?  That company had the obligation to protect its employees that is NOT the governments job!! We have security at my company with a locked fence only a badge can get you in and cameras right there if face dont match you dont get in and when someone is fired we are all notified!!! Companies need to step up
no I sooo agree with COMPLETE OUR WAII TO PROTECT OUR BORDERS !!
no 110 % behind you...2020 we will show the power of the people again !!!
yes Stephen Mattison Nazi's used propaganda like Democrat and Liberal hate news does does to condemn the Jews. Demonizing a whole group of people for the crimes voting for Trump  is never justifiable. are Democrats taking money from the drug cartels politicians all see motivated by money over the best interest for Americans ,their position has no logic,with More than 70,200 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2017, including illicit drugs and prescription opioidsa 2-fold increase in a decade. ... Drug overdose deaths rose from 16,849 in 1999 to 70,237 in 2017. The bars are overlaid by lines showing the number of deaths by gender from 1999 to 2017 (Source: CDC WONDER).
yes One man, one incident undocumented as the alleged DUI perp was.   How would a wall have helped?  This DUI perp came through the border like over 90% of these cases do.  Help us understand how a wall would have helped!  This article is NOT a plea for a wall but rather more border security.  Every Congress person agrees we need border security.  A wall?  Nah!
no Horrific stories and I cant believe most think there is no emergency.  There certainly IS.
yes prayers for your family
yes Angela K Christensen.   Anybody who raises their hand would be foolish. We all know they came in by plane. A better question is raise your hand if you think the current wall is the reason all the Fentanyl was confiscated 2 weeks ago. Enough to kill 57000 people. That is the better question. Obviously those drugs wouldn't be coming into a port of entry if there was no wall. They would have come over in backpacks at points of the border where there isn't enough security.
no Paid writer
yes It is so sad that a leader would use the personal tragedies of a relatively small number of Americans to stoke fear in lots of Americans.  Perfection, in anything, cannot be obtained and sustained. We humans simply are not capable of perfection.  During Trumps Presidency to date, far more kids have been killed 8n their schools that Americans who have been killed by folk in our country illegally.  Seems like a greater emergency to me.....
yes Children killed in Sandy Hook, by a homegrown terrorist.   https://www.kveller.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-14-at-2.26.44-PM-1200x734.pngwww.kveller.comkveller.com

yes Build The American Wall  !!!!
yes What about the thousands of parents their children were killed by AMERICANS with guns?  Veterans. Medical care. Sorry about your daughter. But come on guys. We have WAY more impactful priorities!  Vanity wall. #TemperTantrum
yes Six prior arrests. Not required to submit for fingerprints to own a gun. Only when he applied for a concealed weapon permit was his prior arrests made known. Concealed carry permit denied. Gun was never turned into authorities. One of the five people killed was a university student interning in Human Resources. Over 1200 kids killed by guns since Parkland and none of these gun murders constitutes a national emergency.
no No TAXIZZZ
yes Tell the truth Donald Trump...ONLY THE WHITE ONES....ONLY THE WHITE ONES!
yes Samuel Tan Yuan Han and white men stole this land from the brown people.  So whats your point.  You think your better than them?  You arent
yes So when we building a border wall on Canada
yes Trump is playing ya'll for fools. Every politician does it.  They say "look over there!  They are your enemy!"  Meanwhile committing crimes around the planet with their oligarch partners.
no BUILD THAT WALL!!!!!!
yes LOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP! Trump is doing something worthy of impeachment. LOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP! 1
yes If walls didnt work then why do people keep building them?  Why do people build fences if they dont work? Do you live in a home? with 4 walls? I dont want my kids growing up in a world where they have to build walls around their hearts all because we couldnt build a wall on OUR border.
no Bill Clinton Declared 17 Emergencies, have fun with those court cases.....
yes Art Jackson hmmm, I lived down there and let me tell ya Art, not too long ago in El Paso, the drug dealers put razor blades on park swings and so forth. YOU call that safe? I do not. Try driving down there on the free way or the streets on the east side, some don't know how to drive with lines. My daughter had a friend down there whose father was found in the Rio Grande and the drones had to go find him. Hmmm safe, yeah right.
no Lisa Fuller yes
yes Im sorry for all the loses. GOD BLESS the ANGEL families. In my prayers.
yes Drunk driving is already illegal. Police are given tools to stop it
no Dave Callender Youre an idiot. Of course Americans kill others in accidents. The point is that if these uneducated, illegals never came here those deaths they caused never wouldve happened. If the wall saves just one life its worth it.
no Wall work that's true,  America first Donald Trump MAGA 2020!!!!
no There is no reason to believe a wall would have prevented this. It will not solve all your problems. It will disappoint you and give you a false sense of security.
yes That's true!!!!!
yes If that wall saves 1 ONE, American life from being a victim of these illegal border jumpers it is worth every dime!
no what about all the kids and adults who die by homegrown, born in the usa, murderers?
no Thank you President Trump!
yes An illegal alien (Honduran) kicked-in the door to my house and tried to murder my then-16 yr old son.  https://youtu.be/6h2qwAAge4c  A few years prior to that, an intoxicated illegal alien crashed into me, totaling my vehicle and damaging my left hand (which has never healed correctly).  Build the wall!
yes Chuck Brantley cant debate with stupid
yes Build the wall Tell Nancy to suck a bag of onions
yes An illegal immigrant killed one of my friends, I dont blame them all for it. Thats stupid. The choice of an individual doesnt reflect all of them
yes https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/opinion/trump-offers-socialism-for-the-rich-capitalism-for-everyone-else/ar-BBTr9Ux
no Michael Thompson been to places with walls too  Seen mfers climbing over them
yes Haters wouldnt be hating if there Son or daughter was killed by a illegal immigrant! Securing our borders is a priority! Walls, barriers, wire whatever! We have a crisis on our hands! I almost bet if it was a different President declaring this all you haters would be for it! Pretty dang sad let Our President Trump do his job!
no Then why do we have the h2a programs in place???
yes You take such hate for USa .  I Love You & Pray for you & yours.  You know GODS got yall
yes Men in this country on student visas from SAUDI ARABIA flew planes into the World Trade Center  Whats trumps answer to that?  Kneel at the Saudi princes feet....  Now  please tell me who the enemy of the state is?
no Build the wall. # TRUMP 2020
yes Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin 5) American Business  ~Investment is flooding back into the United States due to the tax cuts.  ~Over $450 billion dollars has already poured back into the U.S., including more than $300 billion in the first quarter of 2018.  ~Retail sales have surged. Commerce Department figures from August show that retail sales increased 0.5 percent in July 2018, an increase of 6.4 percent from July 2017.  ~ISMs index of manufacturing scored its highest reading in 14 years.  ~Worker productivity is the highest it has been in more than three years. Steel and aluminum producers are re-opening.  ~Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and NASDAQ have all notched record highs.  ~Dow hit record highs 70 times in 2017 alone, the most ever recorded in one year.
no Name calling????  Big joke.  Dems are the champion name callers.
yes So sorry for your lose. Can I just say though. Britain is surrounded by water. The wall will only work if your government isnt self serving and encouraging very high migration or immigration to keep wages down and their bunces up. This is the problem with the Western world. The polital elite are in it for themselves.
yes I am so sorry for your loss RIP.  We will ner forget.
no trump is USING them to further his agenda he couldnt give a crap about them
yes Traggic indeed, but what about when US citizens/residents massacre people using guns? 
yes Ginny Johnson
yes It is a national crisis and anyone thinking otherwise should go live at the border for a month!!
yes Food for thought, if the person who wrote this post doesnt reply, its a bot
yes Sharon Fantana why don't you ask Israel who had a ton of enemies?
yes Dude things change get over it
yes donald u the man
yes So sorry.
no 2018---Of the 154 MASS Shootings in USA not one was perpetrated by black, undocumented immigrants or females!!!!! But the truth is never liked, is it? All were committed by HOME GROWN WHITE MEN!!!
yes Nazi's used propaganda like Trump does to condemn the Jews. Demonizing a whole group of people for the crimes of the very few is never justifiable.
no If every American donated a dollar for a brick we could raise the money..build our wall....
no And you still get people who laugh at this. . What fucknuts.
no My heart aches for those that have unnecessarily lost a loved one bc someone was here illegally. I cannot even imagine the pain they are enduring over and over again every time they hear comments like, the wall is immoral.  There are more stories out there that I am sure havent been heard. For example, my son got in an accident with an illegal who pulled out of his driveway and smashed in the side of my sons car. Praise God my son wasnt injured, but I couldnt say that much about his car. The police told him there was nothing he could do bc the guy had no insurance, no drivers license, and was here illegally. My son had to shoulder all the expenses. Never should have happened. These incidents and more are why this problem needs to be cracked down on. Praying that President Trump resolves this problem and once again makes America safe again.
yes Nazi's used propaganda like Trump does to condemn the Jews.
yes why are you so stupid
no Walls work so keep that Freeland out! Make them tariffs on Canadian steel non negotiable! Canada must pay a price!
yes The democrat communists offer them all kinds of freebies and when they come here they find out it was a lie ? How would you react? So its all the democrat communists plan to destroy America and become kings and make us slaves
yes Jeanie, you should've "kept your doctor".
yes These socialist love chaos. If we dont put down Socialism we will be in trouble real soon
no God Bless you and your family.
no When our country is attacked by China or Russia because his puerile tactics make our once strong country look like a laughing stock to all the world, I want you to tell me again the he is a great president.   He is making our country the fool of the world by running it like the moronic clown he is.   You're as delusional as he is.  If you're not terrified then you're as much of a fool as he is.
yes Trump lacks certain qualities which are appreciated by good and decent people. He has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace.  He is a bully.  That is, except when he is among bullies like Putin; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling boot licker instead. The rules of basic decency cannot be found in Trump. He punches downwards  which a gentleman should, would, could never do  and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless  and he kicks them when they are down. The fact that a third of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think Yeah, he seems like my kind of guy is a matter of confusion and distress to people worldwide. There have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid. As reported in Japanese newspapers, Trump specifically asked Japanese PM Abe to nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize.    Twice before he submitted forged nominations on his own behalf because he is so desperately jealous of Obama.    How embarassingly sad is that?   Trump will never ever get a Nobel Peace Prize because he creates chaos and strife every single day....the opposite of peace.
yes Mathieu Gouman BUILD THE WALL
no Ohh I am so sorry I am just  broken and angry to keep hearing about these stories of families that are horribly hurt and affected by the awful illegals coming into OUR country.... BUILD THE WALL ... keep them OUT
yes We need more from many those have met the illegals.  Wake up everyone. Illegals and Muslims are the worse and we need protection from them.
no Great wall of China work. Jerusalem wall work. US must have wall. Overdue
no Soo beautiful.. Now a true angel. My deepest condolences.
no Abolish the Democrat party and let's call  them for what they are Communist socialist party.
yes Angel Roy walls are built to keep people/animals inside.
no The constitution clearly states that congress controls the purse strings.   This has not been a priority for either parties since the inauguration in 2017.    Congress does not give the executive branch money.     https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-constitution-and-the-federal-budget-process/
no Are we just gonna over look the massive foreheads
no Larry Lubiner so, you didn't pay attention about the thousands of migrants coming up from south America? What you are claiming is ridiculous!
yes Hah, hah, hah...  How funny you are, right?
yes John N Karen Morris not all of us are snitches John
yes Keep building the wall and deploying razor wire.
yes Also enforce the law in regards to USCIS form I 9
yes All the school shootings been done by Americans all the church shootings been done by americans.
yes Prayers for England
no Liar
no You are full of lies and bullshit
no Danny Jones absolutely
no  If we don't have the funds to build the wall along our own southern border  Then stop sending American tax-payer funded financial aid to foreign countries, stop financial aid to illegal aliens, stop importing cheap labor, stop allowing and enabling US jobs and industries to be outsourced to foreign countries and do not import foreign fuel, steel nor electronics used in our military weapons, national defense systems and power grids  Build the wall and guard the border using our drone and satellite surveillance systems to find and turn back unauthorized intruders  Also, hire our veterans and former law enforcement officers to monitor and minimize visa over stays.  This is The United States of America, it's our country and being a US Citizen is absolutely relevant  What the American People clearly want and need are more elected officials that will actually start putting the best interests of our own US CITIZENS first and foremost, and that includes appointing judges and others that will do the same.  For the first time in 30 years, we finally have a president that's actually doing something about our traitorous trade and immigration policies  And the corrupt manipulative media, establishment puppet politicians and their globalist masters are blatantly fighting President Trump and the American People tooth and nail every step of the way.
yes Pierre-Luc Vachon how's that gun control working out in Chicago?  Crime is UP since they started it there.
no But for the 1200 children killed in the US by guns since the Parkland massacre a year ago, sadly no emergency or protection there...
yes awful nice fear mongering you got there
no Melissa Lamphere you're triggered and brainwashed the wall is being built and it's beutiful. MAGA
no Eddie Gonzalez no one wants illegals hear besides idiots
no Waiting for congress to fund the act passed years before by the democrats to secure the border. Do you think he wants to take this to Supreme Court?
yes So sad but yes please do the wall!!!
no I agree  build the wall and protect America . So sorry and deeply saddened for your loss sir.
yes praying for you angel Dad...
no They crashed into my son's truck twice. No drivers license or insurance
no AMAAAAAAZING how many Right Wingers have become socialists by wanting US to pay for the wall.
no Thank you, Mr. President, for all that you do for Americans. You are a true patriot.  Happy President's Day! God Bless
yes Spencer Hilbrink  ooh
yes I don't think so.have had a child killed,
no I bet you if you look hard enough, you could find a murderer, who was in the military years ago and save the life of another Soldier!
yes First President that had to fight for Border Security as if it was a political issue rather than a National Security issue.  Something has gone wrong in American politics when one party weaponizes an American issue and uses it as a bartering tool thinking they will impress others and get their votes....they would be wrong on so many levels.
yes Curtis Rice lol - these comments are great. No one can even pull a BreitBart article above crime based on demographic.
yes Erin Salgado seriously? Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher.
yes I mourn your loss. However, declaring a national crisis and putting up a concrete wall will never solve America's immigration issues. Ronald Reagan once said  "Mr. Gorbachev, Tear Down This Wall. Bottom line, this is pure politics. It's all about satisfying his extreme right wing tea party base. Let the experts decide how best to solve our border issues. America is a democracy, not a dictatorship. The president continues to make up things and lie to the American people.
yes So when are we building the walls around our schools? And movie theaters? And workplaces? And concert venues (need a roof for that one, too)? And when are we putting all of the white males who have killed SO many more than immigrants in this country in kennels? I'm not belittling the loss of even one child, it's tragic and heartbreaking, but declaring a "state of emergency" over a few bad people who also happen to be immigrants does not make sense when we have mass killings on THIS side of the border.  A wall wouldn't stop most of they illegal immigration, we know that most come through other routes, and therefore it's false logic to assume it would have saved any of the lives he is exploiting. Do take the money allotted to beef up where they DO come through, and spend money fighting mass shootings of Americans BY Americans.
yes Patti Piccione Zambuto they can be verified
no BUILD THE WALL! HAPPY PRESIDENTS DAY MR TRUMP. GOD BLESS YOU & THE USA!
no I Thank you for all you have done for us
yes But you are opposed to gun control.....
yes Amen thanks Trump for protecting us getting bad drugs out

no How is building a wall to protect our citizens a violation to our constitution???
yes Bob Vasel if gun reform saves one life are you for it?
yes Mr. President donate your paycheck for our beatiful lovely wall that you promise so i could sleep peacefully and secured...by the way let me teach your wife how to make mexican chorizo she will love it thank you GOD BLESS AMERICA
yes Daryl SR Johnson  make that two of us and I can put a crew together when your ready
yes Dor Cohen sickening
no Nice
no wait till one of them have a wreck into nancy or chucks family
no James Chapman Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin fake crisis is your opinion you got from media opinion. Truth is the voters, the president & Federal border agents disagree. What one would you choose, media bias or the source of people who are on the boarder, the president who has access to info no one else does, the voters who put someone in office to do a job that has gone unchecked for years? Why are the Trump Zealots alway making False Claims and False Accusations??? Sorry unlike the Trump Cult I think for myself though my observations are often later repeated on various media. I have know President hoax for decades and he has always been a very FAKE MAN and Pathological Liar that has no credibility. His whole life is built around lies. He is nothing more than a very successful snake oil and elixir salesman. I lived on the border when many more people were crossing the border at the busiest part of the border and there was no crisis or emergency.It is not true that moist people that live or work on the border want a Useless Wall that can be easily circumvented. What most people want including people that live and work there is smart border security. That is what we need. Trump has created a completely fictitious emergency so that he and his cult can get what they want which is completely wasting billions of dollars in taxpayers money. But you ain't gonna get it as We The People, and that is the great majority of American's, oppose the Wall. Trump and his Cult will not get their BOONDOGGLE WALL!!! Get over your obsession and move on!!!!
yes Interesting you talk about research because you havent posted a link to any article. Can you post a link to the article you received these statistics?  Here is an LA Times article posted Last week saying that there isnt a crisis at the border.   https://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-trump-speech-immigration-border-crisis-20190206-story.html  Also Im not sure how the history of the country I was born in should have any say in who I am as a person? What if I judged you on the history of America? Last I checked, white people today should have no burden placed on them for the atrocities of slavery in America. Let me know since thats what Ive been reading.
no Build the wall please
yes So sorry for your loss!
no http://ourfilm.org/
yes So what are you doing about the most recent mass shooting?
yes Daniel Alexander Allen How Many illegals should we deliver to your door. I am tired of them. It pulling theyre weight here in America.. Let them get in line and come in the legal way. https://www.watchdog.org/national/reports-illegal-immigrants-receiving-medicaid-costs-taxpayers-billion-annually/article_6a9860a6-d0bd-11e8-92ed-5bca8b2d3b38.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=user-share
no hummm maybe you might need to learn to be a better driver with all those wrecks.  just saying seems like it is always someone elses fault 2 sides to a story
no Meren Tinu  let them i do believe President Trump is pulling out of there! Let China or Russia pay for them now I mean their own people are starving but hey I think its time America worried about America
no Wake up America  ! Wake up Christian church  ! Impeach remove your Satanism from office  The Democratic party has become the nazi party hualacost murdering babies  ! Remember Beghanzi fraudulent claims  Remember the selling of uranium to Iran  Remember 150billion under table to Iran  Remember KAVANAUGH hearings  SAVE America Save the family
no Thank you President Trump, please continue to gather the funds to build our country's beautiful border wall..
yes How many people have been killed by a citizen?  Dumb argument
yes CRIMINALS COME IN ALL COLORS.....just saying.
yes Devin Diamond  Im so sorry for your loss:(
no As it turns out, back in 2011 then-President Barack Obama issued an executive order blocking property of transnational criminal organizations. Obama cited his authority as granted through the Constitution to invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701, and the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1601. The latter is the same legislation that Trump is citing to get funding for the wall to achieve his immigration reform goals. That executive order targeted a number of criminal organizations, including the Mexican Los Zetas cartel, an ally of the MS-13 gang President Trump has regularly called out as a danger to Americans.
yes Asking the Lord to guide you, give you His wisdom and protection during this time. You have my support
yes So very, very sorry.
no Now the Dems r in-sighting Protest against the presidents national emergency which will turn into riots which will turn into blaming it on the Republican president for inciting bad behavior even though the Democrats are the ones that calling for the protest
no A wall won't completely STOP the illegals from coming in but it will deter them and slow them down cause nothing is going to STOP them from coming in completely
yes Will Murray
yes Gun control will protect to the county. I dont wanna see another school shooting....
no President trump 2020 !!!!!!
yes So terrible!!!
no Michael Najm They will if they make the deal!
yes #BuildTheWall #MAGA
yes I live in Brownsville, TX., front lines. We had a steel slat high fence built here in our area seems like 7-8 years ago now. Only problem I see thats not being addressed, is that along the border here where the Rio Grande River the apparently we have EPA regulations blocking anything being built within a certain distance from the river... So in many cases the fence is several miles inland on the U.S. side, dividing private land and surface streets. There are gaps in the fence in these areas so people can drive through and access that part of Brownsville. Seems like it would do more good if we fixed the EPA regulation and built a gap-less fence on the border instead of hindering access to privately owned land. I used to drive patients to their appointments and frequently pass through the fence unchecked in a 13 passenger van.
yes I want to protect Mexico from the guns flowing in to the cartels hands from the US.   Protect little Foreign boys and girls from being smuggled north and raped by rich pedophile Hollywood Elites and  other Democrats.  Stop powerful drugs that are being introduced to all races of Americans and wreaking havoc on their lives, their health, and their loved ones.  Stop the unnecessary deaths caused by the lure of an open border, and by the criminals that repeatedly enter illegally and do harm to our citizens and legal residents..  Democrats never opposed a wall as part of border security until they decided that if Patriotic, Constitution loving, law abiding citizens will not support their extremely authoritarian and oppressive agenda, they would create Sanctuaries for illegal aliens to colonize America with people who know how to live under oppression and accept authoritarian rule.
yes Justin. they are too stupid to be reasoned with
yes Daniel Jenkins everything!

yes #BUILDTHEWALL secure our borders President #TRUMP do whatever you have to do to get it done asap.
no And how many US citizens have been killed by other legal US citizens in mass shootings? Oh, but somehow that's more acceptable to you?
yes Thanks Mr President
yes Pure Propaganda.
no #bestpresidentever
no How Democrats and Republicancrats are against the wall boggles my mind. Many Republicans give lip service, but when push comes to shove, they aren't much different than the Democrats. Keep exposing the RHINOS.
no Patty Bertocchini La Puma that only stands to reason because US citizens outnumber ILLEGALS like 20 -1 but let's not ignore the fact that they dont belong here and are a drain on taxpayers, government resources,  and our economy.  The fact that they kill and rape people is only 1of the many reasons to keep them out do you have a fence around your house? Doors with locks on your house ? Same thing
no Walls do work. Why else do we build them? Just the other day I built a barricade to keep my dog in the living room. Guess what, It worked. :D
yes Eddie Barrett 49 days into 2019 and 39 mass shootings already.
yes Although it seems crazy but without a wall people can cross from 390 to 260 people to reach the United States as we have seen in the news, with a wall that will cost them to cross that amount. The president is right
yes No wall will be built. You know it
yes Edgar D. Gutierrez the first lady was here LEGALLY and then became A LEGAL CITIZEN. What part dont you understand so that I can dumb it down to your level.
no James McFarlane You can certainly have him. Any respect I might have had for him vanished the day he referred to Hispanics as murders and rapists. As if we in the US have only law abiding citizens.
yes I'm illegall.....
no Carly Nacarato  Youre full of it, but youre a little snot nose Millennial.
yes And AMERICAN born CITIZENS are killing my fellow AMERICAN FRIENDS !!!
yes Hi from Sweden
yes Gree Gree Yes. If murders got what they deserved maybe they'd be less of them.
yes All in all just another prick and his wall
yes #why do those who die without lslam enter fire? #Because he did not worship God who created him# #Is justice that God punished Jesus in order to forgive us our sins? #If Jesus is God how he struck,where is His Power? #You worship someone like you
yes People that don't get this are sick in their head.
yes Renee Korabiak ,there was? Too bad it failed!
no Lisa Mann it would, but Trumpcucks are very very stupid.
yes trump leads through fear. Just don't buy it!!
yes Steven Keslar why do you feel the need for name calling. I swear u should have been a liberal

no Bill Johnson One angel family does not a crisis make!!!!  Trump declares national emergency...  Nobodys done the job that weve done on the border,  said Donny as he declares a national emergency today........the slowest emergency in history.  And with the lawsuits that will ensue, his wall will not be funded or built until after the next election...if ever.  THE WORLDS SLOWEST EMERGENCY!!!!!  Donny lied directly to Americans about his border crisis.  Our Liar-in-Chief said that all the data that refutes his crisis designation is lies.  Got that?  Our president told the American people that THE FACTS ARE LIES...this is what all wannabe dictators say.  This egomaniac is THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!  Donny doesnt seem terribly concerned about this crisis.  He plans to travel to Florida mere hours after declaring the emergency from the White House. A president, in times of strife, would typically stay in the nations capital to oversee the crisis. Donny plans to do so from the comfort of his weekend getaway.  In reality, Donny is preparing the country for a fake war as he plans to enjoy a mini vacation. The only national emergency in America right now is one of leadership!!
no I am so sorry. I agree with you 100%. God bless your family. Keep fighting. You will save someone's life.
no An Army friend of mine from TX once told me in 2001 that when he goes home he wears a border patrol hat just to stir things up and clears the street. When I asked him why he said that his parents came over here legally from Mexico and that it wasn't always easy growing up but they were always proud and that people that come here illegally a just make it harder for everyone else and have no honor. When he and his siblings grew up they went to work for border patrol and the one in the Army. He's who I got my immigration views from because I can respect that.
no Come on Republicans... Sure up party lines and defeat any and all attempts to block our declaration.
no Estefania Torres Restrepo A Wall will keep out hundreds of illegals. Then more attention can be given at legal ports of entry to stop drugs flowing into the country. More people could be after the over stayed visa people.
no Syed Taqi missed the point stupid!!
no Yes.  Build the WALL!
yes You are so stupid. Please get your head out if your ass and stop being a fear monger. Show the comparison of people killed by other Americans in all of the mass shootings. Walls don't fix that..  Stupid.
yes India full support
no Bitvrealky, the immigration allowing amnesty for anyone declaring a relationship within the US or anyone taking car if "unaccompanied " minors..really...why would you sign this debacle.. close it down first!
no This is what the demonrats call a manufactured crisis..
no Nora Arevalo it is rather difficult to hand dig a tunnel. Have you considered that?  Have you thought about how long it would take. Do you think or just spout Democratic talking points?
yes Art Jackson  Dear... The problem of immigrants before the elections before 2016... The problem is outdated... But at the beginning of 2017... Congress was Republican... The wall and its problems will not affect the 2020 elections... Like now... On the contrary it will be positive... and other things...
no Once a border wall of any real size is installed and paid for,  it is just about cost free.  Think of just how much the Border Patrol agents cost, drones, electronic surveillance, and the like.  They are a continuing expense, and maintenance cost.  BUILD THE DAMN WALL, NOW.
yes Gary Masters  Oh, go cry in your koolaid.
yes #FUCKTRUMP
no I hope he goes ahead and does it!
no Adam Somerville  Is a moron
yes Lynn Limauro Floyd A white guy drove drunk and killed my uncle. We need to deport white people too!
no What about the five people yesterday??? Let's declare emergency on gun control!!!!
no I support you  100 percent ,those opposed are being led like sheep unto slaughter!
yes If a wall would have saved your daughter and you have proof of that, I am with you. But most illegals come through ports or overstay their visas. Money spent on securing those areas would most certainly help and had a better chance of helping your daughter.
no I also believe President Trump will dedicate his second term to draining the swamp as promised, which in my opinion is brilliant
yes Keith has an ART degree.
no Down on the border where we live, IT IS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY.  BUILD THE WALL.
yes It's like a stop sign. How many die b4 installing the damn sign.
yes And make Trump properties use it..how many Illegals did Trump have at his facilities?
no Heres one cherry picked example to prove a stupid point. How many thousands of people die from cars every week? Lets outlaw them! How many people die from gun violence? Lets confiscate them all! Obesity? Forced dietary restrictions for the overweight!
no Behind you 100 % illegal. immigrants need to come in the right way . Democrats need to wake up on this issue. And the drugs that are comming in.
yes trump's uneducated, low-IQ base is triggered by stories like this that ignore the facts. Illegal immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than native-born Americans, and a wall would do nothing to stop the flow of illegal drugs. There is no "crisis" at the border. Illegal crossings are at historic lows.
yes Shirley Wilson and I must tell you our VA does suck....being ran by folks with no experience and don't care.Son just retired from AF,was in the whole show last 25 yrs....he has a state job working in fraud division and our VA is in shambles.The wall should take a backseat to our problems at this time....drugs are gonna get here,workers will be hired by the wealthy,and things will continue till our mind set of helping others instead of putting up walls physically or metaphorically change.Its all realative.I hope you have found peace.
no My heart and prayers go out to all you Angel families. So glad the President honoured acknowledged you
no And i agree with you
no DEMOCRATS / TREASON
yes The President declared a  National Emergency then went Golfing?!? Trump is a Bad Joke - an Irresponsible Scumbag!!
no Jones Jebaraj there are shootouts in America by white conservative men . What will you do for that.. oh yes build more mental.institutions
yes Keith Nance well guess what. It isn't. Trump proposed a 19th century steel wall. We need to utilize a 21st century solution that will both cost less and be better at securing the border.
yes DUI ended you daughter's life,  not someone's citizenship.
yes I illegal murder to many ,keep Americans safe from ppl that aren't supposed to be here.
yes is not the wall , we need the money for the next election , people are die of cancer every day and you think illegal are the problem
no Tommy Carpenter  There is a question mark about her status when she was doing her original porno shots. She might not have had the right visa for that. Also when she got her final visa she did so with a so-called Einstein visa which is supposed to be reserved for people who are exceptional in their line of work.
yes Kelly Preiss Wilhelm white, black, asian, latino gang shootings,...you have no clue...take a look at percentages of race to murders.....why just blame white...all races do it....even women
no @Cancel President Day ... until we get a ligitimate one!
no Heaven has walls the great wall of China works well too.#factsudemdummycrats
yes Never happened. More trump lies.
no BUILD THE WALL.
no https://joinkgm.co/r/Morishey
yes Trump and his friends believe in voter suppression and billionaires buying elections. We want Automatic voter registration, the overturn of Citizens United and Election day as a national holiday. History is on our side. We will win this struggle
yes You retards are making this orange sack of cum think he's the best president ever . . Stop it !
no Richard Paff Agree
yes my condolences.  thanks for having the where with all to foster yourdaughters memory by putting forth your feelings on this subject for the good of america
no Yes build the wall sooner rather than later
yes Just makes me so angry that our government turns a blind eye to american's and kisses the ass of illegal's just for there illegal vote. How can they even say this is a made up. I would never wish this on anybody but they just might have to walk in the shoe's of a family that lost a loved one when it could have been Prevented!.
yes Democrats have no concern for the victims of ILLIGAL entry into this country and the outcomes such as this; even as saddening as it is. It's all about stopping ANY progress of this presidency - even though he's done more FOR this country and its people, citizens and the hopefuls - of ALL ethnic backgrounds ---- than ANY previous potus in the history of MOST current living generations today; if not EVER  !!! DEMS campaign on open borders, abolish ICE, catch and release, NO voter ID, sanctuary cities, raising taxes, aborting babies up to the day of birth - moments AFTER birth in Virginia, they NOW have TWO in Congress that were sworn in on the Quran instead of the HOLY BIBLE and since then - they've (DEMS) removed the phrase "so help me God" FROM the oath - to better accommodate or """NOT OFFEND""" their future colleagues.  And some people don't even understand the dangers, mindset and future intentions of "The RADICAL ISLAMIC DEMOCRATIC TERRORIST PARTY"... Wake up people.
yes Acataphasia Grey , the one about the drunk driver that hit and killed the teacher is not a joke. I Googled it. This man was illegal. His papers were not real. He was drunk, hit her, killed her and ran.
no Sources?
yes Carl Ostendarp at least he didn't have a big party and our boys in bengezi wasn't important enough for him or hillary to try and get them help! i call  BS BS BS at least the man does answer when called no matter where he is.
no A drunk driver that was previously DEPORTED, which then made it a felony to come back. Was re arrested, but STILL out drinking and driving.
yes It may lessen the human flow but there are other ways to manipulate the system
no The problem is Americans, not immigrants. This country was built on immigrants coming here to have better jobs and be able to be who they want to be.  Everyone who disagrees with that is disgraceful to our ancestors. They might as well spit on their graves.
no Mary Larkin and Ted Bundy killed a lot of white girls too.  What is your point.
yes There is no such things as "Gun Violence" or "manmade climate change", both are made up crisis! guns do 3 things, they fire, they fail and they rust, hate is in  the heart and you cannot legislate that! Finally it isn't a damned competition you witless troll, illegal border jumpers are not supposed to be her at all, FULL STOP!  By your logic because we have an epidemic of social violence brought on by liberal ideologies, we should let in more criminals?! You really are a special kind of stupid!
no Thank you Mr president for helping us Americans.
yes https://twitter.com/RespondTrump
yes Photoshop
no What is wrong with Country ? this is a no brainier - secure our country - keep safe our people
yes Why havent you pushed for the northern wall yet??
no When people post this do they ever think about the domestic terrorism that happens here all the time daily?
no Mike V. Radatti more Americans are killed by fellow Americans with guns than anything else including drugs from over the Mexican border and illegals put together
yes Really ! What planet did you float in from
yes Many thanks , and prayers go out to cover you with the full suit armor of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior .
yes If the Dems can't see how needed the wall is... then how can we ever trust them with anything (we as) Amaricans would ever need at all?
yes You're never gonna convince Democrats who are mentally ill.
no Danny Jones Ive always wondered why GB joined the EU, they were stable without them. Good luck to you
yes Kent Wojahn and lets it forget- these things that still need addressing- NEEDED addressing during Obamas tenure as well!
yes Tim Masters
no Greetings President Trump theirs 250 resurvations circumferencing the united states,
no Trump is right but everyone wants a different agenda which it's a bad one
no Ryan Lawes Cameron Oviatt yeah murica pew pew
yes Mr. President, your signing of this Omnibus Bill that is complete garbage is the first thing you've done while in Office that makes me wonder "what the hell were you thinking?".  You should have laughed in their faces when they put this crap in front of you. And all to prevent another shutdown? Maybe those folks shouldn't have taken a "non-essential position"!
yes Dont give up, Mr. President. Thank you for trying to protect our country.
yes An Indianapolis colt was killed by one
no Not happy for their loss. So devastating    Glad only they support trump
yes Build the great wall america
no #BUILDTHEWALL #NICEANDTALL
yes Everybody cares about his or her own self, but as a president his primary aim suppose to be putting the  needs of the masses first before considering his own need because without the masses who voted for him he will not be in that seat.
yes Keith Webber Jr.  ahh ha yet the Dems think they have a fight lol wow
no George Winn not dems fault Trump lies and makes up statistics that contradict government agencies to justify his wall.  What happened to Republicans being fiscally responsible?  Also not the Democrats fault Trump was planning this all along but decided to make over a million Americans suffer before declaring his emergency.
yes Im so sorry about the loss of your daughter!  I  totally support President Trump and the building of this wall.
no God bless America
yes Guns kill many more, why isn't that an emergency?
yes Deport all Americans you must be including yourself then
yes Yeah i can see how touched you are demonrat  you are so blind by the fake news media and by the demonrat party that you can't see how much things he has accomplished
yes Dear Mr. President Trump, At first, I was a bit skeptical about having a business man run for president when I believed you had little knowledge of politics. Then you began to open my eyes to the corruption that as been in the White House for far too long. Like all business men, your main concern is to protect the company which he has invested into (that being the people of the USA). If walls don't work, then why do we fence in our backyards? (To protect our children from the known dangers of the outside world.) Why do we fence in cattle when it seems inhumane to force an animal to a restricted area? (To protect the investment of their owners and others from harm). Why do we fence in our public schools? (To protect innocent children from savage people who wish unnecessary violence against the future of America). Why do we build retaining walls around our house? (To stop mother nature from destroying our shelter, our home). Why do we build walls around freeways and areas of high traffic? (To protect each other from the negligence of other drivers and to protect our people from hit and runs). Why do we build railings on our bridges? (To protect people from the dangers of failing far far below). Your interest is direct and logical. Let's protect the American people from the dangers of our Southern boarder before the danger/crime/violence happens (Still a little late because there are many of Americans who have lost love ones due to not having a wall). Democrats are doing everything in their power to stop you, don't let them! They are after the votes of the illegals, not the protection of their citizens! You sir will most likely be the greatest president in my lifetime. Opening America's eyes one day at a time. Wake up or fall victim to the violence and destruction the Democratic party wants. Keep fighting for the American people, it's been a honor to have you for a president sir!!! #TRUMP2020
yes so agree, get it built.
yes Wake Up America.
no The wall is just a distraction for Drumpfs dwindling base. Drumpfs 2016 campaign chairman Paul Manafort, attended a pre-sentencing hearing for his crimes this week. The recommendation was for him to serve between 19-24 years. His sentence was increased due to his continued lying about the contacts between the Russian government officials and his campaign team. Why would the 69 year old continue to lie and inevitably choose to die in prison? Keeping his boss out of it and hoping for a presidential pardon perhaps. I dont know but Special Counsel Robert Mueller does. 
yes Walls  work  IF  they  are  prison  walls  with  the  required  human  resources.  May  you  know  such  in  your  lifetime.
yes America first because it's the right thing to do.Best President ever.
no Babi Nikki That was the most ignorant comment yet. You need to learn some American history . My grandmother immigrated from Ireland the correct way. We as a nation have laws and they are to be upheld to protect our Country. All you have is what you regurgitate from the liberal socialist side. Educate yourself before you post comments.
no I think that's how the natives yielded too, when you invaded them.
no Dont forget the Sheriff that was killed in California by an illegal immigrant which the Governor completely ignores.
yes Babi Nikki So sorry for your loss and the added grief put  on you from our broken immigration laws.  I do hope that sharing your son's story will save someone else's life.  I also apologize  for Babi Nikki.  She can say such cruel things but not brave enough to use her real name.
no Tony Palmer  I but it would prevent massive drug influx and criminals from entering
no So sorry.Solution : wall+deportation
yes We have needed Walls for over 30 years, Thank you President Donald Trump
no Betty Bilbrey Yep.  The dems are pretending nothing is going on down here.  I just tell them to have another cup of covfefe and settle down.
yes And Americans dont drink and drive??   Its just the brown skin people who arent allowed to be criminals. White Americans, can be.
yes We know and agree The left is hateful and evil
yes Lisa Pursley when did they start the wall...
yes So another mass shooting happened yesterday and we have nothing to say about protecting innocent people from this?  Sad
no Close the bordes . Keep America safe .
yes And sadder yet, 4 people were shot and killed, 4 Police Officers wounded Aurora, IL in the weekly mass shooting. THAT IS AN EMERGENCY you Idiotic POtuS!
yes Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin 8.) Worker Development  ~ Established a National Council for the American Worker to develop a national strategy for training and retraining Americas workers for high-demand industries.  ~Employers have signed Trumps Pledge to Americas Workers, committing to train or retrain more than 4.2 million workers and students.  ~Signed the first Perkins CTE reauthorization since 2006, authorizing more than $1 billion for states each year to fund vocational and career education programs.  ~Executive order expanding apprenticeship opportunities for students and workers.
yes When an immigrant kill 1 person white citizens have already killed 10, I guess whites never wanna lose,  always on the lead on everything specially when it means killing innocents.  Facts from history
no A warrior??? I think NOT! He has bone spurs, remember.
no Mike Charles Im the only one posting facts and figures collected by research organizations.  Please feel free to post the information you guys have backing up your understanding of illegal immigration.  Also Im not sure how this has anything to do with Republicans or Democrats. This is about what is the most effective tool to deal with illegal immigration and understand the actual statistics put forth by those who study illegal immigration.
no Good please also drain the swamp on processes food and get it out of the markets before it kills more American Families go strong on FDA  and keep them legit as it seems they are approving poison
yes The whole wall not just a little piece of it the whole wall
no Tick-tick-tick
no Did Acosta go and talk to the angel family's after his episode and nonsense questions??
yes Why don't you stay focused, to damn stupid
no Same with all of us Americans who have lost family members to gun violence. Not one word ever said by Donny about that.
no Ur great Pres Trump ... watching from Vienna
yes How many schools shooting have there been
no Trump is a fear-mongoner.  Unite US - what a joke

no Kyle Callender ....Control laws TAKE lives......  The more guns in civilian hands equals less crime and safer communities.  Every year in the US guns are used millions of times to stop criminal actions.  By contrast a relatively few innocent people are killed with one.
no if someone breaks into your home, does that make them an illegal resident or a criminal? 
yes Looking forward to you in prison, traitor.
yes BUILD THE DAM WALL
yes May her memory be a blessing
no whoever denies that wall will work is an idiot with an agenda in collution with the drugs cartel of Mexico
no there it is, the dumbest thing you'll see all week
yes Ban alcohol. Ban cars. Ban guns. Ban breathing. All of those things result in death.   PS: If you served in the military and have the balls to message someone else about their opinions on Facebook, don't block them before they have the chance to reply. You were probably in the reserves anyway, not active duty. Fucking Call of Duty couch warrior.
no I can only see the notification and youre misinfor,  try again.  Im sure its nonsense.  But  before you do, look up who is doing the killings.  Im not misinformed
yes Gabriel Urea what is your point
no You are a heartless human.  I hope you never have to feel the pain of losing a loved one. He made a bad decision to drink and drive. He shouldn't have been  here in the first place and of story. They may never get justice for their daughter and that's so sad.
no David Thoreson and the president would NOT respond for OUR safety
yes The wall will fix drinking and driving?.........
no I agree we must build the wall, but how can we ignore this dude has a fucking 10 head. Lookin like jimmy neutron all grown up
no American citizens have killed 4 of my friends and 2 family members what we doing about that
no Go for it trump
no Everybody knows Trumps right! Just a bunch of babies raising hell for the sake of raising hell!
yes Kenny Shuster no America says so.  If you want to keep on supporting the illegals invite them to your house
yes Awesome idea. Whos going to take your place?
no We'll wait Curtis. Let us know how you fare. Just kidding. We don't care. Just GTFO.
no Its incomprehensible that Americans are actually fighting against keeping illegals out. What part of illegal do they not understand?
no And your point is? Every little bit helps.
yes Wall wont stop it from happening.
no You'd actually have to start it before you can finish it ;)
yes Release the babies stop family separation
no Im sorry for your loss
yes Hello Mr Wall Trump
no Safer
yes Dovid Staples They do want to ban mental problem people from having guns.
yes In my personal experience I have been assaulted by good old fashioned God-fearing Southern boys 3 times.  Your opinion does not invalidate my personal experience. Please tell me about your experiences as a lesbian.
no Another murder on the hands of the democrats
no Tracy Driskell that might get you 30 days!
yes Build that f*cking wall! We the people stand behind you Mr.President!
yes They need to make a trench along the wall on r side about 10ft deep and 10ft wide, fill with rattle snake and when they go over or under well; let just say the snakes will welcome them to the USA!!!! LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
yes Sorry and sad for your lost we definitely need to man up with the wsll
yes Joseph Nowik , ask Obama, he started it.
yes Walls work , thats why we all have one around our houses! Make complete sense!
no Yes sir for sure
yes Those that live in gated communities tell us walls dont work.  Those that have armed bodyguards tell us we should not own firearms.  Those that have worn blackface condemn us for asking them about it.
no Democrats are power hungry socialist traitors that don't care about dead American citizens.  They care about votes, and destroying core values of the country, like democracy and capitalism.
yes 5 people died yesterday out of a machine gun in illinois that's the emergency Mr President assault weapons,your border emergency is crap made up in your head
no 20% of illegal immigration comes in through Mexico, and a wall won't stop half of that.  Logical legislation is need, not a stupid wall.
yes Build that wall.   Cost doesnt matter  Life is Priceless
no Betsy Hammond How much would the money HUSSAIN  SENT TO IRAN BUY????
yes Its is his highest priority! Even one murder is over the line. Even for one the wall must go up!
yes BUILD IT NOW...I DON'T GIVE A DAMN WHERE THE MONEY HAS TO COME FROM...GET IT AND USE IT ON THE WALL!!! PEOPLE CAN COME IN THE "OLD FASHION" WAY...LEGALLY!!!
yes Sue Howie just like obama with his shutdown
yes So Veronica where exactly did this happen ?
no the arrigance of the left in idealizing illegal immigrants as good citizens who just want to fit in and find a better life for their family. i should note, however, that probably most people killed by drunk drivers were the victims of American citizens. I know of a couple of cases, and it is just as bad if the killer is an American. If the laws were enforced better or were stricter these tragedies could be reduced. We should not focus solely on illegal immigrants for crimes that are widely committed by non-illegals. That is no excuse for illegals, however, it is just how things are.
no I am so sorry for your loss.  I will be praying for you all.  Thank God for our President who will build the wall.
yes Why do you believe that being killed by an illegal immigrant is somehow worse than being killed by citizen - which happens with far more frequency? In Texas, where we keep statistics on these things, citizens commit violent crimes at higher rates than  illegal immigrants. Wed be better off deporting citizens. (Which ICE sometimes tries to do.)
no Bruh your like 400 years old. There was no wall when u were born.
yes Too bad it wasn't PELOSI'S or Schumer's kid...sad for these parents
yes Emily Neal lmfao you ever heard of Chicago? Look it up ! One if the safest cities in America with the strictest gun laws around!
yes It must be  a Federal Emergency. Trump is playing golf.
yes THANK YOU 4 caring enough to do something 4 the Citizens & Immigrants that came here LEGALLY.   Obama sent Billions 2  " other " countries 4 borders,  well now WE need protection 4 ours !     ILLEGAL still means ILLEGAL !!!
no Democrats are planning on suing because of the wall. Why can't those Americans who have been victims, lost their love ones by illegals place a lawsuit against them? If our boarders were secure, these innocent Americans would have never lost their lives!
yes Liberals are crazy nutty dumbass people
yes Clause 7 Clause 7. No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.
no A car accident killed my granddad. May as well ban cars. See how fucking stupid your logic is?
yes Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin 9) Health Care  ~Signed an executive order to help minimize the financial burden felt by American households Signed legislation to improve the National Suicide Hotline.  ~Signed the most comprehensive childhood cancer legislation ever into law, which will advance childhood cancer research and improve treatments.  ~Signed Right-to-Try legislation, expanding health care options for terminally ill patients.  ~Enacted changes to the Medicare 340B program, saving seniors an estimated $320 million on drugs in 2018 alone.  ~FDA set a new record for generic drug approvals in 2017, saving consumers nearly $9 billion.  ~Released a blueprint to drive down drug prices for American patients, leading multiple major drug companies to announce they will freeze or reverse price increases.  ~Expanded short-term, limited-duration health plans.  ~Let more employers to form Association Health Plans, enabling more small businesses to join together and affordably provide health insurance to their employees.  ~Cut Obamacares burdensome individual mandate penalty.  ~Signed legislation repealing Obamacares Independent Payment Advisory Board, also known as the death panels.  ~USDA invested more than $1 billion in rural health care in 2017, improving access to health care for 2.5 million people in rural communities across 41 states Proposed Title X rule to help ensure taxpayers do not fund the abortion industry in violation of the law.  ~Reinstated and expanded the Mexico City Policy to keep foreign aid from supporting the global abortion industry.  ~HHS formed a new division over protecting the rights of conscience and religious freedom.  ~Overturned Obama administrations midnight regulation prohibiting states from defunding certain abortion facilities.  ~Signed executive order to help ensure that religious organizations are not forced to choose between violating their religious beliefs by complying with Obamacares contraceptive mandate or shutting their doors.
no Joseph Roy ...Kris Landers missing the whole point. Plain and simple..this person should not be in this country. What part of illegal does she not understand? End of the day this young ladies life is gone as a result of an illegal immigrants action. Nothing petty about that.
yes MR President, I would be honored to serve as security for our country on the border.
yes Keep our children safe... build the wall!!!
no Come on America!  Not nearly enough shares of this post! Do not expect the MSM to spread the information, they have a different agenda. If you Love it, Share it!
no I am so very sorry for your loss!
no Build the wall. Move on. Use drug money held in escrow. These drug lords are in jail, on the run, or dead. If the ACLU doesnt like it, build a wall around them.
no Betsy Hammond We spend $150 billion per year on illegal immigrants welfare. Even if wall only stopped half of it, that's $75 billion per year that can go towards the things you speak of. Can you imagine how far that can go? WOW!!!! You're not just real bright are you?
yes Jordan Miller have you ever thought about the fact that the driver was drunk? He was obviously going very fast if he hit her that hard and some terrains make it hard to see when people are coming down the street. Shame on you for having absolutely no soul and saying it was her fault.
no Stay strong Mr. President. We the people still support you. Thank you for standing up for us.
no Betsy Hammond  I am a diabetic I pay for insurance and still have to pay for it!!! I still want the wall and back my President!  He is NOT to blame for the high insurance costs thank Obama the worthless one He did that to you NOT Trump!!! So jump on Obamas page and let him k ow how you struggle. Trump works for FREE for Americans he can only fix things obama destroyed so fast
yes Danny Jones One angel family does not a crisis make!!!!  Trump declares national emergency...  Nobodys done the job that weve done on the border,  said Donny as he declares a national emergency today........the slowest emergency in history.  And with the lawsuits that will ensue, his wall will not be funded or built until after the next election...if ever.  THE WORLDS SLOWEST EMERGENCY!!!!!  Donny lied directly to Americans about his border crisis.  Our Liar-in-Chief said that all the data that refutes his crisis designation is lies.  Got that?  Our president told the American people that THE FACTS ARE LIES...this is what all wannabe dictators say.  This egomaniac is THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!  Donny doesnt seem terribly concerned about this crisis.  He plans to travel to Florida mere hours after declaring the emergency from the White House. A president, in times of strife, would typically stay in the nations capital to oversee the crisis. Donny plans to do so from the comfort of his weekend getaway.  In reality, Donny is preparing the country for a fake war as he plans to enjoy a mini vacation. The only national emergency in America right now is one of leadership!!
yes Yes, build the Wall.
no Chuck Brantley  You're the one lowering your standards by attacking and calling names. It's apparent that's all you got. Most adults would be embarrassed to act in such a childlike manner. Same with Lyle, maybe you'll mature enough some day to hold an adult conversation.
no what? smh
yes So sorry ! We need the WALL! We Need Immigration Over-haul
no Where do u get info?CNN???
yes Thank you ! I appreciate everything you do !
yes Dale Murphy Im sorry you dont care. Thanks for sharing your opinion on executive overreach with a clever gif.
no It's called Checkmate!!!
no But if that illegal immigrant wouldn't have been here...
no I was injured in a car accident caused by an illegal immigrant. 13 years later I still have mobility issues because of it. A couple months before, a cop who was a member at my church was shot and killed during a routine traffic stop. He was murdered by a kid who was deported 9 times. He left behind a wife and infant. I am a supporter of the wall! Thank you Trump!
no The most irrational view
no Amen!  Build that wall!
yes We would not need walls if we were not in the need of penitentiary terms !!
no Well I wont be a politician later but yeah it was obviously a statement on the president priorities. Gun control might be a bigger problem in the US considering the thousands of deads it could save every year. But I guess now it's all about our opinions, values and interpretations of the stats about each of these issues
yes if the Senators and the state doesn't want the wall built let's put their houses down there along the border it for the governors in the Senators to live in and then let's see if they want to build the wall
no Del Cueto added that he wants a secure border for the same reason people lock their doors at home:  "Because we love the people inside, not because we hate the people outside," he said.
no Troops do not view immigration as a national emergency. Not even close. 60 percent of active-duty troops say immigration is either a small threat to U.S. national security or no threat at all. Likewise, 77 percent view Mexico as a small threat or none whatsoever. VoteVets.org
no seim of y ramp yar migrant tu
no Priorities
yes Perry Hess sure lol most republiCONS are gun owners not dems retard
yes Dear Mr. Trump, millions of soldiers including 58,000 Americans who died in the Vietnam war.  We are suffering from the brutality of communist 's regime.  Please help to free us.  We want FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHS FOR VIETNAM, Please!
no Sorry for your lost build the wall
yes Tony Connelly I agree with you. Between medical issues, underinsured/uninsured people not being able to afford medication and medial attention they need and gun violence due to untreated mental illness we have a real crisis.   If we want to stop most illegal immigration we just need to start putting the people who hire them in jail. it doesn't even have to be long, it could be as short as 30 days. however this would put a concrete consequences behind hiring an illegal.
no Trump ur just as bad as cnn. Lets remind the worl how many Americans ate people and buried people . Also many more evil crimes. Lets build a wall is like locking us all in a cell with these American killers. The kkk set nonwhites on fire and tied them to a tree but there able to roam free . Good one trump
yes Albert J Destefanis he is the swamp
no Hey like the dems say about guns, if we save one life it's worth it.  
yes Her father is the one who said to not use her death for political reasons....
yes I SUPPORT ALL YOUR EFFORTS MR. PRESIDENT. GOD BLESS YOU.
no Mr. President Trump  ....... Now is the time. Our Great and Loving Country is THE PLACE, and our people before politics are the United States of America ...THIS is the STAND against treason, tyranny and TIME against us. It's your move Sir.
yes The Berlin Wall worked really well
no Lol
yes Pewlosi is the pockets of the Mexican drug cartels
yes A legal citizen shot and killed 5 Americans yesterday.
yes U might want to look at your gun problem as something requiring the recognition of a national emergency before letting a wall jump the que... u do know thats not the only way they get in?
no If that wall saves one person it will be worth every penny!!   #buildthewall
no If Trump had used the reversed theory, walls don't work, let's take them down, the democrats would have the entire wall done by now. They know they work, but they can't agree with him on anything. So sad.
yes Never Never a Wall
no Dave Thompson Yes they are Americans.  South Americans to be precise.  But they are NOT UNITED STATES  CITIZENS!  They are CITIZENS of the country they came from and chose to come here ILLEGALLY.  They should have done it the RIGHT way.  APPLY for CITIZENSHIP!!!
yes Did Daniel Zuniga illegally cross the border on foot in an area we dont currently have walls or come here legally and over stay their Visa?
no Why isn't 40,000 Americans killed by handguns alone last year count as a national emergency/ Why isn't 340 mass shootings last year a national emergency?
yes I hate to say it, if this happened to a couple of liberal politicians family members we would see action!
yes I wouldn't call it a crisis, but a major concern that should have been dealt with decades ago. But it's funny how the Democrats flipped suddenly on their debate tactics for this issue. Any other issue and they dig deep and pull out all the unique tragedies and cry about how terrible it is for this one person, so we should change society just for them. However, Trump decides to play the emotion card and he's called a liar and every other name in the book. He's playing the game they invented. What poor sports.
yes Thank you Mr President/Vice for protecting the AMERICAN Citizen. What can we do end the attacks of those anti trumpers.
yes I have lived in the Rio Grande Valley my entire life. Live about 10 minutes from Mexico, never had any issues with illegal aliens. Trump made it a point to exclude all the local mayors from his border visit. Mayors from Brownsville, Harlingen and McAllen are all against this wall, as well as I. Creating a crisis, where there isnt one! More people have died by the hands of homegrown mass murdering terrorists than illegal aliens! No wall for me please!
yes Ed Basler how many of those are big pharmaceuticals fault?
no Cert
yes Sueli Rossi  - you can't trust the Dems, but you believe every word that comes out if 45's mouth when almost everything he says can be be easily proven to be a lie? Now that's a special kind of stupid.
yes God bless you Donald Trump. In Nigeria my country, the president value cows more than humans, the reason why we want him out.
yes stop using people
no CNN, hired by Democrats, insists on trying to ruin White House's fervent campaign for the construction of the wall on the border, CNN has never praised anything positive made by US President Donald J. Trump, or supported the conquest in the American economy, has always tried to campaign against any measure approved by the American people. The Wall should be built not to prohibit new immigrants in America, it's on the contrary, the Wall should be built to open doors for legal immigrants who want to live in America, following rules and conditioning themselves to live on the American flag in law and constituent order for good citizens. Build the Wall.
no Hal Eric Mitlitsky Trump is above you
yes Renee ladd magee you've been watching too much Fox news, there is nowhere in Europe that has sharia law. I live in a uk city which has a large ethnic community, and you it has problems but its problems driven by unemployment and low paid jobs not what race or which god someone follows. Do not the US have the same issues in its inner cities ?
yes we don't , we just know spending $25 BILLION on a wall will  NOT stop people entering the country illegally ,  most illegals are visa over stayers but trump is not addressing that he just wants a wall to keep votes off morons like you two
yes Larry Martin nope
yes God bless you President Trump! Trump 2020
no Stephen King they do its called jail lots of fencing and Wall!!!
yes https://www.axios.com/us-budget-deficit-spikes-fiscal-year-1e946342-c3bd-4ae0-892b-fb9747580277.html?fbclid=IwAR0_r933rSW2fq1va1fy9GkcaST_ieZjhw7kfjZrVtkmNLZPT8B1rNpqXOw
no Shut your lying ass up.
yes Many years ago, a friend of mines step brother was killed in a car accident by an illegal. He fled to Mexico. Never was caught
no That and distracting from the Russian thing.
no Not even a shoe of the wrong size will fit by force
no ^^^* 'We'; {average American citizen's}... need to bring light to EVERY occurrence of an; 'Illegal Alien' murdering a 'American Citizen'.  And then make sure that the entire World knows.  That 'IT' 'IS' the unequivocally /and/ specifically that 'FAULT' of; 'Nancy Pelosi' / 'Chuck Schumer' /and/ Anyone that did not vote to fund the 'Border Wall'!!!!!!  *Through Their neglect... have the Blood of innocent people on Their hands!!!!!!! :'(  *> When will They {Liberal's} be prosecuted for; 'Complicit Neglect in conjunction of a Homicide'!?!?!?! >:(
yes No trump is wrong and he can not be trusted to tell the truth any longer. Thousands of Illegal immigrant's cross the boarder at our check points every week right now, it just takes cash and a connection, a longer wall in the desert will not help at all.
yes What a waste of money...... Wake up folks!
no WE support you, President Trump...and do not want to see any more people in America become Angel Moms and Dads!
yes Craig Peterson what American problems because of Americans.  Hmmmmmm?
no https://www.facebook.com/roguepressbriefs/photos/a.219075375254770/550355752126729/?type=3&theater
no Haha,you would date Ivanka if she wasnt your daughter,give me a fricken break
yes John Steele The real question is Does Mexico love God, isnt it? God answers prayers to those who pray.
yes this is happening WAY too often!
yes Emil Drr he's not going to prison, it will be too full of Obama and his entire administration.
yes Nice God blass You famly
yes Mr. Trump you're a beautiful Angel of the Lord with hair as Golden as my Sunrise.
yes Yes Mr Trump. Protect Americans first. Even the Dumbacraps that can only Take from the American people. Then lets move on to more issues like big pharma and infrastructure. One thing at a time. You have 6 more yrs and its going to be a battle with the obstructing we know.
no BUILD THE WALL! Up Pelosi's ass with a piece of glass!!!!
no https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/why-wall-wont-work
no Exactly. Or the 5 shot dead in Illinois yesterday.
yes Yesterday in Aurora IL American citizen killed 5 people and wounded couple more including police officers. So I can suggest a wall between every single county
yes Sheikh F Shahel Obama declared countless NEs only to help other countries. He is detrimental to the U.S. I was never outlandish or butthurt like you scumbag liberals are towards Trump.. I kept my mouth shut for 8 long years.. Maybe you should try that too
yes No border...no country ! Walls work! So, so sorry for your loss! Prayers go out to you and your family! Thank God we have a strong, courageous  President  in President Trump  who loves all Americans and our Beloved Counrty. He saved our Country!  #TRUMP2020  #WAWY
no Darrel James Be more specific? White,black, male,female,young,old,etc?
no A $10B wall is worth more than a $4.5B pipeline that doesn't exist. What can it hurt?
no Justin Fields   Sorry, Justin!!!   PRESIDENT TRUMP, THANK YOU FOR PUTTING AMERICA FIRST ON EVERY DECISION YOU MAKE!!!!! 
yes Does God not like Mexico then? Is he only helping America?
no They won't even meet with the angel parents.
no Weo is it to much for a politician to do what he said he was gonna do
no I don't understand why no one (including President Trump, media, etc) never use the fact that there are caravans of people headed for our southern border with the intentions of entering our country one way or the other.  To me, that alone is a crisis in itself!
yes Jimmy Kimmel has walls around his house but yet the piece of trash talks crap about our great president!! Trump 2020...
yes Kimberly Mansfield  there is NO gun problem, it is a people problem. People have no respect for others, authority or human life.
yes The house will fall
yes Rob Egerton right on that abortions kill thousands a day.
yes What are we going to do with our home grown terrorists?
yes Correction:. Protection for American WHITE CHRISTIAN RICH families are your priority.
no Sheep
yes If you build a wall, illegal immigrants will come with a boat. And boat owners will make huge money by human trafficking, some poor illegal immigrant children will die by drowning, because boat owners will receive more people than the capacity. Another drama will start. Do you really want this? In other countries this is happening. wall is not the solution..
no Danny Jones your culture must be trash.    Why are you garbage humans?
yes Yolanda Copac like trump worked with others LOL he shut the government down like the spoiled brat he is
no https://www.facebook.com/TheOther98/photos/a.115969958413991/2498507526826877/?type=3&theater
yes Thank you Mr Trump .for caring about the USA and its citizens. Build that Wall..and deport.
yes TRUMP IS AWESOME!
no I stand with you
yes Cant build the wall fast enough.
yes So true Democrats don't care at all for them self
yes Ed Wrany do you ever get tired of posting the same tired old bullshit sentence . He is the worst president ever, hands down. He's an idiot that is in over his head and he's driving us into disaster.  Wtf is wrong with drumpf turds? Were you dropped on your head as infants? Jezzzz....
no Estefania Torres Restrepo you aren't very bright are you. 94 percent of border agents, the head of the border union, the chief and 8 out of 10 border mayors all stated a wall helps. Please research before spewing ignorant rhetoric. Btw, I would be embarrassed if my heritage invaded a country where most don't speak English, have no skill, cost the American Tax Payers billions and wouldn't assimilate
yes Brandon Turner the wall is another tool we need and want. Would you rather us on the border shoot the trespassers?
no Prayers for everyone who have lost loved ones because of illegal aliens. This is absolutely insane. Thankfully, I don't know anyone who has been harmed by an illegal but I am still for the wall. Walls are good. Walls help with many things. The people against to wall are - well, I won't put it in print - but one day it's going to affect them and we'll see how their opinion is then. So many people hate this president more than they love their country. God bless the friends and family affected and God bless our president and those trying to help.
yes So horrible!!  100%!!  Build the wall!
yes Their kids are already brain dead
yes Lies...... Lies...... Lies...........
no Larry Lubiner why?? Because it's true?
yes Because are people too
yes Or she could have been at the VEGAS outdoor concert. RIP
no https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2019/02/16/us/illinois-aurora-shooting/index.html
no https://youtu.be/u9UTTh6PPIg Only one ALLAH responds to his name.
no Mr T you are the best thing America has produced  Build the wall, right round America, no-one in, no-one out.  
yes Yes they will. Has anyone noticed Fox News is sounding more like CNN everyday?
yes That's our New way of life Now .  We open Season .  The wild Country of 1800's
yes YES BUILD THE WALL NO MORE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
no Eva Graham One angel family does not a crisis make!!!!  Trump declares national emergency...  Nobodys done the job that weve done on the border,  said Donny as he declares a national emergency today........the slowest emergency in history.  And with the lawsuits that will ensue, his wall will not be funded or built until after the next election...if ever.  THE WORLDS SLOWEST EMERGENCY!!!!!  Donny lied directly to Americans about his border crisis.  Our Liar-in-Chief said that all the data that refutes his crisis designation is lies.  Got that?  Our president told the American people that THE FACTS ARE LIES...this is what all wannabe dictators say.  This egomaniac is THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!  Donny doesnt seem terribly concerned about this crisis.  He plans to travel to Florida mere hours after declaring the emergency from the White House. A president, in times of strife, would typically stay in the nations capital to oversee the crisis. Donny plans to do so from the comfort of his weekend getaway.  In reality, Donny is preparing the country for a fake war as he plans to enjoy a mini vacation. The only national emergency in America right now is one of leadership!!
yes thats so stupid twat head libtard'
yes Bill Rahbine and what if your daughter was ever to get murdered by a illegal that's in a cartel ?  1 against .. what ? 50 thugs ? ... that wouldn't work out .
no KEEP US SAFE MR. PRESIDENT, BUILD THE WALL.
yes Thank you!!
no CBS newscasters needs to refer to our President as President Trump and not Mr. Trump. You dont have to like him but respect that he has the top position in the country.
yes TRUMP 2020
no Exactly sir
no Even the Mexican citizens don't want them and are telling them to go back where they came from...it is a problem...lots are unruly young men...the wall will at least funnel them to places they can be turned around...oh...congress fixed that...now they stay...but forgot the $$$ in that bill to care for and house the ones turned loose in our beautiful country...sad situation.
yes It is not an iligal immigrant, it is an illegal criminal that crossed our boarder. California state government should be charged with harboring these criminals. Take their statehood away and put them back in territory status.
yes I see this everyday hearing illegals tell me that the us pays there house cars and on food stamps.
no Ceilings work. Floors work. trump works for rich people.
no Linda Durbin TRAITOR TRUMP, PUTIN OWNED!!
no This makes my heart cry! Im behind building walls everywhere to keep out the gangs, the criminals and all people who enter illegally!
yes Five dead in Illinois by gun violence. Far more deaths each year by gun violence and drug abuse. But sure.... lets pretend a wall will solve it all.
yes Absolutely they work, BUILD THE WALL PRESIDENT TRUMP!
no The democrats dont care about the victims of crimes comited by illegals to Americans
no Christine M Terry you need you're head examed he will not get in for a second term he is trying too start a recession and that will cause a riot so shut up
no what nonsense stop using a rare event for fascism, may she rest in peace
yes We have the right to be protected, I'm sorry for your losses.....
no Isaiah 54:17
yes Alberto Weisz you cant take your door down but not because of illegal immigrants because of American citizens
yes A wall would not have kept this from happening. :/
yes My moms first husband was gunned down by a illegal machine gun, but I dont see yall taking gun violence on as seriously...
no We need the wall.
yes The government has no right telling a women what they should do with their bodies!
yes Stacey Britton you mean showing proof that we need border security?
no Tell that to Israel, their wall works just fine!
no Carl Ostendarp STFU -- obama went golfing 8min. after one of our journalists was beheaded .https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/22/us/politics/a-terrorist-horror-then-golf-incongruity-fuels-obama-critics.html
yes Curtis Rice Your stats are fake. We have the worst gangs from central America now because we are to free with our immigration polices.
yes We will still need to stop sanctuary cities and asylum laws so vote for people right and left who will change the laws
no Get that wall built, however you have to do it.  You have my vote in 2020.
no Mr President sir, how I wish the same energy and attention given to building walls are also channel on protecting American families through the amendment of GUN control laws. Problems are easier solved when tackled from the main source.
no If this were an anecdotal comment, I would disregard it.  However, this has happened to tens, nay, hundreds of people, even many thousands when one considers drug overdoses.  Stop illegal entry into our country!  Thank you President Trump.   Warm regards from south Florida.
no Anthony Clark maybe make your city and state do there jobs ?
yes President Trump build the wall!
no How do we feel safe from home grown slaughterers?
yes And the wall was there?
no Thank you Trump!
yes yeah, and hundreds if not thousands killed by gun nuts....but, crickets, ugh
yes America is truly a fucked up place. Thousands of Americans are shot by other Americans. You do nothing about gun control but are happy to spend millions to keep a handful of criminals out rather than deal with the ones youve already got.
no No your personal agenda has nothing to do with protecting American families - you just don't want to avoid standing out as a the loser you are and always will be. You simply don't have what it takes to be great - not even to make America great again. The only thing you have managed to make really great is America's debt of $21.97 trillion.
yes I support the President and the wall
no Simon Kitson I guess posing nude and marrying for money makes you smart
yes I live in McAllen, Texas. NO OTHER PRESIDENT has come here other than President Clinton, but all Clinton came here for was a fund raising event. THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP!!!
yes Hey Junior - what next? Burning books?  https://youtu.be/mpPaAUFNdNkDonald Trump Jr. Calls Teachers LOSERS At Rally With His Dadyoutube.com
yes Dale Murphy
yes Ed Barnat grow up.
yes BTW, he did not do this out of hate... he did it as a cost saving measure for his country.
yes God bless you Donald Trump.
no Jess Castrejn f@#& you ass hole
no BRAVO BURT LANCHESTER  BOMBER WHINCHESTER THE DUKE BIG JOHN MCCAIN
no Never in American history have elected officials, elected by Americans, fought so hard for people who are not Americans and didn't vote for them.  These are your Democrats today.  Disgusting and pathetic.
no I'm so sorry! :(
no What about the families of the 5 murdered in Aurora IL yesterday by an American?
yes we need the wall built it is a disgrace to the United States of America what has happened to the Democratic party they have destroyed their selves they are hypocrites and Liars the truth is coming out they tried to overthrow our government
yes Listen, Santa....
no Art Jackson please show me those facts.
yes Like all Presidents have said in the past, they can live here but do it legally. Why is that so hard to understand.
no We are with you President Donald J. Trump you are doing a great job.Please know that there are many of us who are praying for you!
no Yes build the wall.
no https://i.imgur.com/gfLTReH.png
no Maureen Hersey Brown you wouldn't because you have never been opressed, your people just stole and killed to get what the want.  The are not illegals, they are human beings, and God created them just as be created you.  You are not from this land dear so when you go back to Europe and make a comment it would be worth listening to until then, stfu.
no Daniel Alexander Allen  well said
yes I feel so very hurt for you.  The Wall will lessen the chances of such  a criminal to be on our streets .. Words can not comfort  you with such pain in your heart. But a Wall will prevent this in the future ...
no Dont you try and tell me there is no crisis at the border.
no BUILD THE WALL!!
yes It's not just about drugs and murders. It's about the fact people are coming in illegally. What is so hard to grasp about the word "ILLEGAL?"
no I'm for legal immigration ,and against illegal immigration .I don't know if the wall is good way to stop it . I do know if we imprisoned and fined employers that hire them, it would be more cost effective . After a few arrest and imprisonoment of employers , manager  , the rest of the employers will fall in line ,problem solved . This would be more humane, and much cheaper ,but neither party is willing to do anything about it because The US Chamber of Commerce has been able to lobby against the implemetation of e verify . Wall or no wall ,the truth is neither party really want to solve the problem and the wall is only a costly diversion
yes YES!!!
no Are you talking to your wacko birds, Trump? You think they'll swallow anything you say? You can't con all the people all the time."As a percentage of their respective populations, there were 56 percent fewer criminal convictions of illegal immigrants than of native-born Americans in Texas in 2015," author Alex Nowrasteh writes. "The criminal conviction rate for legal immigrants was about 85 percent below the native-born rate."
no Ed Wrany Worst and more corrupt president in 5e history of our country.
yes Charles Boyd JFC another delusional one who believes in the communist utopia of no guns except for the govt will keep us safe BS. Guess what- the govt doesnt give a damn about you. You are a liability to them and liabilities are expendable. Learn your history boy.
yes So far as I can tell, its only the democrats that does not want the wall. There are some that keeps asking me about it.
no God killed your daughter. He would have done it through any human.
yes When Democrats dismiss the fact that illegal immigrants are killing citizens , they are really admitting that there is an acceptable number of victims. I think they would feel differently if it were their family member who wound up a victim. That is completely unacceptable.
no I hardly think President Hoax should be praised for working hard playing golf and watching TV while neglecting his presidential duties!!!
yes Charles Gibson    We already have the BEST President protecting America.  We are a Nation of Laws....just like weve always had but previous presidents havent enforced.
yes Does any one else find the photo strange? The man doesn't even look human
yes Sad some think so little of innocent Americans
yes Protect us from Russia then jerk. And btw without illegals, you would never have any of your wife's or people cleaning your hotels and resorts idiot
yes I'm not saying building a wall is useless just saying they will find a way to get over it or under it. Just common sense that's all.
yes Sheikh F Shahel hello
no Larry Burford what does that have to do with this . So you want more killing to enter the US while we have enouph of our own . Juarez mexico is on the list of the most dangerous cities behind our border . You are really thinking crazy ! The border isnt even secure there either . If the walls come down they become part of our country . Think about that . They can walk right over .
no To quote liberals gun control mantra, ...if just one life is saved... but in this case the wall will actually be a net gain in saved lives.
yes So thankful for you
yes I'm so sorry for your loss!
yes fake news
yes Deport all immigrants they are all trouble we can do without.
yes Mr. Trump! destroy the deep state and build the wall!
no So sorry for your loss , and also the other parents who needlessly, have had their hearts broken , and families fractured !   
yes So it is a competition?! One is not as bad as the other?! It matters when some son-of-a-bitch guns you down?! What an asshat! What part of ILLEGAL ALIEN border jumper, who is not supposed to be here to begin with, do you not get?! As in if the illegals were not here they could not kill anyone you mental midget! This has to be the most ridiculous, stupid comment I have ever read!
no Then WHY on Earth did you sign that bill!
no PROPAGANDA!!!!!
no Chris Hall "if it saves one life it's worth it" does that mean you are also in favor of stricter gun control laws since it will save at least one life? What about the lives of baby immigrants that have died in the custody of the government? Will we end the practice of family separation to save those one lives as well? What about the asylum seekers that would die if not granted asylum into our country? Will we reform our asylum and immigration policies to save those one lives? You say a wall of it saves one life is worth it... then you should apply that principle equally to all lives.
yes Go camping at the border with your kid I dare you
no So sorry for your loss. We need walls!
no My heart weeps for them, and agree. Hopefully the people that El Paso is building units for, until they get processed won't be that. It's being told it's for Women and Children and the fact is that its more male than female or children. But you are all we got and you have the answers but sure don't agree with it but will back you...
no James Anderson or Australia? they banned guns no mass shootings since !!   infact none of the G20 have anything near our gun slaughter every week-why is that..  oh yes NO 2nd amendment....
no Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
no Victoria Deobald, Trump needs to explain why he didn't have Hillary arrested as he promised.  Instead, those who he surrounded himself with have been arrested jailed & sentenced.  This is the most corrupt White House in history!    75 INDICTMENTS
no Michelle Novak Clearly, my dear, they don't give a damn.
yes Yes use those poor unfortunate people for your corrupt political purposes. Meanwhile mass shootings go on daily all over the United States perpetrated by Americans.
yes My janitorial company sends MR,Trump money for the wall each month . We just made another donation today.   Praise the Lord! We have a president that cares.
no Your only priority is your own advancement and legacy.
no My sympathies.  I really wonder how Pelosi and the rest of the demorats live with themselves.  I guess they don't consider us to worth the worry.
yes Jess Castrejn MAD is a group who does address this #MOTHERSAGAINSTDRUNKDRIVERS.
yes Sam North Obviously we can keep out our own citizens idiot but we can keep out Illegals! Did you even read how stupid your post sounded before you posted it? Did you mom tell you as she put you on the little yellow bus every morning that it was for the smarter kids at your school Sam? Like wow?
yes Build a wall around DC instead
yes is reasonable gun control on your list?
yes The complicit media wants to cover this up
yes exactly and enough with this "undocumented workers" workers is hardly the word to describe them. ILLEGAL ALIENS is more appropriate and it was used without any problems for years.
yes Temicka Brown  Ok, done! Included your FB address and a pictures
no Joan Travis the amazing thing is all the previous real national emergencies received bipartisan support from Congress.
yes Thank you for your dedication and service to the American people.. we all ( except the crazy ones) stand behind you all the way... Blessings to you and your family always....
no We stand with you Mr.President.
no I do not understand people how do not want to see the huge problem here ? Scary and sad Build the wall MEGA 2020
yes Thank you, Mr. President!  
yes Liz fisher, don't be sorry for him I'm from the UK and he is talking rubbish
no It's hard to convince people who never had to felt it. Loosing something you were not suppose to. Do they need to see people they love die to understand that something isn't right?  To have saw it more than once, when it happen, YOU FUCKING CHANGES OF PERSPECTIVE. So now get the wall cause' lifes depent on it and you have all authority just look at all those case that the democrat CLEARY DON'T WANNA DEFEND.  But no problem defending illegal immigrants? And not building the wall?  IF YOU DON'T BUILD THE WALL THEN YOU CLEARY DONT LOVE THE US!
no So sorry for your loss it's not right that some one illegal can come into our country and take the lives of our own people!!  This is so wrong!!
yes I'm tired of illegals taking jobs from Americans for absolutely dirt cheap pay... The electrical field is hard work but people like my self are willing to work them. But we are tired of fixing their horrible work and not just bad, but dangerous work, not meeting the proper city codes...
no The best president ever #gotrump
yes Sorry about your daughter may she Rip
no Build the wall! Then throw all liberal progressive socialist democrats and all Islam on the south side of it.
yes And they have consequences.  They do get deported so they can come right back and do it again.  Maybe if we took care of Americans and focused on mental health, we could save some lives.  There's an idiot idea
yes Danny Jones you are so ignorant, we get more money back from the EU in trade and services than we ever put in, let alone in educational, scientific, defense, farming, policing and more cross border programs. The EU protects and enriches national identity and culture. And frankly if one day we can destroy dumb macho lad culture, the UK will be better off.
yes Jim LaMuth its Presidents Day weekend idiot. The real national emergency is that gay a*ss sweater your wearing
no An American citizen killed 17 kids in Parkland Fl,
yes Thank you.
no We owe it to her and all the others who's lives were snuffed out by people who didn't give a dang a out our laws. Let's build that wall!
yes So many lies from the habitual liar and charlatan that it's exhausting and hard to keep up.
yes Aint no damn illegal aliens gonna mess with my family or it will be the last thing they ever do. #DontMessWithMyFamily.
yes What's good for Democrats is bad for America...everybody knows this.Democrats are now an adversary of the U.S. and like any enemy of the U.S. they care nothing about National Security and Public Safety..
yes Just do it!
yes Jason O'neal  A lot just cross the desert, usually the really bad ones with records too
yes BTW, if we secure the 1900+ miles of open territory these border jumpers can just walk through, BP could focus more resources on tunnels! I had not heard that caravans of 10,000 invaders were coming in through the tunnels or landing at the airports! You asshat!
no God bless those whom we have lost due to no security at our boarder.  We have needed border security for 30 years and immigration reform to which nothing has never been done. This has been an emergency the entire time and no one had the wherewithal to do it. I COMMEND President Trump for finally taking action.    TRUMP 2020
yes It's better to look into this Trump.  Before things get out of hand
no Thank you Mr President.
no Jane Mitchell Why? Because the Fuhrer says so?!!
yes Take a good look at that. It's not just extreme christian humility. It's a world paradigm of caring and sharing.
no the only reason that the corrupt politicians are being allowed to destroy our country is because we are letting them..people have to wake up and get involved...congress will never pass any legislation that stops their corruption...if you are serious about wanting to drain the swamp then you need to get involved with the Convention of States. don't just leave everything to trump because the swamp is too deep for him to drain without our help.. please take the time to learn about the Convention of States and get involved... see Convention of States on facebook to learn more..please get everyone involved..
no Trump start out by saying lets build a wall. Are you a Trump supporters cheered him on. Now Trump is saying lets finish the wall. Again all you Trump supporters are cheering him on.   He hasnt even started to build the wall. But now you guys are cheering him on to finish it.  All Trump has to do is say he finish the wall.  You Trump supporters walk again cheer him on.  So why doesnt he just do that.  All this nonsense will be over.
no Estefania Torres Restrepo you grow up
yes 9K Likes in 15 minutes? How am I supposed to talk to this guy?
yes BUILDTHEWALL
no What??? Cmon, Ronnie, give me something better than that!
yes Sue Howie no it was about 4 foot tall and my dog gave up. Not all dogs would give up but he did and if the wall stops one criminal, one death then BUILD IT. Its not about Hate.
no Johntavious Williams well it wasn't! So why create a fake narrative! Troll!
yes Christine Huggard Roach which doctor....there were several,as anyone who has undiagnosed illness knows.By the Grace of God.........
yes If even one can be prevented. How do we not enforce the laws!!!
no How many Americans kill other American?
yes How did these immigrants get here? Probably at a port of entry. El Paso's crime level has increased since a wall was put up.
yes This is sickening, then to hear Schumer and Pelosi say the border is not a crisis for our country !!!!!!!!!!
no I sure wish trump would speak up for the families who lost loved ones to gun violence by Americans.
yes AM JUST LOOKING FOR SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP
no Thanks for walling the world's largest cartel in with us. Also for giving them a huge tax break
yes Here is a little morning history for you. Very interesting...  Thomas Jefferson His portrait is on the $2.00 Dollar Bill. This is amazing. There are two parts to this. Be sure to read the 2nd part.  Thomas Jefferson was a very remarkable man who started learning very early in life and never stopped. At 5, began studying under his cousin ' s tutor. At 9, studied Latin, Greek and French. At 14, studied classical literature and additional languages At 16, entered the College of William and Mary. Also could write in Greek with one hand, while writing the same in Latin with the other. At 19, studied Law for 5 years starting under George Wythe. At 23, started his own law practice. At 25, was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses. At 31, wrote the widely circulated "Summary View of the Rights of British America," and retired from his law practice. At 32, was a delegate to the Second Continental Congress. At 33, wrote the Declaration of Independence. At 33, took three years to revise Virginia ' s legal code and wrote a Public Education bill and a statute for Religious Freedom. At 36, was elected the second Governor of Virginia, succeeding Patrick Henry. At 40, served in Congress for two years. At 41, was the American minister to France and negotiated commercial treaties with European nations along with Ben Franklin and John Adams. At 46, served as the first Secretary of State under George Washington. At 53, served as Vice President and was elected President of the American Philosophical Society. At 55, drafted the Kentucky Resolutions and became the active head of the Republican Party. At 57, was elected the third president of the United States  At 60, obtained the Louisiana Purchase , doubling the nation ' s size. At 61, was elected to a second term as President. At 65, retired to Monticello. At 80, helped President Monroe shape the Monroe Doctrine. At 81, almost single-handedly, created the University of Virginia and served as its ' first president. At 83, died on the 50th Anniversary of the Signing of the Declaration of Independence, along with John Adams.  Thomas Jefferson knew because he himself studied, the previous failed attempts at government. He understood actual history, the nature of God, His laws and the nature of man. That happens to be way more than what most understand today.  Jefferson really knew his stuff.  A voice from the past to lead us in the future:  John F. Kennedy held a dinner in the White House for a group of the brightest minds in the nation at that time. He made this statement: "This is perhaps the assembly of the most intelligence ever to gather at one time in the White House, with the exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone."  "When we get piled upon one another in large cities, as in Europe, we shall become as corrupt as Europe ." -- Thomas Jefferson  "The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not." -- Thomas Jefferson  "It is incumbent on every generation to pay its ' own debts as it goes. A principle which if acted on, would save one-half the wars of the world." -- Thomas Jefferson  "I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people, under the pretense of taking care of them." -- Thomas Jefferson  "My reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government." -- Thomas Jefferson  "No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms." -- Thomas Jefferson  "The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government." -- Thomas Jefferson  "The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants." -- Thomas Jefferson  "To compel a man to subsidize with his taxes, the propagation of ideas which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical." -- Thomas Jefferson
yes Go tell her parents that Adrian Vargas
yes Drunk driver killed my friend...crush all vehicles except Ambulances and Fire Trucks
yes An emergency declaration ought to be reserved for legitimate emergency situations where quick, decisive action is needed to resolve a crisis.  Trump's failure to win approval for his vanity project does not constitute a national emergency.  Typically, when someone is facing a legitimate emergency, they wouldn't undermine their own argument for exercising emergency powers by admitting that the situation is such that they don't actually need to declare an emergency.  Trump is truly such a special case, that he deftly made the case for his "emergency" declaration by admitting, "I could do the wall over a longer period of time, I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster. And I don't have to do it for the election; I've already done a lot of wall for the election 2020."  Later in the same address, Trump basically admitted that his emergency declaration will not result in his Wall being built quickly.  If we are genuinely experiencing a border crisis that requires an emergency declaration from Trump, how is it that Trump was able to wait until nearly 25 months into his administration before declaring an emergency?  If the situation is so dire, and requires prompt, decisive action, exactly how will construction of a wall that would take several years to complete address the issue in time?   Sever dehydration is a medical emergency. Would you advise someone suffering from severe dehydration to begin development of a well to deal with their thirst, or would you give them a glass of water?  How do you justify building Trump's Wall to deter border crossings, when apprehensions at the southern border are near a 46 year low?  What good will Trump's Wall do to curb drug smuggling across the border, when both the DEA and the CBP admit that most of the narcotics that cross the southern border come through legal ports of entry?  How effective will Trump's Wall be at preventing undocumented immigrants from entering the country, when the Center for Migration Studies of New York found that in 2016-2017, 62% of the newly undocumented were folks who had overstayed their visas, and not crossed our southern border illegally?   How would Trump's Wall address the refugee crisis, when it won't provide any of the resources needed to process and adjudicate asylum claims, nor will it lead to a resolution of the circumstances refugees are fleeing in their homelands?  "Build the Wall!" was never a real solution. It was a slogan.  Trump'a Wall has always been a simplistic remedy offered by an ignorant sleaze in order to appeal to the simple-minded.
no Bullshit Mr President Bullshit you are.  Fuckin liar but your the best we got in office. Raise the bar. And get Barr to. Prosecute crimes of those in the public trust
no Danny Jones $157 billion a year to support illegals vs $5 billion to keep them out is ok with me
yes Im soo very sorry , my heart breaks for you and all the families that have lost a loved one .  Enough, political games , Build this wall thousands have been sacrificed because of this !!!
no He is doing the right thing!  Its long past due!  Its been talked to death  thank God Trump is a doer!  So sorry for your tragic lose
yes 1 death in my opinion is an emergency.
yes When have I not name called ? Wouldn't be me if I wasn't trying to offend you
yes Feel badly for the family but would be curious to know if they were democrats will they still vote democrat.
no Build the wall Protect our family our children
yes Worst president
no Americans with guns have killed thousands.   99.9% of deaths in America are from white Americans!
yes Yolanda Copac agreed!! Quit being a Democrat Quit being a Republican Quit bashing the current Pres and The last 44  Start being an American Live by the Constitution and Bill Of Rights  Worship a Higher Being and Remember the What America was built on  Know your enemy and who has fought for all those rights  America.. has it is now (my opinion.. not open for interpretation or discussion) is in a state of peril as well as state of emergency
yes Make no mistake, Trump couldn't care less about Americans.  You're a fool if you believe his lies.
yes You're lying stop it.
no TRAITOR
yes Danny Jones you know what else the UK can get with $5 billion? A decent dental plan for all of its citizens. Maybe you should worry about that first, and let us worry about our wall.
yes I think you'll fine Danny doesn't know what he is talking about
yes This is not ok. If President Obama has said this, it would be Ok.....but not you President Trump. Nothing is Ok if it come out of your mouth. The media and the liberal socialist in this country Ill make sure of itz
no Ok  if you say so I'll just do the usual and send my thoughts and prayers since that's what's always done in these situations
yes Yes the problem is bigger than the Illegals,  1 big bite will be a start.
no Yes we do !  percent a.s.a.p
yes If people don't like the thought of a wall then why don't we open all the prison in America they are behind a wall or barrier for some reason or let someone walk thru your front door without knocking what is wrong with you people we need to protect our country everyone one needs to come the same way as our ancestors did legally
no Craig Wahlberg
yes Jacqueline Alas doesnt count they just claim mental issues or there problemd lives. Very sad.
yes If they had barriers for 1900 plus miles of WIDE OPEN territory where illegal border jumpers can just walk in, the BP could focus more resources on those tunnels!  I have not heard of 10,000 invaders coming through a tunnel you asshat!
yes High level DEMOCRATIC,  will feel  the PAIN, only when their LOVE one are kill or rape....this is reality
yes Charlesetta Brown Illegal entry is criminal.They can go through legal channels!
no Sharon Et Trina Bratley so we should do nothing to prevent some, because we cant prevent all???????
yes thank you President Trump!
no Trump cant seem to get the funding for the wall with out....well running in to a wall. So here's an idea.  build military bases along the boarder and do training exercises. I would imagine if you fly fighter jets up and down the boarder you would be able to cover a lot of ground and radio in to boarder control locations of Invaders. And with foot troop on the ground doing exercises there would be plenty of man power to help round them up.
yes Thank you Mr President sir
yes Bullshit.
yes Absolutely.
no Kim Miller if you have to ask that question sorry to say , you are blinded by your ignorance
yes There were 323 mass killings in America in 2018.  Not a single one was committed by a person who had entered the country illegally.  You are being conned.
no Keith Webber Jr. of course since Obama never declared one to deny confess, you just proved you are a fucking idiot.    Why do you hate America?
no BULLSHIT
yes God Bless you Mr. President!!! Trump2020!!!
no Gods children
yes Frank Johnson, good luck with that, I dont waste energy on yall brainwashed Cult45 Worshippers 
yes Not to mention anyone whos done the research should know the wall is fiscally responsible
no Not new. Clinton did 17,Obama 13. Where were you
no I hope it doesnt happen to your family members:Libtards!
yes There were numerous serial killers and guess what? They r mostly white! So should they have gotten deported too?
yes Renee Korabiak Ah huh...let's not foget the multiple deliberate attempts on people Fauxtus considers enemies...ie deliberate actions taken to target and plan and physically obtain lethal items them deployed in attempts to kill them with malice aforethought, not some random guy trying to grab someone else's gun.
no Trump has never been wrong.
no I have been rear ended by an illegal immigrant twice, but fortunately my car was the only thing hurt. Of course they were not insured and I had to pay for repairs myself. Texas needs the wall and immigration enforcement.
yes Shami Khan so triggered you came to his page hahaha. How do you sleep at night being so pathetic?
yes Build The wall mr. President
yes Very well say
no Yes
no Jamie Bessette sorry for your loss tho thats intense
no Lisa P. Woodruff  Illegal aliens not immigrants
yes DID THIS ILLEGAL COME THROUGH A PORT OR THROUGH  THE DESERT? I want to know.
yes Australia loves  President Trump keep up the good work
yes Estefania Torres Restrepo not if we get enough ice agents to round them up and throw them the hell out of here
yes George Brakey They can't compete with what he's done in alittle over 2 years with jobs,Korea,taxes oil production lowest unemployment! All Dems can do is try to stop him from winning at his promise of border security  as a win for themselves!
no So sorry! Please accept my heart felt sorrow
no I'm do sorry for your loss
no Janie Rogers Doss the man was not born even present when his son was born.    Emergency
no A white American male killed 17 people at MSD last year. Guns are the real emergency
no With Trump, though, the only clear precedent being set is one of deplorable incompetence. Hes taking unpopular action that divides his party and unites the opposition, hes doing so with a combination of brazen hypocrisy and nonsense rhetoric that makes the power grab impossible to cloak, hes guaranteeing himself an extended legal battle  and he isnt even accomplishing any obvious goal (theres a reason real immigration restrictionists are against this plan) except the personal one of saving a tiny bit of face.
no Leon Rackauskas research it then
yes Dante Noel maybe you need to shut the hell up. Thanks Adam Trump 2020
yes The constant false alarm calls from all you Trumpanzees must be fucking hilarious!
yes Donna Davis No kidding!!! Gun violence in the US is the REAL emergency.
yes God Bless Our "ANGEL FAMILIES"-!!!
yes After the wall, WE START DRAINING THE SWAMP.
yes If it saves one life!
no KUS - KEEP US SAFE
no Apple Rivera people have lost loved ones from Americans also. If you wanna fix that problem you'd have to get rid of everyone, not just immigrants.
yes Bill Johnson more importantly he cares about golf!
yes Build the wall secure our borders
no https://youtu.be/ZDg7CUh53ys
no President Trump, you do what it takes to Build that Wall, You have over Billions of supporting you, and with Gods help we will get that Wall built, Trump 2020
yes I have no feelings for the deadly caravan plague
no Allyson Stuhlmiller Everyday I miss him, his face, his eyes he had the most amazing dark brown eyes. His voice telling me to calm down Dee. Only would he call.me mom when something serious happened. You are right half of me died the day he died and the other half wishes for him. He had his life planned out from the age of 6 years old.. he was like an old soul in a beautiful body. My heartbreak is sometimes too much....i miss his beautiful heart. He was very uniquely special...hes not here so every year that goes by is harder because I see his friends living out their lives and he is not here to do that. He was so full of love and life
yes You people need to believe the experts and not lying Trump.    A Border Wall isn't the answer. Most illegal immigrants overstayed their VISAS or entered through legal points of entry.
no So sad and sad for our country
yes An illegal immigrant knocked over a building and killed my brother.  Damn you Superman!!
yes Whats wrong with his head lol
no God Bless President Donald Trump. Best POTUS in 50 years. Hardest working too!
yes Meren Tinu I have worked with military from 80 different countries, there is no military on earth that does more to insure innocent people are not killed.
yes Agree  with you President Trump!!! Build that Wall!! God bless America and God bless Israel!
no It's alright when they wanted to do it an all agreed but it's just because Trump is not a life long politician they don't want him to do it an look like a hero after it stops all the drugs an massive crime from pouring into our country it's a fucking joke
yes Joseph Nowik not you again with your stupid ass s***. He didn't create this, where the hell have you been in the basement?
yes Yea well my dad was killed by one of them also. I was very young at the time.  My sisters brother and I suffered along with my poor mom. She was only 27.  Bulid that dam wall. And do something about all those kids they are having. Just to be able to stay here.  And have us support them.  While they stay home poping  kids out.
yes https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/i-didnt-need-to-do-this-donald-trump-declares-a-national-emergency
no Wendi Devalle i am sorry for your loss and i totally agree with you and don't listen to haters
yes Very sorry for your loss. Yes, building the wall will protect us all.
no Where is the blue check that this is President Trump?
no BUILD the WALL
no 100 US citizens are the victims of violent crime at the hands of illegals every day  If one of your loved ones was a victim, perhaps you would reconsider your position
no ;;
no okay and Americans kill too,  send your asses back to fucking england,  this was rightfully NATIVE AMERICANS land,  no one ever forced y'all to come here 
yes This is a tragic story but the fact remains that immigrants commit crimes at about half the rate of people born in this country. Trying to use a tragedy like this to score political points is tasteless and holding up this as a way to impugn all immigrants is disingenuous
no It's really great for you and your like-minded friends to identify yourselves as happy to see the US Constitution under attack.
yes "I didn't need to do this", is the very definition of not an emergency.
no finally! Thank you for caring!
yes God Bless you
no Ange Richmond ... No... The percentage of crime by immigrants is lower compared to percentage of Americans.
no Thank you President TRUMP!!
yes James Lewis Jackson Meanwhile as black me get gunned down by white cops.....crickets from SCROTUS!
no So now we are on to scare tactics when Americans kill each other more then we kill cows for food.
yes Ah Men     you are  Right  Mr  President
yes Chris Policronis what information specifically would you like
yes Margaret Charlton get your ignorance out of your ears. There are more factors than a simple statement to blame immigration status or lack there of. There is no actual evidence that this accident occurred because of immigration status. Peoples simple logic of well, if they where not here in the first place does not pass any body of proof tests. Theses are the facts. Someone was drinking. Someone drove a truck. Someone died. Saying this was caused from them being here illegally is not evidence. Its opinion. Saying if they where not here in the first place is conjecture. I have far beyond a GED.
yes what the Dem abortions
no I do agree with your idea though
yes If you don't like that wall just move to another country before it gets built....
no Actually, it isn't. They've repaired a little existing wall, but no new wall has been started. Do a little research. Also, spellcheck is a thing now.
no and we have laws against it and enforce them
yes Dedrick Jordan   Seek help.
no Build the wall , keep Americans safe .
yes Deanette Christopherson The Feds bring in the drugs... into the prisons.
yes Admittedly May is a nightmare but Europe is finished we are the first to leave but not the last
yes So sad.   Our President is absolutely right on this issue, as he has been on so many issues before.  Support Our President, and support our Border Wall to safeguard our Nation.
yes A walk MUST be built. Maybe some of the liberals that are against the wall should have one of their children or a family member killed/murdered by one of these illigal immigrants. Just maybe they would change their mind and be supportive in building this so needed wall.
yes Jean Kakuk ,trump wants to grab you by the pussy. Well,maybe not you
no Por pendejo tu hermano
yes To destroy USA you do not need a great military like USA. The greatest weapon to bring USA to her knees is the Democratic Party. Think about it Americans the Democratic Party are more concerned about the welfare of foreign nations & non-US citizens.
yes Just remember how el chapo manage to transport so many drugs around the world lol . He even built a tunnel . Wont stop lol not every criminal is illegal
yes Finish our Wall
yes Building the wall!
no Walls don't work. If they want to deal drugs or do harm their going to find a way to do it.  That's why their called criminals.
no Yes!!!
no Patty Bertocchini La Puma lying liar. You are 100% wrong. One officer was killed by an illegal immigrant. One. Im not defending it, but you are wrong. Fake news spreader.  https://www.google.com/amp/amp.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/dec/27/144-police-officers-died-in-line-of-duty-this-year/
yes So sorry!
yes Build the wall Mr President.  Then abolish the IRS , FBI and CIA. Next lock up all members of Congress and any other Politicians that break their constitutional oath to office . Reduce their salary to $25,000 a year , give them term limits and since they want our guns so bad , stop them from being allowed armed security . You have done a great job President Trump.  Now if we could just bring down the prices of everything in this price gouging , hyper inflated Society , so those of us that live below poverty level , could affird to live once again !!
no How many legal people kill people everyday. We have a murder problem not an immigration problem
yes Bill, Mr. trump is compromised and has proven himself to be an asset of The Russian Federation. Remember when Mr. trump advocated on behalf of Russia at The G7 in Canada? Why are we having a meeting without Russia being in the meeting? And I would recommend and its up to them, but Russia should be in the meeting and should be a part of it. former NBC celebrity game show host Mr. trump - 06/08/18 Why is this not a bigger story? That is not normal! Why not Brazil? Brazils economy is far larger than Russias. Russia is no longer a part of The G7 because it invaded its neighbor Ukraine in 2014! This is not a drill! This is serious stuff! Mr. trump is a national security risk. Im correct on this matter. 
yes Adam Corria well make the boarder control do theirs and stop bitching!!! Where is all this love for America? Their are kids getting poisoned! Lol the man keeps lying to you  dumb ass eating up
yes Paul Seldes and the Shooters was not Immigrants this was Trumpees the right Wing Idiots.
yes Yes,  President Trump, please, please build the wall. We stand with  you all the way. Also, thank you for fighting fir freedom of Christianity and what you are doing for  Israel.  I am praying for you and your family.  Keep up the  good things you are fighting for.
no Built the WALL
yes I'm british and my Visa expired. I dare someone to report me!
yes Florence Tedesco Pearl Brown Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR
no I just would like to have a hypothesis on what would happen if CNN had a bunch of illegals raped and murdered several of their reporters. Would they still be opposing President Trump and the wall? Could they even bring themselves to admit that President Trump is right?
yes Best president ever
yes Why not put the army at the bordee that money can be spend much better or wiser
yes How does  a wall  stop anyone? Reply trumpty dumpty followers ! Simple question!
no Our tax dollars are wasted anyway. Let's just take a chance and build the wall just maybe some people will use the front door and come legal or go to jail.
yes IN JESUS CHRIST NAME AMEN
yes Heartbreaking!
yes Yes build it now
yes If the wall saves one innocent life it is worth every penny
yes Very sad story. Nothing that relates specifically to immigration. Many native-born Americans drink and drive and flee accidents.
yes Walls work or else all the rich wouldnt have such high ones around their estates. Also lead works wonders too!
yes So sad this keeps happening to Angel Moms and Dads!
yes Yea but the left says the dont walk across border anymore. Apparently they take planes now.... smdh
no Unconscionable to use one person's tragedy for your own political gain. Even worse to give this man false hope. Because of Trump, this man will feel responsible for additional deaths caused by illegal aliens  when he learns more people will suffer loss like he did (when statistics demonstrate that the resources wasted on the wall could have saved countless others) if only America would have invested in alternative and far better protections than a wall. In addition, this poor Dad will be no closer to bringing his daughter back. Trump is literally compounding this man's tragedy for his political gain. GROTESQUE!
no Great leaders do not have to self-promote.  Great leaders do not have to use simple-minded propaganda spin messaging to falsely elevate themselves.  If one is a great leader, their words, actions and accomplishments speak for themselves.  Trump is one lousy, incompetent leader.
yes BUILD THAT WALL !!!
yes If the wall saves one American life Im for it. Lives Matter.
no Thank you Pres. Trump! God bless you.
yes youre an idiot
no Trump chuckled about how his "bone spurs" got him out of serving his country in Vietnam so he could play the dating game.  Macario Garcia was a boy of 3 when his parents moved their large family across the Rio Grande from Mexico to work in the fields of South Texas. Thats where the draft board found him, 19 years later, in 1942. Wounded in the Normandy invasion, Garcia recovered in time to rejoin the 22nd Infantry Regiment for its advance through the Hrtgen Forest  some of the most ferocious fighting of the war in Europe. On Nov. 27, 1944, acting squad leader Garcia led his men up a hill toward entrenched German positions. When the first machine guns opened up amid a rain of mortar fire, Garcia ignored severe wounds to his shoulder and ankle to drag himself toward the nest. When he destroyed that position, a second German gunner began firing. Once again, Garcia attacked, silencing the gun and taking four enemy prisoners. Even then, he refused to be carried from the battlefield until he knew the hill had been taken. At a White House ceremony in 1945, Staff Sgt. Garcia became the first Mexican-born soldier to receive the Medal of Honor. A month later, he was denied service at a segregated restaurant south of Houston, and when he refused to leave the premises, the owner beat him with a baseball bat. - WaPo
no Gabriel Anibal Toribio hell never learn
no Marcos Ramirez are Democrats taking money from the drug cartels politicians all see motivated by money over the best interest for Americans ,their position has no logic,with More than 70,200 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2017, including illicit drugs and prescription opioidsa 2-fold increase in a decade. ... Drug overdose deaths rose from 16,849 in 1999 to 70,237 in 2017. The bars are overlaid by lines showing the number of deaths by gender from 1999 to 2017 (Source: CDC WONDER).
no Shane Randle  so we will just ignore the fact that the immigrant is here illegally in the first place?  Build the damn wall.
yes The democrat communists lure the illegals and when they are here they find out it was all a lie,  they do what they know what to do best steal, attack , destroy and murder,  its not like they were highly educated and with endless job skills , they dont even know English
yes Ward Karsman Well, let's just do a fact check on ONE of your list...Robert Byrd was honored by the NAACP after his death, because of his tireless work for civil rights.  I understand English can be tough when its not your native language, so let me explain that NAACP is an acronym -it's made up of the first letters of the words in the title of an organization- meaning "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People".
yes So very sorry for the loss of your beautiful daughter. The blood of all these deaths is on Nancy and Ch ucks hand. Praying for your peace.
no https://www.facebook.com/100003370994761/posts/1928236563965358/
yes Its take long papa.
yes Shared
yes MAGA!
yes Eva Graham at least Pelosi has shown her Tax returns.
no Great British culture. I'm a Brit. The EU hate us. End of. So I'd rather we gave the USA 5 billion as a gift for the wall rather than give 39 billion a year to the EU ...
no When I wanted to escape prison it was a wall that stopped me
no So sorry for your loss. Let's pray that no more parents must suffer this horror.
yes https://youtu.be/YLVj1TCTQ3k
yes Im so sorry for your loss
yes Curtis Rice is the perfect example of why cousins shouldn't be allowed to breed with each other.
yes We need a Class Action Lawsuit to stop this invasion and forcing us to pay for it.
yes  I am so sorry for this man & his family! Praying for their healing  I WILL continue to pray for God to guide, direct , protect our President Mr Trump! 
yes whats a moeron?
yes Marxist Communist left sit on the left to destroy all socialist progress to overthrow capitalism. They never have a socialist agenda ever!!!! Karl Marx was Jewiish and a cousin to the Rothchilds bankers.
no Stephen Michael you make complete sense dood.
no Thank you President Trump  for doing your best to protect Americans.
yes Holy racists, batman.

no So sorry for your loss. I agree the wall must be built now
yes NO ONE but Pelosi can deny this!!!!!
no As much as I can sympathize at the loss of a daughter (mine passed away in 2013) I fail to see how one death out of over TEN THOUSAND deaths last year by drunk drivers, be they legally or illegally here is grounds to declare a national emergency, grounds to build a wall.It would be far better to declare a national emergency against all drunk driving.
no President Trump Is Building The Wall For The American Peoples Safety. Making America Great Again
no So sorry to hear of your loss it should of never happened your in my prayers may those so opposed to the wall open their eyes to what is really happening as a result of. Open wide borders our President is trying to protect us from things like this happening God bless you and your Family
yes Meanwhile: https://www-nytimes-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/us/ethan-couch-affluenza-jail.amp.html?amp_js_v=a2&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQCCAE%3D#referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2018%2F04%2F02%2Fus%2Fethan-couch-affluenza-jail.html
no If Anyone monitors this feed ....we have a family in LaGrange, GA that started an orphanage in Haiti...they are stuck there because they cannot get a Visa for the baby they adopted. The American Embassy is shut down. They are desperate! Does anyone have any connections to help bring them home?? I dont know how to share their story/post outside of my page...
no Keep the wall building
no Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin fake crisis is your opinion you got from media opinion. Truth is the voters, the president & Federal border agents disagree. What one would you choose, media bias or the source of people who are on the boarder, the president who has access to info no one else does, the voters who put someone in office to do a job that has gone unchecked for years?
no That I can agree on. I guess I misinterpreted your first post and I apologize for the misunderstanding.   Though we might not agree on everything, I respect your views and knowing you're a future politician, I'll give you this advice to help you on your path.  The ironic tone of your comment made it sound like you were making a statement on the president's priorities instead of him pushing propaganda. Some might have understood your position, but I think your comment is open to a lot of misinterpretations.  Nothing's wrong with irony or humor of course, though clearly stating your position is a must in this day and age (especially considering everyone takes everything as an attack nowadays). Hope this can be of some help for your future career. :3
yes I am not American but I had always been your fan for the fine person you are. I think people must trust in your decisions. The government has to protect its people and the president must do whatever is in his reach to help with that. I would be proud to have you as my president. God bless you and your people.
no Ron O'Hearn we enforce immigration laws every day too so what's your point?
yes Border emergency what a hoax
no Build the Wall
yes Americans kill Americans all the time. Hell I bet the damn police kill more innocent people than any so called undocumented immigrants
yes I like that
yes Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin opinion vs fact..2.) Jobs  ~ 4 million new jobs have been created since the election, and more than 3.5 million since Trump took office.  ~More Americans are employed now than ever before in our history. Jobless claims at lowest level in nearly five decades.  ~The economy has achieved the longest positive job-growth streak on record. Job openings are at an all-time high and outnumber job seekers for the first time on record.  ~Unemployment claims at 50 year low African-American, Hispanic, and Asian-American unemployment rates have all recently reached record lows.  ~African-American unemployment hit a record low of 5.9 percent in May 2018.

Nearly two-thirds of Americans rate now as a good time to find a quality job. Optimism about the availability of good jobs has grown by 25 percent.  ~Added more than 400,000 manufacturing jobs since the election.  ~Manufacturing employment is growing at its fastest pace in more than two decades. 100,000 new jobs supporting the production & transport of oil & natural gas.
no I am so sorry for your loss. I stand with our president. Love and Prayers
no El Chapo's people dig underneath walls
yes No, Don. They will not keep us safe, but they will contribute to our safety.
no Make this go viral: https://www.facebook.com/dave.reiser.9/videos/10213329614251019/?t=19
yes Diane Smith DONT COUNT ON IT!
no Emily Neal I'm so sick of liberal stupidity.  Crime is a state issue.  This is a federal issue since it has to do with illegal immigration.   Stop voting Democrat, and your state will fair better.  Also, go back to school and educate yourself on state and federal issues.  You must have skipped government classes.
no If it can save even one life we should build the wall, right libs?
no Do best for  every one, people country & world, once we to gether we do every thing for safe life. safety is must in our  life than money. Wall we build later , but criminal mafia is inside the countryu between people.  capture them first , take technology from them because thy use every technology in my home ,in our body. Thy r behind my family ,  want divide, divorce, ruin , I never seen them I don't want to see them, they ruin any life when they want, either president ,  Pm , businessman, or any people, They R mouth speaker , Capture any camera delete image , Disappear criminal mafia, Hack track & push mind for any one ,  They have no right to look any one's personal life, , Be strong sir , God Bless you & nyour Family.
yes need a wall.
no Certain people do not believe that a southern border wall will make any difference but just wait until it hits home and someone they love lose their life because of lack of that border wall you better believe it
no There's a serious problem at our Southern borders.
yes Charles Michael Spooner II Yes! And they will.
no Build the WALL. BUILD the WALL.  Keep us and the country safe please. God's your guie and protector.
yes We can t blame the vulgar or bad feelings of the most people for our deceptions.....they are what they can .....but we must live and fight for God Amrica and all people deserves to live with moral respeat and true love in GOD for Amrica!!!!!!
yes Dianna Adams Ewen - If you are referring to the "new trade agreement with Mexico" that has never been ratified by Congress and therefore has never taken effect, no it does not make any provision for Mexico funding any phony walls, directly or indirectly.  And no I never thought Mexico was going to write a check.  I am not as stupid as your "president"  who said precisely that, or his voters who were stupid enough to believe him when he said it and believe him again when he claimed he never said it.
yes Danny Hernandez
yes This man took an oath too protect us Americans and hes trying too do this.Its not his job to fix all of the  Americans problems of health and finances,take responsibility people we are not entitled.
no Stops the dividing of families. They can not throw their children over the fence and say America separated them
yes Sorry for all your losses and yes 100 % with the idea of the wall !!!! R.I.P to all who were killed by evil
yes God Bless America and our President.
yes So should we just build a wall around the whole country so no one can get in or out? The south border is not the only border. Also, how many criminals from America have traveled across the southern border to live there illegally? It goes both ways. 911 happened because of a man across seas, complete opposite direction. Should I also mention that this land was taken from Indians, not given to our ancestors? There is so much to this that no one is considering because Trump's phony speeches and false promises are trapping you guys into this crap. Our country has been built on white, biblical, supremecy, and anyone who doesn't go by the book or anyone who belongs to a culture they don't like, they are trying to keep them out.
yes Dan Griffin   Neither do I!!!  It's facts versus feelings!!!!
no i feel bad for you...no one should ever be treated that way.
yes Alberto Weisz Im no fool. I know a door gates and fences do nothing to keep anyone out of my house.
yes Dave Heffner its already illegal to cross the border
yes fake news better than no news
no How come you dont advocate for victims of mass shootings using the same rationale?
no #AGREE!   Walls work, so complete the wall!  God bless!
yes Hal Eric Mitlitsky  hes been trying to get out of this job since he was elected.
no Sharon Et Trina Bratley at least they problem had a license and insurance also wont be driving
yes Nancy and Chuckie are you two listening?
yes Build the wall and drain the social democratic swamp. President Trump send those liberal NWO GLOBALIST communist traitors to Siberia WHERE THEY BELONG.
yes Thank you Sir
no Trump is trying his bestv
no Ralph Alvord Hey
yes Ughhhhhhh
yes You gave up too much in this deal! Immigration will be increased and we will suffer the consequences more!
no Michael Thompson https://www.facebook.com/roguepressbriefs/photos/a.219075375254770/550355752126729/?type=3&theater
no Also, left coast, land of fruits and nuts
no help, Make our world a better place.  please, Mr President
no 772019702
no Hal Eric Mitlitsky every single president has declared a national emergency, usually to protect foreign countries, time to protect ours.
yes Dylan Clymore yes! 4 walls to be exact, but one wall might be made with vertical steel bars.
no we will to, ,
yes You  can  blame  governor  Newsome  and  polos  of it
no Gus Keller You should move California or better yet to San Francisco with the other snowflakes like yourself .
yes Will the wall keep everyone save from the Americans that are killing people an robbing houses an drugs I dont see how the Mexicans get the blame for everything Americans do wrong
no I thought for sure this story would be about those big ass fore-heads. Lol
no My president
yes Another mass shooting and not even a word from the "Mar a Lago" national emergency crisis con.
yes James Campbell how many die because of a car ?why arent you screaming about banning cars .more gun laws isnt going to stop it .
yes 2020 Trump & BEYOND. Enough with all the illegal invaders build the wall and send all them back......
yes John N Karen Morris it's hard to be funny with ignorant bigots like you
no You want to blame immigrants   Rally me this  what if trumps grandfather  were the immigrant who killed his daughter   Is that the solution for an unnecessary wall  We have more shootings of backyard corn bread  Americans killing more than any other race in the United States    The statistics are proof  You cant blame one immigrant When last year alone you have 50-1  50-Americans  1- immigrant  Responsible for the murders of innocent people   We have a Gun problem  Not an immigrant issue
yes Hey pussy-grab, remember that time you told us Mexico was going to pay for the wall?  Was that "fake news"?
no Ok . ask pelosi and the lottery man what they think coz they dont care! They care more about looking after the illegals
no Jim Acosta and Nancy Pelosi try to ignore this. The American people hear it loud and clear.
no Alberto Weisz so why are there still doors at your place then? You still carry a set a keys to get in too???
no Channel 3 here in Phoenix interviewed a Dad who lost his son to a multiple DUI offender, illegal alien. His son was hit and run, after initially hitting him the man in fleeing ran over him, killing him, he supports the wall 100%
yes Theyll tunnel under it mate. Waste of time.
yes President Trump, respectfully I implore you to quit taking all this gruff from the democrats and their far left wing. Please release the documents that you promised to unseal. You need to expose the lawless left and if so those on the right! If you actually see these messages help America help you make it great again, expose Washington for who they are!
no Not likely soon
no Sorry for your loss Sir, such a waste of life, that would never have happened if not for the laws or lack of enforcement, and the so called leaders from the lowest city mayors, to the gov"s, congressmen, and senators lack of caring, or maybe they getting kickbacks of one sort of another from making sure the flow of people, drugs, and sickness never stop !!!!
yes We must build the wall not only for todays citizens but for future generations..Thank you President Trump for striving to get the USA back to a nation of integrity...Thank you and God bless
no omg thats so funny it just cracks me up; haven't laughed this hard since i watched the fake pres make a fool of himself in front of the WH yesterday.
no I'd call millions of illegals here over the years a fucking crisis.wouldnt you.
yes Keith Webber Jr. You get Lego Stones Troll. Than you can bulit when you finished with work  Wall , das and Night  Low Minded naive Brain Limited Trumpee
no In fairness to all the Angel moms & dads whose children were killed by illegals who came into the country illegally, we the citizens demand that the wall must be finish.
yes How many sons and daughters has trump killed
yes Marcos Ramirez I guess his accomplishments mean nothing, its cool just wake up with hate in your heart and MSN in your ears
no Albert Lucas sorry I meant billion it auto corrected.
yes Ive been following the whole Build the Wall debate the best I can & I would like to voice my opinion. Why on earth would American citizens NOT want to protect their country?? I cant figure that out. People need to set aside their feelings about President Trump & Congress & strip the debate down to what the issue is. This is keeping America safe, plain & simple. I really dont care if its a wall, border agents, cameras, whatever.  Put the bickering aside & just DO SOMETHING! We protect our homes, our possessions; why not our country? This is where we LIVE people! Such stupidity all this whining & name-calling. What good does that do? Put that energy towards something positive.
no I want the wall built but i do not want my president to look stupid . He is after all the PRESIDENT OF the UNITED STATES OF America
yes Our president would be impeached if he didnt something wrong. You people need to just go with the flow until hes impeached or done
yes How many more must die til we get a wall??
yes Stupid
no Tim Koepp , nothing will change until it happens to a politicians family.
no Very sorry for your daughter being a victim, sir, this is beyond serious, Kate Steinle should have been enough for Naughty Nancy to flip and convince Chuckie we need border wall, and over-all extensive immigration reform!
yes This guys opinion doesnt matter , the only opinion that matters the the radical liberal politicians who want open borders and anchor babys to boost their voter rolls
no Time to create a Border Chief Engineer.  Where are the Engineers in politics???? Be the first President to embrace engineers.  Engineers create our economy, but are consistently ignored as the experts they are.    Time to appoint a Chief, let him answer the Wall updates.   Time for the President to move onto the next project.  If you need anyone to argue the reason to build it, just make a Wall website, with a politician section with all the Democrats saying a Wall is necessary.    In 2020 we don't want to argue the Wall like an Abortion arguement of past elections, we the voters want to say, "The Wall was built, crime, drugs, have gone down in the past year".  We cannot say that if the Wall is not built.
no This is sad but shouldn't be America's main focus there was ANOTHER mass shooting yesterday done by an American! Many people killed many hurt!
no Trump is a liar because he says the the Mexicans are going too pay for the border wall but he is coming too the democrats for he is a liar impeach him send him back too his reality tv show called apprentice
no So South Asia has also to right to build the wall to stop your government way towards more warfare.
yes Danny Jones I'll happily second that!!!!
no Yvail Fox that would be
yes https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.elpasotimes.com/amp/2117269002
no So sorry
yes Danny Jones, I am sorry that the European Union is taking 39 billion dollars a year from your nation every year. Completely unsustainable.   Praying that Brexit is finalized this year.
yes Lisa Mannim retired from the Michigan department of corrections,  if done right ,the wall /fences ,would stop about 99% .I was in Israel before the wall was built, they had weekly bus bombings, after wall built bus bombings stopped,  then they built a wall ,along Egyptian border, where thousands were entering illegally, know there was only 16 people get across, wall work if built right, and manned right. Thank you.
yes Thank you Mr President
no Go Trump you The Man!!
no How many people have been murdered by Illegal immigrants VERSUS How many people have been murdered by white Americans lets say in the last 10 years?
yes Danny Jones what culture is that then ?
no bs...do you even know what the term means...3-4 victims ...thats  what...take a look at percentages...there are 14 times  the amount of citizens to latinos....350 million to 20 million.....math alone tels you theres going to be more citizens killing ...gangs kill that many on any given weekend.....mass shootings lol...get educated
no We are meeting some real resistance from local,state and national elected officials that are obviously on the game from cartels! It seems draining the swamp has gotten more complicated! No wonder Trump made the comment that he hoped it wasn't too late to save America!
no That is a big problem in San Diego
no There are many better ideas. A wall won't stop the tunnels nor will it stop the fentanyl thats flying in fromChina.
yes So sorry for your loss there is no excuse for not stopping these horrible acts.
yes That's is truly terrible what happened to you, both. But I would argue a wall doesn't fix these things as accidents happen from more than just illegal immigrants. Universal healthcare would certainly have helped with those medical bills though.  Apple - if CHP knew he came through Texas, then he couldn't have crossed illegally. If it was an illegal crossing then they couldn't know that, think about it. That really does suck, what happened to you, but clearly a wall wouldn't have prevented this from happening to you.
no I think we are very naive if we  think this wall will stopp immigrants ! Use this money instead to help people in US that need help !
no Here in Germany we can only dream of closed boarders - keep on realizing your plans
no Build the wall President Donald J. Trump. The polls AREN'T correct!! You have a LOT MORE support than they say...they just don't poll everyone!! WE WANT THE WALL!! WE NEED THE WALL!! WE DESERVE THE WALL!!
no it happen everywhere in the world.
yes Just build the wall !!!
no Mr. President, please stop using people like this as pawns in your ill-fated game of chess. Her suffering is unconscionable and the culprit should be held to account, but it doesnt justify your actions. The research shows this just isnt where the focus should be right now. An unjustified executive power grab like you took this week, which you denounced under Obama, only steepens the fact that this scare mongering is atrocious, unethical, and dangerous.
no I agree
yes Trump made some very specific promises during his campaign and I voted for him because of those promises. I want three things before I vote for Trump in 2020. 1). I want Hillary/The Clinton Foundation prosecuted. 2). I want progress on the Wall. Funding and the wall being started. 3). I want Obama Care repealed. No, I didn't say fixed or a work around or even kind of repealed. I want it Repealed. And NO(!) repealing the "mandate" is NOT the same thing as a repeal. And no, he didn't promise to FIX Obamacare. Donald Trump was clear, he promised to repeal the most oppressive legislation ever imposed on the American people. These points are nonnegotiable; period.
no I support America also like trump does, trump 2020
yes Repost Nancy's number 202-225-4965 build the wall. Here's Chuck's 202-224-6542. Be professional but demand the wall funds.  Repost numbers. Let's do this
no Please stop using these people.
yes Sorry for your loss.
no Never heard or read story about that... most of it is the illegals
no Donald J. Trump, put the border wall to a national vote. Let the people decide. I believe we need it, and I am with you. Lets see if the people of America do as well.
yes That's What sanctuary cities are all about
no Yes we need a wall erected as soon as possible !!
no Build the wall dont let the lefties win. Ignore the protest majority wants the wall. You made that a campaign promise and you always keep your campaign promises. You are tough and cant be bullied . Build that wall president Trump!
no Democrat socialists call the invasion of criminals " manufactured". Pelosi said Trump is delusional,there's no crisis. When they're,along with Soros & his buddy are org & paying these caravans of enemies? They are committing treason against Americans while trying to disarm citizens, not criminals. Hitlers.
yes Drugs are a choice that unfortunately many teens make...Innocent teens getting shot and killed in school is not a choice......Where is the national emergency?
no Im so sorry to hear that. I do believe in our President Trump
yes You know if walls are important to you, you should have gotten one when the Republicans had Congress.
yes Completely agree, Charlesetta.
yes There is no difference between an illegal alien & a Democrat.  Their "kill record" is sickening!
no Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall!!
no Yves Graux
yes Danny Jones what is your culture not trying to be rude
yes John N Karen Morris yes that is something a fascist cunt would do.  We know how to deal with fascism here.    To report a president that is a Russian asset, support Mueller.
yes Outstanding leadership President Trump!
no RIGHT MR PRESIDENT
no Bill Johnson are you serious
yes Real talk
yes Tim Somolitis, the Republicans are divided about the need but either way, a person who listens to a proven compulsive liar who can neither negotiate or make a deal and wasted 6 billion dollars of taxpayer money shutting the Gov down over money for a Wall that he said Mexico said they would pay for, is in no position to suggest who others should  listen to   Bottomline, it's clear that the politicians will deal with this in court.  The first of many lawsuits have already been filed about what they call a " Manufactured Crisis" in order to bypass Congress
yes https://www.statista.com/statistics/476456/mass-shootings-in-the-us-by-shooter-s-race/        Overwhelmingly, the mass shooters in our country are white. But the narrative out of the Oval is not that. Wonder why.
yes Remove democrats for obstructing
yes I am sad that innocent people have lost there lives, and a group of people, Liberal Democrats, who have supported the wall before, refuse to do the right thing just to Hurt Trump.  Well guess what Americans are being robbed (ME), murdered, drugs crossing borders,  trafficking of women and children.  DemocRATS your not hurting Trump your Hurting US citizens. GET A CLUE!
no https://www.facebook.com/450243058344758/posts/2140768489292198/
yes Dan Burnzinsky Thought them over it! Mind bullets!
yes Foreheads.
no John Zappini, your argument is complete BS. A border wall will not stop the flow of drugs into the US.
no I would become Pelosi's nightmare for the rest of her life if that was my daughter ......
no Angela K Christensen I cannot claim to have lost a loved one due to an illegal immigrant. However, I pay my fair share of taxes, they dont. I pay for my medical usage, they dont.  I pay for a lot of the things given to them freely. Im not against people coming to the USA. Im all for them coming to our wonderful country. However, I want them to do so legally and become citizens. Thats all.
yes Steven Keslar just like we sued obummer? Not going to work
no 5 people were killed the other by a gunman. The Las Vegas massacre was a national emergency. 100s of people were killed. When is the real emergency going to be addressed ?
yes Danny Jones Thank you for caring.  God bless.
yes Amen to you and your family we send our prayers
no BUILD THE WALL AN SIR please stop telling the left what the right is up too gives them to much ammunition or prep time to make your life an ours miserable.... I SUPPORT YOU AN THE WALL... AS DO VERY MANY AMERICANS... WE STAND BEHIND OUR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP....have a wonderful Presidents day tomorrow.... an HOW DARE CNN AN OTHER NEWSPAPER PEOPLE TRY TO MCOK OUR PRESIDENT.....clinton obama supporters...when obama had a 12 different times emergencies for stupid things he just did it an no one even knew.... YOU SIR ARE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BUILD THE WALL....an you sir are our president for the next 6 years...
no Krista Meyer they do put out warnings, at least in Ohio.  I post many of them in my crime group.
yes Gun reform https://www.vox.com/2019/2/16/18227655/aurora-shooter-gun-domestic-violence
yes Preach All You Want Buddie , Becaus The Democrat Politicians Dont Care One  Bit, There To Worried About Destroying America.
yes The CR bill you signed that was full of pork, amnesty, and restrictions on ICE will do the opposite of help Americans. #offthetrain
yes on behalf of idiots everywhere, let me say how insulting!
yes Should have never happened  opposers can say what they want ...but the facts remain- if this illegal wasnt here she would still be alive! How we spend billions on taxpayer funded abortions but cant find 5 to build a wall infuriates me!
yes What a shame to lose a beautiful daughter
yes Yes, please don't let us ever forget those who have suffered because of our open borders. It is time to get our borders closed so we can be safe and check everyone coming into our homeland.
no Crime rates are higher for Americans than for immigrants. Fix gun control.
no Gabriel Anibal Toribio another one, heres to the 1% Kerlyn Marcelino....
yes Another sad example of why our country needs secure borders.
no What about all the whites killing Americans here, every mass shouting theres has been has been by an America. White Donald
yes I propose building a wall in memory of those lost over the past 3 decades due to lack of and ineffective border security. Think of all those lost since 1990 due to terrorist attacks along with all of those killed by illegal criminal aliens. The wall could be similar to that of the Vietnam Veterans Wall and it could travel throughout all 50 states making people aware of the lives lost giving us the opportunity to pay homage to them. Thank you for all you do Mr. President. We are praying for you in all your decisions and endeavors.
yes Nothing more American than mass shootings!
yes Joseph Nowik all presidents have called national emergencies.  I cant wait until people know what they are talking about before spouting off.
yes Mike Mandel well guess what. That is exactly what is proposed.
no Gabriel Bergeron, compare a job in a steel factory with a job? Are you on drugs?   https://www.facebook.com/TheOther98/photos/a.115969958413991/2503185179692445/?type=3&theater
no What about them? It has nothing to do with the fact that we can act in a responsible way, and slow down the illegals. No one ever said this would stop homegrown evil. The point is to stop or reduce  what we can control.
yes Bryan Hurlburt Himself, himself and himself.
yes Totally empty words
yes Illegal immigrants killed millions of Native Americans.
yes What happened to E-verify? That is the one issue that would fix most of the problems.  I want a wall, just wondering about why E-verify isn't made mandatory for employers....
yes A legal citizen killed my nephew with a gun. We must get rid of all guns! Right?
no COLLUSION!  - Trump Advisor, Stone Communicated w/ Russian GRU Hackers & Wikileaks about release of DNC emails  - Trump Campaign Manager, provided polling data to Russian Agent  - Don Jr./Kushner/Manafort met Russian Agent to get Hillary Dirt  - Russia promised Trump Tower Moscow
yes Thank you Mr President Donald Trump for working so hard for America and giving us the best,  you only want whats good for us , because these is your country even doe you could live anywhere in the world you choose America,  because you are a greatful son , unlike the democrat communists that want to destroy America to make themselves rich
no By the way, Presidents Day, Monday Feb.18th, is canceled until we get one.
no People who don't want the wall are for criminals -aka. Democrats. We elected President Trump to fight criminals and we want him to . #BUILDTHEWALL
yes Austin Reis Green Did you read some of these comments? Horrible how some have suffered because of this insanity.
yes Fox news  Fake news
yes Why don't we hear about these on news  They're to busy Harrasing our President
yes I'm shocked USA today wrote this. In the era where media is ignoring and dismissing angel families this is a shocker
no That is so very sad also.  But that isn't what this message stream is about.  You should start a new post on that one.    Surely you would get support for it.
yes Thank you for declaring an emergency.
no Jackie Lee Collins American prisons are filled with Americans.  And?  You think because we have criminals here we should invite more criminals to come here?     Were you born this stupid or did you have to work at it?
yes So sorry for your loss. Praying.
yes Simone Piloni
no Linda Durbin How many people have been murdered by Illegal immigrants VERSUS How many people have been murdered by white Americans lets say in the last 10 years?
yes Not a bad thought.  It should be part of a discussion of best ways to address any problem.
no Yes sir thank you President Trump!
yes Eva Graham , after we impeach Drumpf for treason!
yes Tyler Loving that is BS propaganda you are trying to spread
no All for the National Emergency but the National Security bill needs VETOd if it makes it that far. Dont give in. It sucks!
yes My question is, What real harm will a wall or fence do?
no Lynn Limauro Floyd   Your son was a moron
yes Kris Landers sorry the wall will prevent further loss of funds why do they want to come here Free healthcare , jobs schools oh and dont forget birth right citizenship are all opportunity that should be for green card holders and sponsored workers etc .
yes Build  the  wall .
yes The name Donald Pinocchio is very beautiful. Your priority is Israel's security !! Do not lie to the American people.
no Stop
yes Guns kills more people than illegals.  Doi.
yes Danny Jones you need to go educate yourself, and have all the facts checked! Please!
yes Barbara Samuel well I just sent you the pictures you say Im lying about. Ive no reason to lie about an accident, only to bring awareness. In case youd like to put your foot in your mouth, I can send you my hospital bills, and the CHP report.
yes This is a very sad story.  Too bad it has nothing to do with a stupid wall.
yes Thank you Mr President You truly are a Godsend to America and the free world! God bless you
no DUMOCRATS KNOW WALLS MAKE US SAFE SO THEY DON'T WANT THEM  BUT THEY HAVE THEM AROUND THEIR HOUSE  RIGHT PELOSI
yes the democrats are against him , the republicans are weak, we the people put him there and its up to us to keep him there keep up the good work mr  President
no Albert J Destefanis it's to bad people can't see trump for what he is, a lying egomaniacal psychopath!!
yes Benedict Bchele we live in a free country, people can say what they want.
yes Guess he learned from the Democrats on how to exploit situations.   Democrats are professional victims !
no Kris Landers How hard for you is this to understand ??? If the person was never in the country, he wouldn't have been here to cause the accident. -- Get that GED, you need it .
yes I wish NANCY & CHUCK WOULD LISTEN TO THIS TRAGIC NEWS AND BUILD THE WALL!!
no Bullshit! If protection for American families was Dumpster's highest priority he'd be having high level meetings to look for solutions to our national gun fatalities emergency.
no The left relates to a wall like a marriage therapist talks about a psychological defense mechanism a wall is an inanimate object design to protect life and property! What the heck is wrong with the left they do not know the difference between legal and illegal and now they're talking about a physical wall like an emotional problem God help us.
no We need a good purge.
yes And a few trump supporters killed kids in mass shootings. Right wing extremists groups are our number one threat right now. Stop the dog whistles and get your people in line. Day after day we keep hearing about your people harassing, hurting and killing people. DO SOMETHING
yes So if a legal citizen kills a person, it's okay, right?
no Sad that so many have lost their lives. I pray that all illegals are removed before any more of our children are murdered & addicts get help before they are killed by these drugs flowing into our country. God Bless President Trump for taking the necessary steps when our traitor congress would not.
no Last year there were 40,000 firearm related deaths on the US. Last year the Trump administration overturned environmental protection statutes and workplace safety regulations. Meanwhile, people without legal resident status actually have one of the lowest crime rates in the country- precisely because they dont want to risk being deported. If Trump truly wanted to make American families safe he would implement stricter gun laws, reinstate laws that ensure clean water and safe food, and protect workers from dangerous working conditions. But we all know he couldnt care less about actually making American families safe. #AmericaDeservesBetter
no How's your golf game going? Bone spurs not acting up?
no Wendi DelValle so sorry about your brother
yes Curtis Rice gee Curtis.  Maybe that's because there are more of us...
yes Michael Thompson You've never been to a US where every single gun was banned and the ban was enforced.
no So sorry that happened!  Prayers for you and your family, yes President Trump built the wall!
yes Lets start taking names of RINOs and get rid of them
no We are. Let them try and sue him. Eyes dont lie.  Honestly, he should have just called for a national emergency from the get go, but I understand him wanting to try going through congress first. This country is not holding thousands of illegal kids because we dont have a border crisis. Think about that. Why do we have so many illegal children in custody? We have a problem people. It's not that hard to see.
yes So sorry for the loss of  your precious child.
yes What about melina trump she is also immigrant
yes Who are the 116 sick F***CS  that thinks this is funny?
yes Sue Howie what does one thing have to do with another? We can do better about making sure our gun laws are followed and at the same time build the wall make sure our immigration laws are followed.
yes Lisa Mann and do you not think that the wall would surround the homeland? Hello.
yes losing life is greatest thing we could not accept this !!
no Build The Wall.!!!!
yes EVEN IF IT MEANS THE DEMS WON'T GET THEIR PACK OF MONEY FROM THE SOUTH.
yes Fool. Build the wall. DJT 2020

yes Debbie Valdovinos you are ignorant or a liar, which?
no Is it possible dems are getting kickbacks from drug cartels?
no No life is worth 5 billion dollars says every Democrat everywhere
yes Just do it do it do it.... Nobody loves crimes and criminals
no Bull O'Neill You obviously are repeating crap that you have heard and I gather do not spend much time reading and learning about the rescession..Maybe this will help you a bit .you will be hoping for another President like Obama by the time Trump is out of office because his spending is on steroids.....I am sure you won't believe me  but easily researched.....but you won't like the facts you will find out. He has never been fiscally good with his own companies that is why he has filed bankruptcy so often.     https://www.therichest.com/rich-list/the-biggest/the-top-10-biggest-spending-presidents/      https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/07/trump-budget-deficits-growing-big-spending-fiscal-irresponsibility/           and he isn't doing well in the way of trade deficits either despite his bragging...     https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/08/03/trump-hates-trade-deficit-its-track-be-biggest-decade/?utm_term=.7f7f6ef1fee9\
yes I'm sure when wealthy Americans built barriers around their homes, they weren't directing thoughts of illegal immigrants or cartels breaking in there homes.  I'm pretty sure they were thinking bout Americans meth heads instead
yes Sir Donald Trump is God sent. Americans don't value what they have, unlike us in Nigeria who don't have any president.
yes MAY GOD COMFORT HIS FAMILY.
no #BUILDTHEWALL.
no Yes, ASAP
no The world has 0 respects for the people of the USA,  our government likes to play the good guy, so keep working. Your money is working.
yes Would LOVE to see the statistics of how many people died from mass shootings versus being murdered by illegal immigrants.
no Noble Loria so according to your logic, the live Facebook streams of the past week or so, at the border where the area is going from wide open area to an area that has a wall is fake?  Ohhhhhhkay.
no Do you mean walls like most of the ones that are against it has around their homes?  Umm makes since to me !
yes Michelle Ann Deshaw Pearl Brown Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR
yes We stand with our President!
no This type of divisive claptrap is exactly what the Australian government has been feeding us for the past 10+years and we are finally waking up to it. Keep the public ignorant and xenophobic because that makes us easier to control. Just do a little bit of research and, like Australia, you will find that most undocumented immigrants arrive legally on tourist visas and simply don't go home. No border wall is gonna stop that.
yes Jamie Bennett I agree! What does he care about?
no Good morning sir
no David Simmons
no https://youtu.be/W1XDwADwfBw
yes Ok fucktard because ONLY illegal immigrants kill?!? What about all these Americans Killing Babies!!!
yes I am so sorry that Pelosi , Shumer and their Congress hate you so much and do not care, they hate me too and my family nearly died from drunk driving illegals a few years ago, I cannot believe how our country had turned its back on us . Thank God for Trump!! I thank God everyday for Trump, he loves his country and the people.
no #BUILDTHEWALLNOW
no July 16, 2018: I was rear ended by an illegal, Daniel Zuniga who was driving an Enterprise moving truck, injured my back, neck, and shoulder. Enterprise didnt take responsibility because they said they didnt contract with him. Daniel Zuniga is no longer able to be found. Find all underground tunnels coming into the US.  #BUILDtheWALL President Trump 
no Danny Jones thank you but since you can give us your Prayers!!  They are better than money!
yes Thank you Mr Trump...Illegal Immigration costs us way more each year than building the wall.  Prior presidents have wanted to do this but never got it done.  Well sorry people, like him or not President Trump has been working for me, and you, and finally putting America first since he took office.  The economy is good, unemployed the lowest its even been, the military is getting stronger, and Trump is working to get all of the unfair deals and so on that the US has been getting screwed over on.  Yes there is alot of other things that need attention..prescription prices...veterans..elderly...homeless people, revamping the welfare system...but I think Trump has done a good job so far and glad he doesn't mind ruffling some feathers doing what he has to do to get things done..
no MAGA, Built the wall,  dont let these crazy Democrat politician stop u. God bless you, you have turn around lots of Democrats to support you and I'm one of them, just keep doing what u are doing
no Wow tump you use other peoples sorrows to advance the far rights agenda that you have no clue about . What about when my uncle worked on your casino and you flied for bankruptcy just so you did not have to pay him , poor guy also went bankrupt when he was left with a $750,000 debt
yes Illegals don't belong here! We welcome immigrants coming legally! If they are coming illegally, they must be hiding something! BUILD THE WALL!
yes Build the wall and in same time sand all illegal immigrants back where they come from. You will see difference in over economy. Unemployment O, school classrooms half full, jails half empty, court rooms need to be open two days a week. Waiting to go see Dr half as long. Over economy booming because government and States have surplus money. Crime cut 90% this is just small picture what is illegals immigrants doing to America and American Citizens.
no Jennifer Yvonne Croff you are right, but i could also blame alcohol: if there wouldnt be alcohol she would be alive. Should alcohol be banned?
no Me too, loss my son almost 8 years ago.....
yes We must have the wall!!!
yes Prayers for you and your families.

yes So sorry for your Tragic loss. My prayers are with you.
yes HAVE A STROKE AND DIE TODAY MOTHER FUCKER
no Tear down the doors of any politicuan who is against the wall, year down THEIIR fences, throw away THEIRr keys to their cars, pitch tents in THEIR backyards and invite any illegal to squat there and see how THAT suits them...and by the way, take THEIR guns and tie the hands of the police that  protect them, then see what kind of tune THEY sing then!
no Brittney Braley because trump is trynna make mexico pay for it , sis . 
yes President Trump:  Thank you for standing up and doing what's right for our country.  Never give up!  :-)
yes Yes build the wall,
no Still think he's making this up?
yes https://www.facebook.com/NowThisPolitics/videos/346213832769560/
yes Laurel Balinski, there is nothing   illegal about them  if they haven't entered the United States!  Can't refer to them as illegal immigrants.   It's your comment that's wrong!  Why is YOUR FB PAGE FAKE?
no Ask Putin he knows about walls
yes PRESIDENT TRUMP 2020
no Thank you Mr. President for not giving up. God bless you.
no Lynn Limauro Floyd How many people have been murdered by Illegal immigrants VERSUS How many people have been murdered by white Americans lets say in the last 10 years?
yes the morons dont understand how tariffs work and the " new " NAFTA has not even been signed
yes Ride Mr President. You have true love for America. God bless President D. Trump.
yes I trust you read my comments on how to end this thing.
yes Yes the sooner the better.
no You are disgusting because her life means nothing to you. She and all the others who will be killed by someone who has NO right to be here are the reason we need a wall!! You actually have a higher chance of being affected by an illegal as you are part of the Latino community.
no Keith Webber Jr. not too bright are you???.....sad
yes And yet, he hasnt done anything for the Americans who continue to be shot and killed by other Americans at an alarming rate. What a joke. This crime is not indicative of immigrants.
yes President Trump,  Please enforce border walls and security to enforce our southern border NOW!
no BUILD THE WALL!!!!
yes Emil Drr
yes Marybeth Paredes so dont fix one because there are multiple?
yes We need the wall but we need to staff our wall with our military men and woman. If they attempt to cross our boarder we have every right to eliminate that illegal immigrant to extent of power we need to use up to and including death
no Mass shootings kill hundreds in America, when do we institute meaningful gun reform.
no WE LOVE YOU POTUS  !!!!! MAGA !!!!!!!!!!
yes An illegal immigrant killed my Uncle. Had been deported twice.
no Jo Sechi We must have a Wall  and we Must Stop illegal immigrants from killing    Us ..
yes We need to stop talking about being safe from other humans and bring attention to be safe from the New World Order....There is an peace deal on the table that if America and Israel sign..it will start the Tribulation...Our only real enemy is Satan...
no Trump 2020
yes It's not about a wall! It's all about the voting booth! We have a RIGHT to have voter I'D!  Now let's talk collusion & meddling in an election!  TRUMP MAGA 2020++++++++
yes Bill Johnson yeap very safe , shootings eveywhere theaters, schools, churches, daycares etc., etc., etc.,etc.,etc.,
yes WHEN IS EVERYONE GONNA GET IT???    THE ONLY REASON MUELLER DID THE INVESTIGATION WAS TO KEEP THE HEAT OFF HIMSELF, HILLARY AND OBAMA FOR THE CLINTON EMAIL SCANDEL.  TIME TO GET THE CROOKS IN PRISON.
yes So go over there and do what you say you want to do. Nobody's stopping you
yes Rochelle Askinazi I dont know, but I know who killed our mom!
yes Regarding immigration, read your Bible, Leviticus 19:34
yes Joseph Roy lets see the parents befriended some. They are actually to blame. Hard to swallow yet logically if they had not, the child would never had been raped.
no Beverly Harris so let in other countries problems instead of trying to fix the ones here already?
yes Let us compare.  I live in Indiana with lifetime gun permits and we have one bad county in the state Lake County.  Tons of bad people live in Lake county rest of state is fine.  Illinois has strict gun laws and is a shithole full of shootings.  It is definately the people not the guns killing people.   If not guns they would stab each other because they act like animals that don't care about human life.
yes Except....only water separates L. Ontario (Canada) and by N.Y. state. Look at the statistics
no Worse President ever!!!!!!!
yes https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/trump-lies-supporters-fans-believe-fake-news-facts-immigration-border-wall-a8781571.html
yes Sad for the loss of your daughter are the loss of anyones child to illegal invaders. We are Americans. The president is executing his responsibilities to the constitutional the United States.
yes Kris Landers if a known serial killer was loose in your neighborhood would you lock your doors? An illegal immigrant is a KNOWN criminal, therefore statistically more likely to engage in other illegal practices. Its really simple, logical, and moral.
yes PLEASE POST YOUR PROOF!
yes Thanks you my president! Make our country strong anh safety again!!!!
no You are not going to infringe on my Freedom of Speech as I will not infringe on your Freedom of Speech.
no Trump will take Billions from the Military, The Police and Dissater Fundd to fund the Wall.
yes Yeah that wall would of stopped him wouldnt it..
yes Uk British family not the people had no right signing the Belfour Declaration are they secretly Jewiish???
yes Thank you sir!
yes Go build the wall now
yes Dont use other peoples grief to push your personal agenda. Your own administration admitted the wall was not where the problem was. The border patrol themselves said the wall isnt the problem. Get your head out of your ass and address the actual problem. THE PORTS OF ENTRY. Every government body involved in the border knows it.
no You bet.
no Danny Jones I hope May makes no deal with the EU! You will prosper that way! Stay strong!
yes People who come to this country illegally and commit crimes and dont respect America and its laws make me sick, they should all be rounded up and put in concentration camps Id say(Im only talking about the fucking assholes) leave the good people alone and give em citizenship and health care
no He isn't trying to get elected over , he is trying to use the death to stop more deaths and the FATHER is agreeing.
yes Dave Callender this is awesome man! Godbless my brother!
yes Thank you, Mr. President.
yes All the mass shootings I believe have been committed by white Americans.
yes Kris Landers Trump Derangement Syndrome!
no If the illegal was caught then kill the illegal.
yes A real national emergency he should address.
yes American citizens should not be subjected to the risk of more harm than already having to endure. David
yes So sorry for all the families and their loss. Build the wall.
yes You a bot?
yes WE BELIEVE IT.  WORKS FOR ISRAEL.
yes In order for America to be great again ,this country Had to turn back to Jesus Christ .Our country was found by Christians and since then there have been people that are trying to destroy the biblical principles that America was founded on.Do you want this country to be great again? Then start praying .
yes Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
yes Build the wall. Stop the spread of the dumbocrap communist party.
yes Start interior enforcement & not just criminals....
yes Stay The Course, Mr. President.  Real Americans have your back.
no Alyssa Taylor and Im not saying whose fault it is. Does it really matter to the dead person whose fault it is? If I have the right of way at the intersection and someone hits me and kills me - Im still just as dead. No matter whose fault it is.
yes Renieri Ortiz there is a huge difference between a legal immigrant and an illegal immigrant.
no https://click.email.time.com/?qs=38266ca89d4e1d7be50718ff5261599b491d3ad9c09ed6fcac7e0d571805201b06c75c7010af06e19b8a2beecfdb5b4f222a595ac9f549f8a9d072b55d1a4b0e
yes God bless Mr.President Trump.
no While my hearts goes out to this handful of families, had you invited all the parents whose children were killed over last six yrs since Sandy Hook, you would have needed a stadium that held at least 50,000 people. Gun violence IS our national emergency, yet you do absolutely nothing about it.
yes An American citizen just killed 5 people - we must build a wall around Illinois. An American citizen just killed 4 people in a hostage situation - we must build a wall around Mississippi. Parkland; Newtown; Las Vegas; Charleton, SC; Sutherland Springs, TX; Killeen, TX; Aurora, CO; Aurora, IL;  etc, etc, etc... American citizens mass-murdering American citizens.  WHERE ARE OUR WALLS, WHERE IS OUR NATIONAL EMERGENCY??
yes Yea..cuz we know the 1s that have them illegally  will turn theirs in when the ban takes place..!!
yes Then why are KGB are in the WH?..
yes What he means is had he been given the money the State Of Emergency wouldn't have been necessary.
yes Yes sir!!! Build the wall now!!!
no So sad.  Stop protecting illegals and start protecting Americans!! Trump 2020!!!!
no Kim
yes lol Chicago is my hometown. Although they have some of the strictest gun laws, they're not strict enough. Another problem is that so many of the guns come here illegally from Indiana.
no BUILDING THE WALL.liberal secure ing our boarders. TY PRESIDENT TRUMP.
no If it was Pelosis kid she would give 100billion to build a wall
yes Protect yours border, protect yours notion
yes How many people have been killed by other American citizens??
no The only reason Nancy doesn't want a wall, it lets future voters in. Shameful.
yes Can we build a wall around every White American Male, you know just in case they decide to go nuts and shoot up a church, school, concert, etc??
no Shami Khan you mean BEST
yes Skip Rowland guessing you don't have to live around meth toting Mexicans. instead all you retards are making it about race. try visiting one of the cities or counties that have been infested by methicans(aka drug mules) like my area. all you can see is addicts, murder, fighting and stealing. they are living in houses that aren't supposed to be lived in by anyone.
no I literally have tears streaming down my face......  This mans loss is a tragedy that could have prevented if our government followed the law - and had courage.
yes Isiaq Olalekan Abdulraheem what good work
yes You are the best President of U.S.A
yes If you don't value human life, and oppose this wall, your opinion simply does not matter. You're nothing more than a sack of skin staring into space with nothing behind your eyes.
no Khaled Yehia Leonardo D. Rainmore
no NO FACILITIES...BUS THEM HOME!
yes I agree!! Wish your congress people agreed
no The Best President in a long time .
no Angel Roy did Mexico pay for it?
yes It won't change until a Democrat in Congress loses a child.
yes So sorry for you and your family's loss; perfect example of why we need a border wall and loopholes closed in the immigration system and stop illegals from flooding our nation.
yes Sue Carol How long have guns been around in this country Sue! People are get desensitized in this world today with death ! If they want to kill and don't have a gun they will use a car or a knife
yes YES POTUS PINOCCHIO! WHATEVER YOU SAY! CALL GUN CONTROL A  NATIONAL EMERGENCY!
yes How many lives will be saved!!!! My baby brother died from that junk they are bringing in.
yes Bull O'Neill you mean one of the 1,500 children that are missing or the aborted babies his affairs have spawned?
no Jim Villella then why does anyone build a wall? It's to keep out what you don't want in...and as far as name calling, I don't do that but there is someone in this feed that called me a name. As far as immigrants go, sure I'll welcome them in my neighborhood too if they went through the LEGAL process to be here. Trump is no politician, I'll give you that, but he loves this Country and I like what he's done so far...so we agree to disagree.
no Charlesetta Brown but we can spend a hundred and forty billion dollars a year on Medicare Medicaid food stamps whatever you want to put to it 4 illegals in this country?
yes So much blood on the left and media's hands.  Up to God who they will one day explain it to or not.  I can't judge he reserves that right.  Funny they can't even see the truth. He wins again.
no I don't blame President Trump for calling the border an emergency. Too many illegals are killing innocent lives
no Just terrible Donald!
no Eric Helmes  Yes, put Trump in jail for knowingly hiring illegals first.   But its not even an issue. Historically illegal migration ebbs and flows according to economic need.  Right now its in deep decline and has been due to low unemployment.  This isnt even in the top 100 issues we should be focusing on.   But, you know, campaign promises an all.
no Austin Wheeler I'm so sick of liberal stupidity.  Crime is a state issue.  This is a federal issue since it has to do with illegal immigration.   Stop voting Democrat, and your state will fair better.  Also, go back to school and educate yourself on state and federal issues.  You must have skipped government classes.
yes All celebrities who live in  walled mansions  should tear them down and erupt a sign out front that says  All immigrants ( illegal only ) are welcome to come in, hang out, eat my food, sleep in my bed, get an allowance.  And dont worry, we wont check your ID. We trust you.
yes So border walls will keep people from getting killed by drunk drivers. Got it.
no Because orange fear mongering fuckwhistsle.
yes Is that why you want isis in the UK, what about our safety Donald?
no Matthew Mastrogiovanni HP funny, all those things were around when Obama declared national emergencies.     And why do you focus on white supremacist and not racists of every color?
no Hey mr cry-baby how about the FULL BLOOM AMERICAN CITENZEN that killed 56 people and injure 500 in las vegas..or you suffer from amnesia as usual how about that guy..
no Move to the US brother. We need more people like you here.
yes Between 1892-1954, Ellis Island served as an immigration inspection station for millions of immigrants arriving into the United States. The first immigrant to pass though the station was 17-year-old Annie Moore from Cork, Ireland, one of the 700 immigrants arriving on the opening day on January 1, 1892.
yes So sorry for your loss. May God let you feel his love and presence. And may he lead America and our leaders to make sure this never happens again!!!
yes Could have been an American citizen. Too..just like all mass shootings!!!!!
yes this is nazi propaganda that Josef Goebbels himself could have not better crafted - disgusting and dangerous, this is not a president, this is an old man full of hate and arrogance
no and many experts say it will
yes Jason Erhardt a lot of those crimes against immigrants are done by illegal aliens.  Build the wall and enforce our laws
yes Lol fucking moron
no HOUSE OF THE RIDING SUN AMEN
no Yes, Walls will and anyone who says or thinks they won't is a special kind of Stupid.
yes If you really want to protect American families start with gun control.
yes Lyle Geyer What is safty?
yes Linda Durbin Ms Nancy  ain't giving you no wall twitter fingers. Boom
yes I fully agree that we need border security. However, a wall is not the most effective or cost efficient way to secure the border. We need a mix of physical barriers and technology, with emphasis on the latter.
yes Do they also work for mass shootings????
yes A black guy shot up his place of employment yesterday in Aurora, IL. You gonna blame blacks, now too?
yes The question is would a wall or barrier help or not help when it comes to what it's built for?  Which is deterring, slowing down or stopping illegal crossings, human and drug trafficking into the US.  It would help.   So why are the Dems opposed to that?
no ... there is a child .. separated from her family for REAL ....
no Brian Roy I personally am against abortion and think late term abortion should be illegal, but I'm not about to push my opinion on anyone so I support free choice .
yes Im so sorry for your loss... I agree that President Trump is right about the wall.
yes Peasants and criminals, just say no
no BUILD THE WALL!!!!!!
yes Maureen Hersey Brown its the democrats
yes I'm sorry for your loss, but would it hurt less had it been an American citizen that hit your brother?
yes Trumper..go get a colonoscopy and flush out the orange kool aid...
yes Praying
yes Wall would not have stopped 9/11. No wall would have stopped Stephen Paddock. All those people were in USA already. Your wall is a total fake Don. And a very expensive fake.

yes Tank you presidente  TRUMP YOU ARE DOING GOOD JOB GOD BLESS YOU
no How heartbreaking.
yes Jeremy Harbolt  And how many are you inviting to bunk up with you when they flood in by the millions
yes DAY 2 of NATIONAL EMERGENCY:  - The President of the United States, flanked by his wife and fellow billionaires, arrive at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, FL to play golf, have fun, and spend taxpayer money.  - Asylum seeking children remain in prison camps
yes They can't spell..just like 45..smh..
no We could use this guys forehead for the wall. Haha
yes Didn't u guys Brexit from the EU yet?
yes Nora Arevalo dump ad Trump this sloopy built simply Wall never will work. Trump is a Uneducated dump Redneck.
no For those of us impacted by the actions of an illegal we understand the importance of the wall as well as other border security. For those who are against this I would say walk a mile in my shoes but I would never wish that horror onto anyone.
no Build the Damn Wall
yes Using personal experiences of s minority of people to create legislation against an entire other group is..well, id use a variant of mentally handicapped, but even mentally handicapped people have more sense.   Yes, someone who was illegal killed (intentionally or unintentionally) a family member, no this does not mean that the whole group are rotten. If we applied your view point to cops, youd throw a fit. Contradictions are the playgrounds of idiots.
no U K should have a referendum on becoming the next United State, We need you President Trump.
yes https://www.npr.org/2019/02/16/695438900/munich-security-conference-reveals-a-growing-rift-between-u-s-and-its-allies  Impeach
yes White ppl being brainwashed are killing ppl in churches, movie theaters, concerts, and schools but are getting away with it because theyre white 
no Dianna Lee a wall or lack of has nothing to do with enforcing our laws immigration or otherwise. So what exactly is your argument for related to Dave's sarcastic post? Wow you all are horrible at judging sarcasm or seeing the analogy between saying one person with a trait did something bad therefore everyone with that trait must be punished.
yes Just reading through these posts proves that liberals HATE President Trump and everyone who voted for him. They spew their hateful lies and try so hard to hurt and anger. They don't get it. Most people don't live in a dark world where trolling online is their only entertainment. Pretending to be intellectually or morally superior has become the left's pathetic and desperate grab for power.
yes You're a fool and using Scare Tactics. There was just a shooting where 5 people were killed just yesterday Trump hasn't said one word about that.
no BUILD THAT WALL MR. PRESIDENT AND WHEN YOU GET IT DONE YOU CAN THROW GRUESOME NEWSOME OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT AND LET HIM LIVE WITH HIS ILLEGAL FRIENDS AND BE THEIR GOVERNOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND STAY OUT OF OUR STATE.
yes UK never really joint the EU 100%. Always felt to  be something better, no Euro currency, no Schengen agreement. I feel very sad, specially for the young British generation, because that generation is going to pay the brexit bill the next decades. but it will be a good lesson for other European countries if they think it will work better without the EU.
no President Trump is VERY RIGHT. Only FOOLS say otherwise. Because satan is fooling them.
no I am all for it 101%
no Karl Hesford cars kill people you want car control also. Thousands of babies are killed daily and you probably support that.
no And if a person from your country had killed them, lets remove all white people ?

yes Kelly Preiss Wilhelm I never want to see anyone killed period. He does talk about it though.   Its criminals which will always have guns . We could ban all guns in America.

Not argue.  Theres a lot more good ppl than bad.  Ppl has to stand up to the thugs.  Theyre out numbered by far.

Our President wants to protect your family including Democrats family but they want to destroy it , they believe the lies"  this means they don"t love their family including themselves.
yes We have been a country of law and order, build the wall, it has gotten way out of order.  We need laws enforced and people to enter the right way.
yes How about this state of emergency?  White Supremists, big polluters, pedophile priests and the like, are threats to the American Way: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and should be treated as traitors of America.
yes https://www.facebook.com/jddmcl/posts/525820511244061

yes There will never be another President like President Trump!  He does what he says, with caring and Concern God bless you

yes Law abiding citizens rarely become the bad guys ! Especially here legally. They work hard for their families !
yes If it happens to them they would change their tune. The rich and powerful who are against the wall for safety have all the protection their money can buy. Unfortunately the average person doesnt

no http://fairus.org/issue/societal-impact/illegal-immigrants-distort-congressional-representation-and-federal-programs
yes Unfortunately the Democrats dont care about your daughter or any other Americans. They only care for our replacements.
no How do they know immagration has slowed down? Seems to me alot more has gotten away with entering illegally. Because I knew a girl who dated an illegal and he beat her ass in front of her kids, got arrested...got deported...got released and was back in 3 months. Big cities dont see the problem. Live in a small town and you will see it.
yes Well thats true of any country except for sweden where the majority of crime is committed by immigrants from the middleeast etc. The same thing is happening in france,germany and england sadly.
no How did that Immigrant get into the country ?
yes Those who kill on the previous massacres around the country are not illegal immigrants
no Democrats building walls around themselves .
yes It's funny how Florida's response to a mass shooting was more guns.. why, because people in the state of mind want to make an impact, they have a sick desire to be heard. If they get stopped before they make their statement, there's less motivation
yes Carsten Adsersen.   How incredibly stupid a comment is that? Senior citizens partake in far less murders then people in their 20s.  Does  this mean we don't enforce the law against senior citizens? Liberals are so stupid
yes "Could've been my son!"
yes These families should start suing the Federal Government for substantial damages in these cases . . .
yes Jackie Lee Collins so your solution is to let in the problems of other countries instead of trying to fix the ones we already have?
no Heartbreaking. #SecureOurBorders
no The Stable Genius was so correct when calling those who appose a wall liars. The Angel families must be heard, the 70,000 overdoses a year must be taken into account.  We must have a wall as part of Border security.
yes So. If a citizen killed your daughter?  She'd be "less dead"? Grow the fuk, up.

yes Yes Dorothy!! Build that wall! TRUMP 2020!!!
yes Every Single Democrat has Walls around their homes!! Along with Security with guns!! So they dont live in the neighborhoods across our Country and they have Walls and Body Guards Many!! If they dont believe Walls Works their houses wouldnt just have Big Walls but unbelievable Security!! Also important information is their family is protected by their security and Walls! The Americans dont Matter to Anyone of Them!! They have Their own healthcare not what every American has and cant afford Medications ect.. Our American children Must Pay for Colleges but illegals dont, They arent held responsible for Crimes under hold and release. American People under Drunk Driving Laws are jailed if you kill someone under the influence ( its Murder by Our Laws) Prison People!!!
yes Erik Rouleau
no Build that wall. It'll do wonders for america
no Funny Obama declared 13 national emergencies... All for third world countries.  Trump does it for the US and people lose thier mind?  W. T.  F.

yes You just saw the future
yes We need to stop accepting fake asylum claims  they are draining our resources, and using up all our man power to actually protect our borders a WALL  won't work when  they can just walk up to our wall and demand to be taken into custody to request asylum.
yes Gun regulation may be a better idea, Chief.
yes Hal Eric Mitlitsky oh you mean AOC? Shes definitely mentally and emotionally damaged.
no Bob Segal  35% is NOT polling number.  It is the percentage of his faithful base.  Try reading the entire post.  And I could care less what his approval rating is...he is worthless
no yes true get all illeagals out every last one of them
no Bullshit! What about the latest massacre??
yes And any other party that is trying to undermine our govt by implode our  economy from with in..  if we need another civil war or American Revolutionary War then so be it. We have too many enemy's in Our America that are domestic.
yes Thank God for our POTUS. This country is all talk, no action about impeaching Nancy Pelosi our evildoer. Could someone take the Bull by the horns and get her removed.
yes And treason and drug and human trafficking and don't forget the RICO act
no Remember if you still vote democrat it only gets worse from here ... just walk away like I did
no Michael Melbert he from California.
no Legal status doesnt stop terrible things like this from happening. American citizens do these same terrible things. A wall wont stop them from happening again.
yes https://amzn.to/2EdzNcx
yes What a poor misinformed individual . I'm glad that I never had to be in a warzone with you. !

yes https://www.facebook.com/codunces/photos/a.181488645347809/1142734959223168/?type=3&theater
no There has been more than 1 illegal that is responsible for the death of innocent Americans.  And just yesterday there was a fentanyl bust that could be responsible for 4,000,000 deaths in this country.  Its a combination of problems, criminals, drugs, diseases, burden on our medical and educational systems.
yes What about white male mass shooters? Can we build a wall around them? Idiot!
yes From one incident from one illegal immigrant...stop the rhetoric. How many mass murders have we had that Donald J. Trump has done nothing but send his thoughts and prayers.
no Trump: Stop being such a ONE TRICK PONY! We have bigger problems that affect more Americans. Move on and get back to work for us. Thx
no Trump2020
yes Shady Ghaly  how about not claiming 7 next year.... I bet it will work out....
yes We are a nation built on immagrants. We judge and we should not do that..the bible says that very clearly.
yes And Mexico will pay for it!!! (oh, were not doing that anymore?)   Dont you feel just a little stupid?
yes Democrats don't care about our safety
no My Beloved Friend... Timing and Method... But... There is only one solution... If this way... The amount must be withdrawn quickly... And... The construction of the wall ends before the sixth month of the year... But the subject is dangerous... Courts... And will start thinking about isolation... You put us in trouble My Dear... Timing and method are wrong...
no You just made my point.
yes Hal Eric Mitlitsky if you think America was headed in the right direction before Trump thats the problem!
no Brian Roy many of those kids separated from their parents did try to do it the legal way. Their asylum processing is why they are being detained.
no We need the wall, but we also need mandatory e-verify.  Why is there no movement on that?
no https://www.facebook.com/253645602134/photos/a.10151302476197135/10156145259487135/?type=3&eid=ARDtN5ntbj1kAE-0fEFaId-sECcZvdmcTXMJe7N6uZh9NeOhgy4lvi1FhOk_revDACjiFBZnahXyGcDb&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARACdhoLwIRC94C5EXMLW1hhKMbsctXrBaFJSGcniDzw6XqEcZcFwImBv3pThp7EeWqZyou0lrSCUBnYhBt1NMI2RXbr3p8PQP9KReY9Mg6bng-IuQgScyKb3vIaLq1RVYpI8kog8UitEGaKelDQXOzCghqct3sC2bBoaD4X7flo0GkTvWhvl50qMztH6hQ1a7MlWN-QXekLgEfyngE4NJiKQ3TyXk_SnZ3nJ301iFMZeW4DhkNVys10A03sFWUzyDThfCmBL-5kybadT4Pzy1NCAl6dwRtqgNKrnM1dgz4nolC_pqf6hJa_B06_2BLuZ6rF9GilgLcVXktiuOflTbBnTU9ow57OUbjfCy7cLGQ1&__tn__=EHH-R
no YOU ARE A FREAKING LIAR.. There's No wall being built.  What you are doing is lying to Republicans.  The wall you are claiming to be built is just being REPAIRED and you Mr. Trump are pulling money from various departments from govt agencies to help fund an ALREADY BUILT border wall.  NOT AN INCH OF A NEW WALL IS BUILT.  LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR.        How can contractors build a wall with no blueprint or plan. Yes, there has been prototype built but nothing accurate, so when you Republicans upload a sample or portion of a wall trying to get under my skin, JUS kno that I kno that ITS NOT THE REAL THING. It's a copy it's been reported that you have lied 8000 times within the past 2yrs and I'm certain you will tell 8000 more for the next 2 more years
no Jordan Miller I think there is still outrage but personally I dont see or hear about as many Russians or Ukrainians walking or driving across the desert to illegally gain entry into our sovereign nation. We cant just have wide open deserts without any type of boundary. Its been open for years and our citizens have been having to deal with people illegally crossing borders, no Social Security number, not paying taxes, never go back to court to secure legal status and then get involved in crimes of which the wordt of course is murder whether its from drinking and driving or from gang violence. Either way, at some point we have to have a stopping point. Trump may not be a polished politician but he is the only POTUS so far who has had the balls to secure our borders
no God bless you and your family
yes Hussein Obama=Whabbist/Zionist. Get 9/11 reinvestigated now.
yes Not fooling me with one off stories.  Statistics!
no So much hate. So little time.
no 2020
yes Give me a break you POS
yes American people will receive a smaller refund this year after filing their income tax returns. The Republican/Trump tax cuts is a big scam that only benefits the rich. That's all Paul Ryan wanted; he got it and ran away.    Lower tax refunds might hurt the economy. If Americans are getting less money back, that might mean they're going to spend less of their refund. - Jordan Valinsky  Your (small) refunds will be delayed thanks to President Donald Trumps shutdown.

yes Christopher Thompson , each and every immigrant costs the taxpayers in excess of $50,000 a year. These are figures given by the Budget Accounting Office. Free medical, schooling, and now college yet those things arent offered to US citizens....
yes The president was right to declare our border crisis a national emergency. While the vast majority of illegal immigrants are not violent criminals, they have all violated the laws which are in place to keep the American people safe. Good editorial. Heartbreaking story. Im glad Trump is finally making good on his promise to enforce our laws.
no Wall today trump 2020
yes Congrat!
yes And your plans to keep American's safe from those shooting at anyone/everyone in a gun massacre is for more people to be armed?! Not taking into account how many hot heads might resort to using their gun when they lose their temper too easily?!
yes None of you will change my mind. Trump 2020
yes Jennifer Yvonne Croff then maybe a American drunk driver would hit her. What then

yes Americans must support Donald J Trump in all aspects in other to get America working again.  Donald J Trump for second term
no Democraps love the flow of drugs coming in this country more than anyone's life.  The President has to take it in his own hands to do something.
yes So true!!!!!!!!!!!
no Sorry for your loss and sorry our crooked media doesnt care enough to report the truth about this massive problem . But most of all Im sorry our former scumbag president did nothing but rob this country and didnt help with this issue at all . God bless
yes Tell Pelosi/Schumer. Its not ok for illegals to kill Americans just so theyll vote for Democrats
yes Build walls around our High Schools, Night Clubs and Post Offices then
no Trump logic that will bring her back
yes Joseph Nowik So read the constitution. Impeding the second amendment is a big no no. We've already made allowances. Now they should fund the laws in place.
no Was the dude who just murdered 5 people and injured police officers in Aurora, Il an Immigrant? Or do their lives not count because an American citizen murdered them? Just curious, Because I see conservatives mock school shooting victims, but then try to claim a moral high ground when a criminal who happens to be an immigrant attacks someone.
no God is why that illegal existed as he did. So it was god.
no Natalie Mims Friese
yes If there are no illegal crossings, then there will be no need of a border wall. Simple. Why do we need airport immigration if anyone can just cross the land border illegally?? Democrats wanting no border wall is tantamount to saying we also do not need airport immigration.
yes Build the wall POTUS
no God bless
yes All this stuff is really sad. But a wall isnt the solution. This is a propaganda tactic. He's trying to elicit an emotional response from people, rather than appealing to people's intellect.
yes Mary Larkin American people will receive a smaller refund this year after filing their income tax returns. The Republican/Trump tax cuts is a big scam that only benefits the rich.

yes Im praying for you, Mr. President! The wall will be a great blessing to this nation. Thank you for caring for the people of this nation and making the wall a priority!
no So it is a competition?! One is not as bad as the other?! It matters when some son-of-a-bitch guns you down?! What an asshat! What part of ILLEGAL ALIEN border jumper, who is not supposed to be here to begin with, do you not get?! As in if the illegals were not here they could not kill anyone you mental midget! End "Gun  Free Zones" and that kind of BS will go way down!
yes Nice and easy to understand thanks!
no THE PRESIDENT  IS RIGHT BUIL THE  WALL.
no Sue Howie, you think her death is funny? Pos
yes Sue Howie Do you know how our government works? The Democrats in Congress did that!!
yes I agree  build the wall today, great job Mr. President
no Who will mow the grass and clean my car duh wuh happen
yes Will the wall keep us safe from Democrats ?
yes George Winn it was bad when Obama was doing it, it's worse now, I don't want to imagine how bad it'll be with the next president.
no Build the wall! The Democrats want open boarders and they obviously dont care about the Americans getting killed by illegals. Wait until an illegal kills one of their loved ones then see how they feel!
yes After u laid of 800k Americans, some of who lost their homes  and apts.
no Am I the only person thinking their foreheads are monstrous?
yes Americans are much more at risk of being shot to death at work, the movies, a concert, a restaurant or school by a white male homegrown in the US than a violent attack from an immigrant. That's a fact, no matter how many grieving families you exploit to shape public opinion. Shame on you.
yes An illegal immigrant hit my mother in oncoming traffic on Cinco de mayo... Glad she is still here.no justice for his actions.
yes Deception and more lies
no I'm respect Tramp. He is the man !
no Just use that mfer's forehead
yes The.  Wooll to be. Doun
yes As a gay woman I worry more about white men than brown men
yes Wayne Brunner, I tuned in to CNN today and they had all the Democrats over there vying for more gun control. But the shooter had a lengthy criminal history and was not even supposed to own a firearm but he was able to purchase it. When he tried to get a concealed weapons permit that is when they did the big enough background check to find out that he was not allowed to own that firearm so the government ran by democrats there sent him a letter to have him turn it in. Apparently he didn't care what the letter said and they never did anything about it. The blood is on the hands of the the Region's government. So the government actually created this problem and now they want to step in and fix it simply by taking all rights away
no That is PELOSI NOT PELISI
no ;)
yes Keith Eberlein She did have Allstate took her full $100,000 and more. I am still in pain and probably will be for life. That is not the point, most illegal immigrants came here legally and then did not leave. It is sad that their child was killed but to blame all for the actions of some is not right.
no Sandra Nelson errrr Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher.
yes A guy from Kansas killed mine.
no what?
no Can we fix stupid people too? That would be helpful.
yes Its so sad Democrats are so corrupt
yes What about 167 million for Flint, Michigan water problem. Why is this not more important then a stupid wall
no Cartel not happy after paying these Democrats to stop the wall.
yes Dave Callender years ago when I was a child my parents picked up an illegal immigrant he asked if they would be so kind to give him a ride and they did he repaid them by molesting their daughter my sister in the back seat I don't know about you but I don't know any American who would repay kindness behind their backs doing this to their child.
yes If all illegal immigrants will leave America tomorrow , America as we know it  will collapse. Just saying ..
yes Build the wall, nice and tall
yes Charlesetta Brown better check with Obamas Chief Border Guard.  Apparently he isnt listening to you or any other liberal.  He supports Trump on his decision to build a wall.  Doubt the veracity google it and find out for yourself.  Interesting that a former Obama official agrees with the Trump administration.  Especially since he is the individual one should listen to.
yes Marilyn Carter look it up.
yes All in favor of the wall should volunteer their time and go help build it and donate $
no I am from Kenya, Africa but i don't support the WALL.
no Blanca, legal citizens kill other legal citizens every day in this country.
yes So sorry for your loss may God heal your heart
yes I am sorry for ur loss sir
yes The left is going to fight you even if  you cure cancer.
yes For sure
yes I can assure you, that if an illegal immigrant killed one of my children or grandchildren, I would be a one woman vigilante!!!
no Sharon Et Trina Bratley Exactly!!  Thank you.
no Blanca Gonzalez so very sorry.
yes Alejandro Sanchez and the mass shooters happened in liberal democrats state's with gun control and high crime rates
yes Erick Jones so, have you ever been to a southern border town?  If you have, you would say that.
yes The Democrats don't care about your daughter or anyone son or daughter.  And only people that live with armed security like Chucky and Nancy have Blood on their hands of Americans.  If Chucky or Nancy daughter or son or grand kids.  Would be killed.  This would all be a different story.
no Jamie Decker i would feel edoardo the same.  How did the shut down benefit the victims of the tragedy?  It did NOTHING for them.  Pathetic that you would use the victim's of the tragedy to justify an action that hurt over a million people and did nothing to benefit or honor the victims.
no Yes 100% 0lease ask AMERICANS that want the wall to fund it privately, we WILL EACH SEND MONEY PER FAMILY OR PER PERSON.
yes Mr. President, as our  duly elected Commander in Chief, We The People Demand Security for Our Country! Deploy The Army Corps Of Engineers & 50,000 Troops to our southern border immediately!  There is 1,984 miles (including the maritime miles) of border.  That is 25 Troops per mile and We want it completed in 7 Days! Carry on Commander   Which, by the way, should be plenty of time considering that's how long it took God to create the Entire Earth and everything in it! God Bless you and God Speed Mr. President.
yes Ann Coulter ....Thinks you are an idiot...Donald, that's worse than being a moron which the majority thinks you are
no Dave Callender When it becomes illegal to be named "Ann" fine but it isn't. However, have you gone to our federal immigration site? It is ILLEGAL TO ENTER HERE WITHOUT GOING THRU THE IMMIGRANTION PROCESS. You liberals just like to pick and choose what laws you want people to obey. Plus you have no problem murdering unborn humans!
yes And a young white male killed all the Kids in Parkland High School.....what is your point????? Do we do a BIBLICAL CLEANSING" and neutralize  all young white males of a certain age bracket???? See how silly this is??????????
no Julie Carr We proved it when we voted and got driver's licenses in the great state of Texas! Don't need to prove anything to you, tho.
yes What about shooters that kill children?
no Build The Wall...
yes A human killed ur daughter it has absolutely nothing to do with wether he was illegal or not.
yes A little history... https://youtu.be/0TGcU0lmINk
yes I'll say it again you only want that wall to have your b******* name plaster all over it to have something that will stand in history
no Anyone can be hurt or killed not jest legal immigrants can hurt others it's American people to
yes NO ONE IS ILLEGAL ON STOLEN LAND!
no BLIND WITCHY GRUB SATALIGHT
yes Maga
no Danny Jones I suggest filing to immigrate now  We still have guns
yes Butkowsky--BS!  He wasn't suppose to be here & her daughter would still be alive, along with hundreds every year from D-Driving & deliberate murder's by illegal's, if Obama's "Catch & Release Act" was ended & the border was secured by the barrier, technology & more agents.
no lol, stop day drinking
no Cheryl Bowler Schrager  Stupid
no Look wat el chappo got out of!! Them Mexicans goin straight under your wall lol.
yes Bill Hoeler  I'm so sick of liberal stupidity.  Crime is a state issue.  This is a federal issue since it has to do with illegal immigration.   Stop voting Democrat, and your state will fair better.  Also, go back to school and educate yourself on state and federal issues.  You must have skipped government classes.
no Chris Easley get real, someone should have stopped those boats your ancestors were sailing on to get to America
no Perry Hess  Amen.
no The Democrats are responsible for this poor girls death.  They truly do not care about American lives.  All they care about is destroying the POTUS. Its insane. MAGA.
yes Melissa Corrente face the facts
no So sorry about your Daughter and your son. Prayers to you both   Yes we need a wall. President Trump promised a wall and he will deliver the American people just that. President Trump will protect our Country and it's Citizens.
no " I didn't have to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster." Such an emergency.
yes I just do NOT understand they level of insanity in people that think this is not necessary
yes Shirley Swallow amen!
yes https://www.google.com/amp/s/foreignpolicy.com/2019/01/03/walls-dont-work/amp/
no Might be the stupidest analogy I have read. Maybe confer with your elves before writing something insane the next time.
yes The sad truth is that a wall will not keep crime and killers at bay...
no So sorry, my hat off to President Trump trying so hard to make America safe.
yes am against the wall it's a waste of time and money American please lean to love one another forgive less enjoy the life
yes WITH GOD'S HELP AND OUR PRAYERS AND YOUR DETERMINATION, SIR, WE WILL STAND WITH YOU AND SAVE OUR COUNTRY, OUR BORDERS, OUR CONSTITUTION, OUR *ICE* AGENTS, AND OUR LAW-ENFORCEMENT!!!! ........ GOD BLESS YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP ------ as they say in STAR WARS --- **YOU'RE OUR ONLY HOPE**, PRESIDENT TRUMP ----
yes We NEED to BUILD THE WALL!!! Thank you, President Trump!!
yes Legend sayeth once the great wall is completed all innocent lives taken by illegal immigrants will be resurrected. -Abraham 36:24
yes He is a good President, he knows that is the best by this country
yes How many of your ancestors were raped, tortured and murdered by Indians before America ever came to be?! Mine were being slaughtered by them in 1622 here! Next!
yes You ppl are idiots
yes what about all the school shootings?!?!? cancel schools!!!!!
yes We buried my dear friends daughter last year . Illegal and 3rd time drunk driving offender here in California . 3rd time it took Ashleighs young life . Thank you Mr President . Now we tax payers are paying for his housing , electric , heating , laundry , medical care , food ..... that need to stop and transfer those benefits to a veteran ! Push this man back over the wall or over Nancys wall !
no Anne Crossway  there are many angel families and there are also caravans of people coming our way. Time to build the wall
yes They also flew into the world trade towers but a wall wont help that.
yes By that logic we should ONLY let in violent criminal illegal border jumpers to balance out the scales of justice?! Wow, you're really a special kind of stupid!
yes 4. Day 758 of 1462 (Illegitimate Presidency) - Collusion! REMINDER - Roger Stone is a close personal friend of Donald J Trump! NOT like Mueller and Comey, but LITERALLY, Stone & Trump have been friends for 30+ years. Roger Stone worked for the Trump Campaign in the beginning. Does ANYONE really think that Con Man Donald KKK Trump was not notified that the DNC was hacked? Specifically, that Roger Stone notified Donald? The excuse will be that it was not a big deal that Russia hacked the DNC, gave the information to Wikileaks, and then coordinated with the Roger Stone and the Trump Campaign to release these emails. Haven't even gotten to the Podesta hack...  https://thinkprogress.org/roger-stone-guccifer-wikileaks-8f4d6d38a935/
yes Protection is what we all need. I agree with you on that Donald J. Trump.  but my dear man I fear there are more dangers non of us know of.  I don't know.  All I can do is keep you in my prayers and all of America in my prayers. Gobleablly that is.
yes THE PRESIDENT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!!!!!!!!
yes Kate Steinle? Oh wait, Molly Tibits? No? Mandy ? Damn! Its hard to keep up! No national emergency though? Right?
no So do guns but the government is slowly taking them away.
no deplorable TrumpTurds > Politics Ann Coulter after Trump's order: The only national emergency is that our president is an idiot
yes I don't understand the level of insanity from you idiot Trumpers who, after every mass shooting in the U.S. by a U.S. citizen, claim that "gun control doesn't work; a criminal will find a way to get a gun."  Yet, you think some idiotic wall will keep out illegal immigrants when most of the immigrants are non-violent and most of the drugs come in through legal ports of entry, ships, and airplanes.  I mean...you're just plain dumb.
no I am so sorry for your loss but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver.Who,What,Where,or Why they come from doesn't matter. Unfortunately, people are killed daily by drunk drivers in America and probably 99% are legal US citizens that kill them. I know this will never ease the pain of the loss of your daughter, but to blame a person on  the status of his citizenship is so very wrong.
yes so sorry for your loss!
no DEMOCRATS KILL BABYS DONT CARE FOR ANY USA CITIZENS GETS KIIL BUD MILIUONS BABYS IS OK TO KIIL IDONT GET IT
yes Agree.
yes Lark Jarvis you must think you have a lot more knowledge than the men who work for border patrol and deal with situations at the border every day. They do think a wall will help.  I think a lot of people like you just dont want it to help.
yes Dave Callender get your head out of the sand
yes Mike Jackson It is a big deal.
no Illegal immigrants statistically commit far fewer crimes than Americans. We see through your bullshit scaremongering.
yes Americans safety 1st!   Condolences to this family and all the families that have lost a loved one due to heinous actions of illegal immigrants....
yes PLEASE BUILD THE WALL.
yes Are you fucking kidding me we give illegal immigrants 155million  a year in welfare.
yes Charles Michael Spooner II In American Idiots45 Dreams that  Mexico Pay . This he had a Light Moment in his sick Brain.
yes Take a good look ,chuck ,nancy and maxie,hopefully one of you is next
yes YES! Build the wall! The democrats in power could care less about the citizens of our country. For them it is all about money, control and power. Sad to say but, it is true.
no Most of theses trolls are Saul Alinsky Minions following his tactics that he set forth in his book, Rules for Radicals. Alinsky was Secretary Clintons mentor in college and she embraced his methods to destroy our beloved Republic. This is far passed mere politics...
yes While this is tragic... What about the tens of thousands of children killed by gun violence? Gun violence is our national emergency
yes Stop exploiting these families  to try to gain favor for your monument.  Your fake concern is appalling and despicable.
no Ok how will they pay for it?
no why not ban alcohol, or cars? that would be just as rediculous!
yes Build that wall Mr. President
no David G. Geddis learn difference between control and vote control , itll make sense , Republicans never had vote control in either place
no Put troops 20 or 30 thousand on our border. You made the right move. It is a national emergency. Until the bullshit courts get a decision 100 more Americans could die. 1 was too many
yes Most criminals don't use a gun that they legally bought FYI
yes And what about Americans killing Amerians???
yes Thx Mr Trump...keep fighting
yes The wall must stand firm, Trump the greatest leader in our life time.
no You are spending all this money on a ridiculous wall yet we have bridges and tunnels that are going to start failing. You are an idiot. Ann Coulter is right.
no People act like Obama was the greatest thing since slice bread but he had 8 years gas prices were $4 a gallon our economy was in the tank taxes were high and not a lot was done. Not saying he didn't do anything good but he didn't have the stones to do something like this, he coasted through his 8 years.
yes Beth Ritchason those people have a right to be here. We don't need to import more criminals! DRUGS poor over that boarder and Americans die.
yes It is awfully naive to think a wall along our southern border will stop people and drugs from coming into our country.  The northern border is much longer.  Our coastlines ate much longer.  Tunnels go under walls. Ladders and drones, etc. go over walls.  The main entry point for drugs is driving right through existing and managed ports of entry.  There are smart enhancements to be made to our border security - and in some strategic stretches, that may include a barrier.  But your siren call about a wall actually hurts our countrys ability to work analytically and thoughtfully, based upon reality and data, to ID and implement smart, effective enhancements to our southern border.  Stoking fear is indeed a strategy- but not one great leaders choose.
no https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/we-people-call-president-issue-executive-order-enable-national-concealed-carry-reciprocity
no  Youre an idiot if you believe that, OR DT! Check your facts mate, youre way off  Also, please, Danny does not speak for the rest of the UK. Hope you all come to your senses soon 
yes you would have been hitlers wet dream
yes So let me get this straight.....  Only Mexicans are in our prison system for murdering?  Please correct me if Im wrong.  So yall only care about people killed by Mexicans and not by Americans?   Again, please correct me if Im wrong.  But guess what...  I KNOW BETTER.  Your are not wanting more brown people in this country.    MAKE AMERICA WHITE AGAIN!!!!!
no Young woman from NY was just murdered by an  illegal her body put in a suitcase and dumped on the side of a road in Connecticut. BUILD THE WALL
yes None of us are safe. https://www.apnews.com/Shootings
yes Tony Lamb .org  I HAD A DREAM!   I have had many end times dreams.   In my dreams I saw the destruction of America. America (Babylon) is Entering Judgement.  I saw nuclear weapons going off in most major American cities. I saw two Asteroids hit the earth. One of these Asteroids caused a Tsunami that was several hundred feet high to hit America's East coast. I saw A mega-earthquake on the west coast that caused two other faults to rip wide open causing another massive Tsunami on the West Coast. Then these earthquakes caused several major Volcanoes to erupt. I saw America ripped in half by the New Madrid fault ripping America in half from the Great Lakes down to New Orleans and this was up to hundreds of miles wide at some points.  America's heartland was turned into a great sea between two continents. And yes I saw Yellowstone erupt with a massive eruption. I was above the earth witnessing all this. But then I zoomed down and in close and I saw civil war in America. I saw Americans shooting and bombing other American's. I saw paper money blowing down the street and no one gave it a thought as it was worthless paper.  Everyone was starving and people were eating bugs, bark, leaves and grass as the hunger was so great. I saw people cooking and eating other people. I saw parents cooking and eating their children. I saw parents trading their children for a hand full of rice or beans. Cannibalism was so rampant that no one gave it a thought as it had become common and normal.   What I saw was in the Great Tribulation and I have had several dreams about this time to come. And my impression was this is NOT off in our distant future but was our near present time. I saw much, much more! The focus was America as America has sinned the most and drug or forced other nations into her abominations. But no part of the earth was spared, every nation, every island, every people, everywhere was touched by this Great Tribulation.  God has reached his limit for tolerating sin. So NOW God acts. The Holy Spirit came to me in a dream and hovered above my bed and spoke 4 words to me. "AMERICA IS ENTERING JUDGEMENT'. I prayed, I cried and I sobbed, I cried so hard because I knew what was to come.   A great deception will soon manifest and the whole world will be mesmerized by it. The faithful needs to be aware of this and not fall into this trap because many Christians will be deceived by this.   I believe this will be alien disclouser and the fact proposed by the media that aliens seeded life on this planet and they are here to help mankind. These aliens are demons straight from hell and they are NOT here to help mankind but to deceive us.  I saw Fallen Angels walking the earth destroying everything and everyone before them and no weapon could harm them.   REVELATION 9: 14 & 15 14 SAYING TO THE SIXTH ANGEL WHICH HAD THE TRUMPET, LOOSE THE FOUR ANGELS WHICH WERE BOUND IN THE GREAT RIVER EUPHRATES.  15 AND THE FOUR ANGELS WERE LOOSED, WHICH WERE PREPARED FOR AN HOUR, AND A DAY, AND A MONTH, AND A YEAR, FOR TO SLAY THE THIRD PART OF MEN.  This scripture says 4 Fallen Angels will be released upon the earth and will kill a third (1/3) of mankind. (I was shown this verse after my Fallen Angel dream.)  Also a Great Shaking is coming to America soon. I do not know what form this will take, economic collapse, war, Asteroid strike, Earthquake, Super Volcano, Tsunami something big IS COMING. And when it gets here every person in America will be shaken to their very core.  ALSO I know the Rapture is very soon also. I don't know when this will come in relationship to these other events, before, during or after these other events BUT IT IS COMING AND SOON.  So pray, look up for your redemption draweth nigh. BUT we who are faithful in Jesus Christ will be raptured out of here and WE WILL NOT BE HERE for the Tribulation.  God Bless you, and God keep you and yours.   www.tonylamb .org  Your Watchman on the Wall For Jesus Christ. Tony Lamb
yes Danny Jones thank a Democrat for that
yes Oh God misrepresentation at its finest
no legally
no This shot just goes to show how many of you have never been near the border, there's a hard fast boundary already built there
no Absolutely need the wall!!! Many of  Those who dont want it are benefiting from drug sales & sales of children and their body parts. It is sick that people are so naive to think that some dems have their best interests in mind. They have their own pocket books and bank accounts in mind!!! President hadnt even taken a salary for all the crud  thrown at him!!!
yes Adrianna Anders how about the word leftist- u will find rapist impeached clinton, pedophile jailed anthony wiener, kkk robert byrd, mao, lenin, stalin, murderer ted kennedy, groper cory booker, wife beater keith ellison, kkk governor northam, castro, maduro, margaret sanger....that's what i see when i look up leftist...i dont feel safe
yes Useless expensive wall. Not the answer.
yes That is a cruel response to a griveing father !!
yes I totally understand seriously the need to keep a promise , Even I have to keep a promise.   A wall is not the answer still , if we  had more man power and on site fingerprinting at the border control and ports of entry this wouldnt happen. My prayers deeply goes out to those who are effected by this but he is using it .   Its truly depressing to see Trump used tragedy events to gain political pull in getting what he wants .   I know real tragedy and it happen from a on duty US sheriff and it effect two Americans lives and family members . But Im not here for that .  You really need to stop Trump, go enjoy your vacation because work continues on Monday .
yes Thanks Mr President we believe in you
no A wall will force those seeking refuge to come through a legal port of entry
yes Protect Americans by doing something about gun violence
yes God Bless  from Tn
no More crimes are committed by U.S. citizens than by undocumented people. Walls are not needed. As the Pope says, we need to build bridges, not walls.
yes In South Africa we can just hope and pray for a President like Trump...sad but a fact
no MAGA
yes What about all the white American males that have killed 100s of innocents people including young children with assault rifles? Yet 45 hasnt done crap to implement common sense gun laws. Hed rather feed you this BS.
yes Bob Segal Who are you, faceless FB page, a RUSSIAN TROLLER?
yes Yes we need the wall for our kids and grandchildren.
no CNN'S Jim Acosta dissed Angel Families by SCOFFING THEM IN THEIR FACES, then NEVER APOLOGIZING when, Angel Moms answered President Trump that ALIEN INVASIONS OF BAD PEOPLE IS REAL.
no Do your homework a wall does not stop the Majority of the people from gaining access to America.  We have air space, two oceans, two foreign borders and stolen passports-get real and address the REAL PROBLEM!  Corporations like Trump's should not cheaply employ them, more agents needed at the border crossings, and a Visa with a finite expiration date to be admitted in the USA.  America is free, but not to the World. The illegal immigrant was from Where?  American Nationals commit hit and everyday!
yes IF anone cant' see what Our President is doing they are Lost in another world because he is  Fighting for us.. Our Safety
yes Dante Noel  You, a non-American have no say in MY COUNTRY!!!  You should be ashamed of yourself for disrespecting an honorable firefighter!!!
yes Jim Butkowsky , over seven percent of the illegals coming into our country end up in prison which is higher than our legal population.
yes So sorry for your loss, praying for you and your family.. America first #Trump2020
yes Sing with me!  All in all  It's just a  tiny dick and no wall!
yes NO WALL 4 U 666 !!
no If anyone deliberately hurts or kills one of your family.  I for an eye tooth for a tooth.  Reports do nothing but appease the courts
no Simon Kitson  Seriously? That was downright idiotic. (Going for #4, now, because morbid curiosity is getting the better of me) lol!  You do realize Melania is a *legal* citizen, right?  Have a great day!
yes Were with you!
no Enforce mandatory e verify!
no You're not gonna sell this illegal move with more of your baseless fear-mongering, Comrade. Prison awaits!
yes Such BS, only your base thinks you are a genius!  You use people like puppets.
no Reading thru these comments i can very well see why this country is in the shape its in .heres a man trying to make this country better and theres people on here acting like spoiled kids that refuse to admit hes doing a good job .its not just about killing or drugs or rape or draining our benefits programs .putting our hospitals in financial problems .drunk driving or even working and sending the money back to mexico and other places its all these and more .money that could help seniors .vets kids .drug addicts .single parents and to try and fix our health ins issues are going for  these illegals .not to mention so called border security. Do you people think they all go to points of entry to come in ?do you know how many miles are open for them to come in .stop and think people .some of you act like you know more about what goes on then people that work and deal with it every day .unless you know for fact dont try to act like it is .all of this dident just start been going on for years .Trump is the first one to care enough to try to stop it .and all the other issues you are bringing up give the man time .hes trying hes not only fighting the stupid democrats hes fighting fools like the ones on here
yes BUILD THAT WALL!
yes People, who lost relatives especially children because of the STUPIDITY of some in government,  should be taken to court, my suggestion is to punish the guilty if not from the laws of this country, which I see is one sided, but by The Court of The Hague. The same court that convicted many NAZIS and many COMMUNIST dictators. There are some in this great country who have infiltrated the FBI, the department of Justice and damaged the reputation of the USA. They get away and write books that the STUPIDS buy. We have been brainwashed for many years, now we have the so called GREEN movement, another version of the COMMUNIST doctrine, which if any one researches, it's just the same as the NAZIS did.....God Help us all Amen
no Jeff Cole , what about the millions of babies being killed through abortion that the liberals think is a woman's right ?   Do you feel their pain also ?
no Whats really happening , when we try to share info,   clamp down    Really??????????
yes Sr. As a father Im Very Sorry ! Im so sick of the SCUM that sits in the senate and House speaker is a Pig and Traitor
no Danny Jones stfu nutt. He will take it as well as brexit ssh up . Trump is a felon, will steal your house for his wall. Do not encourage stupid
yes You're a fucking moron. Quit fear mongering.
yes Carol Starr i dont like your fucking country
no https://www.amazon.com/Trump-Kings-Darren-W-Freeman/dp/1733572708/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=darren+freeman&qid=1550345578&s=gateway&sr=8-1
no Im going to be waiting for the next Democratic President to declare an Emergency Crisis on guns! #FuckTrump
yes Still,  using children's deaths to make political points.  Trump is one sad lowlife.  Your gun deaths are your national emergency
yes The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt. I am the LORD your God. Leviticus 19:34
no "Americans kill americans" so anything else doesnt matter just import everyone elses problems? Also my comment bothered you enough that you needed to seek praise by posting it in your facebook page lol. Have a great night!
yes lol no it wouldn't
no Trumps right and the majority of AMERICANS AGREE!!
no Your pain doesnt equate to spending my money. Your feelings have nothing to do with me or my state, keep your goddamn hands off my checkbook.
no i agree except for the whipping, and we do need a wall so we don't waste expenses on them
no TRUMP   365   #365AllTheTime  #365ZeddxKaty    katy.to/365Video
no Devin Diamond I dont believe being illegal was the reason they didnt press charges
no And they will continue to kill
yes We love you sir! Make Philippians 4:13 your strength and protection and we will continue to pray for you!
no Fake news.
yes I have never heard one valid reason why the wall should not be built.
yes https://www.facebook.com/FoxNews/videos/1916164388471460/?t=53
yes I would call you Helen Degenerous..but that would be an insult to her..
no TRUMP IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!! He needs to go!!! National emergency but yer playing golf!!!
yes What we lock our house
yes Or maybe a narcissist idiot!
yes Try taking a good look at the northern border.  No wall.  Other methods. Terrific security.  And they aren't working on stopping poor terrified people trying to get away from conflicts we are partly responsible for...they are trying to make sure nobody gets to us through them and pulls another 9/11.  This wall is a waste of money.
no So do gated communities
no Karen Kelley Your comment reflects no intelligence.  Using victims as props is despicable.
yes Chris Holman seriously?? Pearl Brown Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR
yes Yea.  And then go into the bowels of cities and clean whats here.  File citizenship papers or your out of here
no Trump you are a disgrace to the USA. This is NOT a national emergency, its a political strategy. I am sure your strategy will be thwarted by the sensible powers that be..
yes If we would donate a dollar for every comment then we would have more then needed for the wall
no If he was here not legally why was he even out On a bond ! And not on hold For departure to his country like Down here we do!!
yes #fuckthewall
no Sadly unless it happens to the Democrats in office they will never give credence to the pain it causes!
yes How about posting the pics of everyone killed by GUN violence!?!
no James Ellis That was a joke on how Trump pronounces it, you fucking moron.
yes What about the parents whose sons and daughters were killed and are killed by AMERICANS almost on daily basis?What kind of WALL are you gonna build to protect AMERICANS  from being killed by AMERICANS?
yes Kris Landers Obviously Kris here has stopped going to her TDS treatments folks? It's not here fault!
yes Facebook full of comments from foreign accounts that support propaganda and spread discord. Zero votes.
no We want the wall.
yes Bob Segal Democrats read books - you should try it sometime.
no Also what about the countless people of colour  and other minorities who are shot at without any provocation. Such insecure Americans are the real threat. So please go ahead and build a wall. And keep us out, thanks.
yes There he goes, scaring the white folks again.
yes You meant to write something about the kickbacks from all those for-profit detention companies and all those contractors, I'm sure, since we all know Fauxtus has shattered both foreign and domestic emoluments clauses numerous times.
yes Valerie Siggson FAKE NEWS!
yes Sorry to hear about your daughter,  Yes we need to stop them and all killings.
yes Angel Roy you're dog wasn't a captured engineer that can build tunells 60 feet under ground???
yes Maria Frett they've been over run by Muslims. The EU forced migration has ruined their country. They've been turned into a 3rd world country by immigrants forcing sharia law in their country. Same as they're trying to do here. President Trump has stopped it and refused to sign the UN Migration Pact which basically calls for no borders. He is saving our country from becoming like Europe. Look up the yellow vest protests going on in Europe and Canada.
no Bother Democrats don't care.    Vote Republican!!
no Will Ihrke other presidents have called for a wall he's the only one with enough guts to do it.
yes Cant share a pic lmao
no Here here

yes "Dave Callender, we've got you covered because Ann had Allstate"
no I dont think that Is a good idea
yes A well run company or country runs best on rules and laws.   You uphold those rules and laws and the people who enforce them and you have peace and prosperity.
no Build that wall.
no THIS IS MORE EFFECTIVE    " The border region receives boundless solar energy, and has significant natural gas and wind resources. Its also suffering from extreme drought, and water shortages are predicted to get worse. Farming is exceedingly difficult. And jobs are often scarcein part because of lack of water and power. If an energy and water corridor were built, the facility owners would protect their properties. Transmission, gas and water lines would be monitored by companies, states and federal agencies, as many elsewhere are now. And the plants could be integrated with security walls or fences.

yes How long have you been THAT STUPID Trumptard?
no Mitch Haynie so one tragedy justifies a million people forced into economic hardship for no purpose?  The shutdown accomplished nothing other than putting people into hardship, hence the national emergency declaration.  Your false dichotomy isn't working here.
yes A wall is not going to stop immigrants all together!!  Let's change the laws.  No more welfare assistance, for the ones that are already here (legally and illegally) are abusing the system by having children and depending on the taxpayer to cover for their children upbringing.  Let's use technology to check all tractor trailers crossing the border full of immigrants like thermal imaging cameras, let's put some device to prevent anyone from digging tunnels.  All the immigrant already in this country, MUST SPEAK THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, otherwise send them back, THEY MUST PAY TAXES, but most of all, THE IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL ACTS MUST BE DEPORTED TO THE AUTHORITIES IN THEIR COUNTRY!!  Even the immigrants criminals are being supported at the expense of taxpayer.
yes Well the Manafort judge certainly doesnt see any witch hunt here!   She says Konstantin Kilimnik is significant to the Mueller investigation because he was a link between the Russian government and the Trump campaign.
yes Demonrats are too stupid to realize! These families are getting victimized TWICE!!! Not only by the drunk driver! But, by a drunk driver who wasnt supposed to EVEN be here!!
yes Open borders and the new dependency class = votes for Dems at tax payer expense.
yes https://youtu.be/AIVdqAKcbwE
no Tom Barker not enforcing our immigration law is no way to run a country.
yes https://www-nytimes-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/us/ethan-couch-affluenza-jail.amp.html?amp_js_v=a2&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQCCAE%3D#referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2018%2F04%2F02%2Fus%2Fethan-couch-affluenza-jail.html
no Danny Jones  Thank you for your sentiment.  Wish we could get the sheep over here to wake up and see reason before we end up in a civil war.
no Prayers for this angel family. So sorry!
no Build the wall. Put safety first.
yes I love it Donald turmp
no Arlene Cirocco I always try to give people the benefit of doubt. Sometimes they know what they are talking about. So please, dispel my thinking you are a fool, by responding with some cold hard facts to back up your seemingly uninformed and ignorant post. Again, PLEASE RESPOND WITH FACTS TO BACKUP YOUR COMMENTS.
no Ed Barnat hmm what is TDS?
yes Wondering why exactly?  I mean, since there was no national emergency then, either...but maybe you just meant to point out that if there had ever been one obviously the GOP would have had the trophy wall erected LONG ago, so it's blatantly clear there is no national emergency.
yes What about all the mass shootings, what do those families do?
yes DA Medina have you ever heard of MS13???
yes Thats right.  Just think if it was your family members killed or addicted how would you vote? The dems discuss me but I am beyond discuss with the Republicans that are not supporting our President.  All we can do is for the best President and the USA
yes Aurora, Parkland, Vegas... should I continue?
yes So by your logic lets import some more to be sure they have equal representation?! You really  are a special kind of stupid!
no Very sad, but super rare
no The One'n'Only Mr. Fake News manufactures a Fake Crisis that he tries to sell it to us with nothing but Lies and Fake News Alternative Facts!!!
no I know if my daughter was murdered by an illegal,  though I would probably  end up in hell I would have to seek vigilante revenge..
no WHY is declaring a National Emergency to address a National Emergency in The United States considered wrong? There are 28 current National Emergencies, most of which involve emergencies in OTHER countries, that were declared by the previous POTUS.     ALL of these so-called declared National Emergencies could be applied to the actions of those people who are ILLEGALLY crossing the Southern Border of the United States of America.   IF apprehensions are down, it is ONLY because of a concerted effort to deter entry, that DETERMENT costs the taxpayer, BILLIONS of dollars each year. The press likes to declare that most drug apprehensions are at legal crossings which is true; however, how do we know how many drugs are successfully transported across our unsecured border every day?      A wall is a realistic, and economic, approach to denying illegal entry into this country.  Why do you think walls there are built around prisons, the Vatican, Israel, "homes of the rich and famous and most other countries.  BECAUSE the expense of employing many guards with guns to protect 2000 miles of border is TOO expensive and NOT nearly as effective as a wall!    "The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on United States Taxpayers"  report put the total cost of illegal immigration at $135 billion a year, while claiming undocumented immigrants paid only $19 billion a year in taxes. That leaves a net loss to local, state and federal governments of $116 billion a year." (* 2017, FAIR's)  This does not include cost of loss of life, property, and Democratic stability.
yes BUILD THE WALL!!!!!

yes Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin 7) Tax Cuts  ~Biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history by signing the Tax Cuts and Jobs act into law  ~Provided more than $5.5 trillion in gross tax cuts, nearly 60 percent of which will go to families.  ~Increased the exemption for the death tax to help save Family Farms & Small Business. Nearly doubled the standard deduction for individuals and families.  ~Enabled vast majority of American families will be able to file their taxes on a single page by claiming the standard deduction.  ~Doubled the child tax credit to help lessen the financial burden of raising a family.  ~Lowered Americas corporate tax rate from the highest in the developed world to allow American businesses to compete and win.  ~Small businesses can now deduct 20 percent of their business income.  ~Cut dozens of special interest tax breaks and closed loopholes for the wealthy. 9 in 10 American workers are expected see an increase in their paychecks thanks to the tax cuts, according to the Treasury Department.  ~More than 6 million of American workers have received wage increases, bonuses, and increased benefits thanks to tax cuts.  ~Over 100 utility companies have lowered electric, gas, or water rates thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  ~Ernst & Young found 89 percent of companies planned to increase worker compensation thanks to the Trump tax cuts. Established opportunity zones to spur investment in left behind communities.

yes If you people think a border wall is going to keep illegals out, you've got another thing coming. It won't.  Huge waste of money and will do irreparable damage to our environment. We can find a better way than hate and division. We are better than walls.

no If you drive on the road with no insurance and somebody wrecks into you its your fault because you shouldnt be on the road without insurance in the first place , same thing for immigration, if your over here illegally and you get into trouble then its your fault because you shouldnt be here in the first place, but places like Illinois gives drivers license to illegal immigrants who usually dont drive with insurance.  Where is the common sense in that ?
yes Every day, 47 children and teens are shot in murders, assaults, suicides & suicide attempts, unintentional shootings, and police intervention.  Every day, 8 children and teens die from gun violence:  4 are murdered 3 die from suicide 1 killed unintentionally                          That vast majority of children gunned down in America are KILLED by NATIVE BORN AMERICANS.    https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/15/parkland-gun-violence-children-teens

yes Attached is a link to official Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) statistics on border apprehensions for our Northern, coastal, and Southern borders for FY 2000 - 2017. Total apprehensions in FY 2017 were approx 20% of what they were in FY 2000. However, our current president says the stats HE HAS from CBP indicates an increase: https://www.cbp.gov/
yes The wall will have to start deep underground. Apparently, they are not good at climbing walls, but they are very good at tunnels. Maybe they fly. I don't think the wall is a good idea. Will be better to end poverty and injustice in the world.

no Jrg Sudharson Vimala Build a wall around each such person instead? Because walls will keep us safe... I can't even quote that line without feeling like an absolute imbecile. Mr President sure has some confidence...

yes Build the Wall....
yes " BUILD THE WALL NOW "
yes Illegal immigrants drive in America without insurance and cause accidents, which drives up peoples insurance rates, they eat up lots of resources that are meant to be provided for our fellow Americans.
no You would want people to knock on your door, instead of illegally  coming into your home.
yes Jim Smith No, a concerned American citizen who cares about our country. I have a right to my opinion just as you do. Can I call you a TROLL for disagreeing with me?????
yes We're all living in mama bear snake pit. I gotta take a chit right here in mama bear snake pit. And when we die she gets all our pills from our medicine cabinets for that toothless old hags' opiod thrills. I sing it to the tune of "yellow submarine".  It doesn't bring my dog back but it helps me cope with that toothless old hag. She's not my wife. I would never let that hag touch me.  She's just a vindictive evil old toothless miserable old hag.
no Chris Mallory   Not quite zero.
yes Besty, you don't get it.  If we don't put the wall up there won't be any resources to help those who really needs it.  First things first, secure the BORDER

no My neighbor's daughter was killed while visiting a friend in Detroit. I want a wall around Detroit!
yes So would free health care. That would help a lot. How about our doctor's being able to practice medicine according to their oath and NOT answer to the insurance man. That might help. Release the free energy patents. Leave the wall down build a hemp trade and build a better earth.
yes We agree with you 109%, President Trump. Thank you for trying so hard to protect us all (EVEN the jerks that have been against you since day one )!  God bless you and your family greatly, Sir!
yes Some of you are just missing the whole point of the fact illegal means illegal no matter if they are killers or sweet little old ladies...ILLEGAL means they are not supposed to be here without going through the immigration laws and procedures...smh
yes Veronica.. you are being played by Mr Trump's satanic bilderberg group Freemason demons.  They are the MSM, CIA, KKK, ISIS and skull and Bones fraternity and Russell trust that are doing ALL the human trafficking and heroin and fentanyl manufacturing in the world for the past 243 years thru the US embassies and Rothschild Freemason colleges and council on foreign relations and Bohemian Grove club.   SO Sorry.. but paying the 9-11 bombers $$$ for a stupid senseless wall is not going to fix anything..
yes Why aren't the moms of American civilians murdered in shooting sprees by American citizens called "angel moms" too?
no President Trump!  I've heard a statement made by you on a Non-Local Media Website that may or may not be accredited, but it mentioned that you were going to stop the Mennonites, their drug trafficking operations, and other reports that state that the Mennonites and Mormons are working together in Chihuahua, Mexico and are corrupting Mexican Officials!  And since we all know the whole ordeal spread throughout Mexico and South America!  It's big!  Thanks!  But have you ever thought about stating that specifically in front of the live Broadcasts, rather than pointing out the various groups of folks being hurled into this, due to the Jewish Sects if Amish, Mennonites, Quakers, and Mormons!!!!
yes #Impeach #TrumpForPrison #AbuseOfPower
no Mr.Donald J.Trump The Great
no #buildthatdamnwall

yes No it wont nice try the worst human trafficking is here in Michigan is u going to stopit here.
yes Robbie Reid look in the mirror.
yes Here is an idea... there are 2,738 prisoners on death row, with the average time spent on death row being 15 years.  Each prisoner costs the government a minimum 31,000 per year.... that is 84,878.00 per year if you multiply that times 15 years... wow 1.2 billion, if we could shorten the time on death row to one year instead of 15 we would have a great solution for funding of the wall. Just saying.
yes We have more mass shootings than all other countries combined and you do nothing, but three people were killed by illegal immigrants last year and its a national emergency?
yes Thais esses comments sao legendary low key
no This crisis has existed for decades and didn't get any better after you kicked off your 2016 campaign. But you did NOTHING for two years. Meanwhile thousands more Americans have been robbed, raped and murdered. Enough talk. Start building the damned wall and kick-start deportations of ALL illegals.
yes Kevin smith, ha so you believe in an armed revolution very gung ho of you to recommend that to the UK. Be we are not Gun mad unlike you lot who don't deal with the problem thats killing your kids

yes An American citizen who was not supposed to own a gun killed 5 innocent people yesterday in Aurora, Illinois. Too chickenshit to talk about that?
yes Lisa, the wall may not be a perfect solution, but it will take considerable effort to go over it or under it. There are areas of the border that allow anyone just to walk in. No resistance whatsoever.
yes Jan Lynn Simpson  Prioritize all you want .  Build that wall . Then build more of that wall . We just can't get to much wall .
yes Illegal drugs killed mine Fake media and uncaring Demolition Dems haters of Justice & citizens & security sanctuary for illegals and homeless & criminals what can we do these fools are evil

yes Great job mr president dont give up the fight. The swamp is worse then anyone ever thought
yes How much insulin could be bought with the wall money to save those who can't afford it...know any diabetics?  How many homeless Veterans could be placed with the wall money?  How many crumbling bridges or roads could be fixed with the wall money?  How many schools and businesses could be protected from gun violence with the wall money. There are far worse emergencies in America today, and you know it. Which is why you are at your fancy resort stuffing your face with omelettes and playing golf. Shame on you.
no The spending bill should not have been signed. Too much money to support illegals and restricting where the wall is built.
yes American soldiers went in Middle East and killed hundreds of thousands of innocents. Build that wall and stay inside yourselves
no Asha Artis the innocent illegal I guess. Bet you would feel differently if this was your kid. Bet you would be calling for the end of illegal immigration also. https://fox17.com/news/local/undocumented-immigrant-snuck-into-lebanon-home-raped-6-year-old-girl
no Build the wall...we the people should vote on the wall..
no Our  sympathies  Build the wall Build two. Walls 100 yards apart.
yes Donald Trump is 100% right
yes ....and a white person killed how many innocent people in Las Vegas...how many innocent kids got killed by a white kid while at school..how many innocent people got killed while watching a movie at a movie theater by a white person..how many people got killed while attending church services by a white person..just asking for an illegal immigrant who only comes to do a job a white person doesnt want to do..
no Nancy Hissa Is nevyconfuse a real President Obama, with a fake one!
no Lisa Mann sovereign countries have borders AND walls. Walls work. Fact.. That's common sense.
yes Wall all the way
no #YuriGiovanni
no Yes, we must all understand that a sample size of 1 is NOT statistically significant!   But, statistically speaking, there is a higher chance of you being killed by a fellow citizen than by an immigrant!    #MyopicPresident
yes Linda Gurtz Hildreth probably fake ones like the Obama birth certificate.
yes My Heart... The declaration of a state of emergency should have occurred at the beginning of 2017... And not now...
yes So sad.. May she RIP.. GET THAT WALL UP QUICK..
yes You have to be a special kind of stupid to believe that...
yes Louis Messier you need nothing. Yoz need an other Goverment you insane naive Corrupt Bigotic Blasphemic TROLLS of Trumpsupporter the lowest Level of the USA Society.

yes Curtis Rice Don't make posts when you are drunk.  I did it before and it always comes out wrong.  Just trying to help.
yes Nora Arevalo have you heard of mole traps?
yes Every mass shooting in 2017 was carried out by American born Christian males!
no Need the wall AND total immigration reform: end of birthright citizenship, etc.
no A strangers apology means little. But as Parent and Patriot there is ZERO tolerance for this. We have OSHA for work place regulations, to the point most can no longer DO THEIR JOBS. Yet we allow THIS. Inact few laws & slmost no regulation that we actually deploy. Sickening. God Bless and God Speed to your lost loved ones. I will fight for our Freedoms and Sovereignty (foreign or domestic) until I can no longer. Which means if I'm lucky, I'm 80...and still have an eye and steady hand!!!!!!!
yes Where is my Trump bonus? Taxes are terrible this year? National debt has increased by $2 trillion! What was your Tax this year?
yes Should we deport all white people to Europe then?  Almost every single mass murderer is White.  Huh?
yes Trump has done nothing but spread hate and divide this country.the big tax break was for the rich and 72% of Americans will have to pay back money. Did you know the rich don't have to pay federal taxes? The rich take care of each other.  Trump is not taking any pay for being a President because its being made up by all the extra money from his tax break. I didn't say he wasn't stupid.
no As the wall is being built, I hope Mr. Trump will take other measures to keep criminals out of our country.  Anyone else feel this way?
no NOT WHEN SOME OF PEOPLE'S That is already here in the u s a  then all they doing is bringing in a hellve lot more here just like the Mexican PEOPLE'S who came over by one of the Mexican gril that was seen on ((Monday)( and she was with a white man then she was muder by a black man )) and why was she killed ? And Why do woman's go have naked  don't they know that they asking for anything can happen too them !!!

yes John Burks stops the inmates from walking out and taping your mother or wife though....
yes I hope the wall doesnt work so everyone who is for it looks even more stupid.
yes Fantastic President trump you are doing a great job for all American families. Keep up with good job.
yes Lisa Mann no, it will be difficult to go over, and it will have cement footers.  Since you will be able to see through it, border patrol will see digging or other things that could show other avenues around the wall.  The slats make it difficult to go through.  So, with other things that Trump asked for, like more agents and technology (which was in his package they denied, and then passed with 1.4 billion for a wall) the wall will slow down any potential illegals.  If by chance they could make it across, they will be apprehended immediately,  which doesn't happen now in areas without barriers.
yes Soooo there are no home grown "white" bad people?
yes Veronica Torres, What Do you mean by they??? By the way are you Hispanic? If you are, I just hope that you are kind, to the undocumented immigrants, because sometimes they can experience the worst cruelty from their own kind.!!!
no Kathy Finley Hayden its way more than 35%
yes I should have known that David was from the left coast, land of fruits and nuts! !!
yes Janie Rogers Doss   True. But that would be 17,200 less if Republicans would get their heads out of their asses and the NRA out of their pockets.
yes Corey Groff sure  how about we do SOMETHING about the real national emergency?
no All that money going to that wall could help people who can't afford health care who need assistance with mention health
yes We support you and fully agree with you!!! Build that wall because Congress and the Democrats don't know how the rest of us live and go through. The rest of us don't have a security detail or the money to invest in high quality security systems.
yes Please make them razor sharp, and able to electrocute - evil 
yes Its against the constitution by using money from the treasury
yes Oh, sweetie...that degree from Trump U. didn't serve you well.
yes Bad people walk on through imaginary borders.
yes Bush gave the MONEY for the damn wall, to OBAMA TRAITOR! They all wanted the damn wall long  ago, SHOULD ALREADY had the damn wall! Hell with Congress for all this B.S.
yes Mr President dont forget america is build and made from emigrants from all over the world
yes Danny Jones why you say that ? What is your culture and  what going on ?
yes I'm very sorry you and your family have to endure such pain due to the Progress Liberal stupidity.
yes Betsy Hammond:How much money do you think could be put towards these issues if not for the billions of dollars spent on illegal immigrants.
yes Finish the wall...Trump 2020!
no https://www.facebook.com/423550194411366/posts/1736144173151955?sfns=mo
no So comes you aint sharing sad stories of those parents whose children are victims of gun violence; gun violence perpetrated by your supporters?
no Protection of American families, I guess military families don't fall under that category....https://www.foxnews.com/us/military-families-warn-of-unsafe-housing-rats-toxic-mold-and-more
no Emily Neal underground weapons will always make it into the hands of criminals thus we dont need to make laws making it harder for upstanding citizens with no record to own them!
no Barbara Samuel and you can CLEARLY see July 16, 2018/ 9:25am & 9:26am, you cant make that up can you?
yes Chet Bentley Yahweh (That's HIS Name NOT God) had NOTHING to do with her death!. WHO is responsible? Answer: The Evil One who I will NOT honor with a name because his name has never been removed or changed, JUST MULTIPLIED! Which ONE resides in YOU? PRAY NOW to be SAVED and SEALED in Yahweh the Father and Yahshua His Son, Revelation 14:1 HalleluYah! Hebrew: "Praise ye Yah!!"
yes HELLO DONALD, you are building a wall to protect your population from the immigrants, but you are asking for immigrants and terrorists from the Middle East and Africa. In addition, you are still responsible for ISIS, for the entire situation in the Middle East named friends of Syria. What kind of person are you ???
no Corrupt 45 doesnt care about all the parents who had their little children killed at school. Corrupt 45 doesnt care about the Americans killed in the Las Vegas Massacre! Corrupt 45 doesnt care about the kids killed at that night club outside of Los Angeles! Corrupt 45 doesnt care about the 5 people killed yesterday. Corrupt 45 the worst president in American History!
yes The wall around Obama's property works, yet he doesn't want a wall to help our country.
no 5 Americans killed in Aurora, Ill yesterday by an American.  This was one of many mass shootings by fellow Ameicans.  Border Security, Yes!  Everyone wants Border Security. But one illegal immigrants crime doesn't justify the expense of building a Wall that experts say can't serve the purpose for which it is  being built.
no Literally the last opinion we should be listening to.
no Dave Callender.  Don't be asinine.
yes 100 % right the best president in my Lifetime for sure
yes So sad, to much of this happening.  Build the WALL
no Ok lets put it to u this way if you baby was on the other side of the wall crying how many ways could you think of to get to your baby sit down and write down all the pros and cons then on another piece of paper it the Military was holding your baby list all the ways you think you could honestly do to get thru them to get to you baby
yes So sorry for the loss of your daughter! Pray for Trump!
no "Fixed fortifications are a monument to the stupidity of Man." George Patton
yes I'm sure a wall would have prevented all the school shootings that happened last year
no #Greatestpotusever
yes lol
yes Eddie Almeyda my act of kindness today is not to respond to your misunderstanding.
yes American citizens with legally purchased weapons have been killing children in our schools - when will that be declared a national emergency?
yes Can America invade Alberta and make it the 51st state
no Veronica Torres precisely
yes SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS!  PRAYING FOR YOUR FAMILY!
yes How about all the daughters killed by Americans with guns, people that shouldn't have guns, what about that moeron?
yes Mr. Trump is right.
no God bless u and ur entire family
yes No wall!
yes Jeanie Railsback that is why we should take care of ourselves instead of running to doctors and seeking pharmaceuticals for the sniffles.
yes Trump you have reason, make the wall and accept immigrants with degree and real capacity to become a citizen of your country. I admire and respect your ideas. Socialism promotes chaos and help countries don't become poor, this way no one go try illegal immigration. :)
yes Sheryl Whitfield-Tolliver  Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR
no Marla Herring Huh?
yes Make America SAFE AGAIN!.........give Trump his Four Walls!!!
yes Lisa Mann no.
yes My husband and I support the wall!!
yes Nancy Pelosi And Chuck Schumer Just  approved  1.3 Billion Dollars  for Funding  to Build part of the Southern  Border Wall ,,,. So I take it that their 1.3 Billion funded part of the wall is Morally O.K   .But Trumps working on  funding for  5.6 Billion for another  section of the Southern Border Wall....This  is not morally Ok and wrong in Chuck and Nancy eyes  ?
yes How many maniacs have shot places up this year?
no The time has come to end illegal immigration
no Marxist communists have no socialist agenda and sit on the left to destroy all progress including capitalism. When cities get old they destroy them from within to build elsewhere at the expense of the nation states they prosper from. Study history 100 million people died under communist leaders and the media commie owned will not report it.
yes My friend was stabbed 40 times the illegal was just deported to Mexico.  That was his punishment.  And you wonder why I fight for the wall?
yes sorry to know  of your Loss
yes There is no reason for any person to enter the USA illegally
yes Bring in more troops to battle the gun violence in schools!
yes Sorry for your loss...For evil to exist ... all it takes is for good men to do nothing.
yes But all who live in america are illegal immigrants except ppl who have indian roots
yes Raphael Pulman  This is very insightful about the European Union (EU) government.  """ Dear Mr. Temple, Thank you for your supportive email. The EU president was not elected into his post and is meant to be the face of 450 million people in Europe.  There is no mechanism to remove him and no way, through the ballot box, that the people of Europe can hold him to account.  The European Union is a undemocratic and corrupt organisation that tries to force us to accept one EU currency, one EU flag and one EU state without the consent of the people. It is my job to fight against this and be the voice of free speech - again thank you for your kind message. Yours sincerely, Nigel Farage" """
no It's sad that the world has changed so we need to build walls for our protection
yes Amen. To that
yes This only helps to spread fear and hate amoung ignorants.
no Valerie Siggson  yep because Trump cant be bought!!
yes What are you talking about Worley????
yes So sorry for your loss.  But thank you for telling Mandy's story and I pray that her story will keep others from the same fate as hers.  Build the wall! Trump 2020
no Love you Mr. President.
no Absolutely!
no AMEN-people just refuse to see the danger!!!!
yes Go Mr. President, go. You are the best. Dimitris from Greece/Hellas.
yes With all due respect...this could have been done by any us citizen.  Not just a  immigrant.      This happens all the time in the US by us citizens.   Alchoholism is a  horrid disease.    Guns kill at much higher rates  as Americans purposely murder at much higher rates.
yes Guns knife's and baseball bats work to
yes Okay but anyone could've drank a few and got drunk. Illegal or citizen of the u.s
yes how many americans kill eachother every day
yes Michael Curtin  hi
no We need President Piglosi's permission before we do anything now. This is so wrong
no Only COWARDS Veterans Supplemental Support Network use military signal device to overheat citizens phones like the ones at 1218 & 1086 Goa Way Road Hedgesville WV 25427
no Larry Martin nope.
yes From Quebec - Canada - You're Right Mr. President Trump - You're doing a great JOB at White House in all areas - Just Fake News and people as them don't agree.  Stay strong with all your near collaborators - You are FANTASTIC  WORKING in the right way tirelessly to get the BEST.  Thanking you to be there - Love - Support- Respect - Pride since Day 1.
yes Now tell me Aurora shooter was here legally? Slovenian I think so
yes Nora Arevalo    yep, just like in Israel, we will fill them up with cement.
yes #MAGAOTS
yes http://ourfilm.org/help
yes deplorable TrumpTurds > Ann Coulter: Trump Trying 'To Scam The Stupidest People In His Base
no Every single one of you people are of illegal ancestry. None of you are legitimate.
yes Every sanctuary city should be held accountable for these crimes. If it comes to light that an illegal was released instead of reported, then commits any crime, victims should be allowed to sue for damages.
no Priority as high as that dudes forehead HAHA!
yes Simon Kitson ... didn't donnie mention chain migration? Does he mean melanoma's parents?
no HELL YA MAGA 2020 , on cnn the other day they had a republican congressman and she was saying walls wont stop anything.   He said your absolutely correct BUT since we built barriers we used to have 150,000 crossings a year. Its down to 15,000...... so ya.... the dems are a joke...... Ill take 15,000 to 150,000......
yes We need to correct the narrative. It is not Trump's wall, it's America's. I believe Congress passed a motion to build a wall but just never got around to funding it.
yes Adam Somerville One angel family does not a crisis make!!!!  Trump declares national emergency...  Nobodys done the job that weve done on the border,  said Donny as he declares a national emergency today........the slowest emergency in history.  And with the lawsuits that will ensue, his wall will not be funded or built until after the next election...if ever.  THE WORLDS SLOWEST EMERGENCY!!!!!  Donny lied directly to Americans about his border crisis.  Our Liar-in-Chief said that all the data that refutes his crisis designation is lies.  Got that?  Our president told the American people that THE FACTS ARE LIES...this is what all wannabe dictators say.  This egomaniac is THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!  Donny doesnt seem terribly concerned about this crisis.  He plans to travel to Florida mere hours after declaring the emergency from the White House. A president, in times of strife, would typically stay in the nations capital to oversee the crisis. Donny plans to do so from the comfort of his weekend getaway.  In reality, Donny is preparing the country for a fake war as he plans to enjoy a mini vacation. The only national emergency in America right now is one of leadership!!
yes You know what would protect our families more than backward logic straight out of the 1st century? Healthcare for all, increased funding for schools, environmental protections, better wages. But you keep sticking to your regressive guns, champ
no An illegal immigrant committed a hit and run on my husband and I while we were riding our motorcycle.  We were left for dead in the middle of a road.  Yes, we need the wall.
no Dear God, please protect my family, my friends, this country from your lunatic followers. Amen. https://americasvoice.org/trumphatemap/
yes Do WE have LAWS.???  .......
no Why doesn't he report on the whites mass shooters?
no A madman killed 50+ people at a concert in Las Vegas  we must regulate firearms.  Or do we only use anecdote to make policy when it suits you ...
no Valerie how are you doing
no Sorry for his lost because we havent been protecting our borders correctly.
yes Keep them coming!
yes Scott Magers how have u been personally affectes by an illegal? just curious
no You're missing the point. Its called a deterent. It will make them have no choice but to use those methods and will likely be shot down or sunk if so.  Why do you have locks on your doors at home if someone can just ram a car through it or break in a window? Thats your logic
yes there should be a wall build around all europe to stop imigrants from north africa
no Stephen King they are trying
yes You missed the entire point of my post, Janie. Congratulations.   By your logic, everyone who dies by firearm wouldn't be dead if those were banned. Does that mean that we should ban firearms? No, it does not. Does that mean we should politicize gun deaths for the sake of taking gun rights away? No.   Please understand the complete hypocrisy before commenting again.
yes You been CHUMPED suckers  https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/average-tax-refunds-fall-fueling-discontent-with-gop-written-law?fbclid=IwAR2CctX_Dos3h7r6aS64kODkUYAv4hlJYNuLmU37nbGx_e6uHpCV_hVMicY&linkId=100000005061441&utm_campaign=newshour&utm_medium=pbsofficial&utm_source=facebook
yes The people who have had this happen should unite and sue the demon-rat-tick party.
no Kevin Llamas Jurez WOW really it amazes me how much stupid you can fit in your head.
no Build the Wall and let us keep America safe ...
no Tim Koepp  A wall wont fix it. Its a stupid idea
yes Really sorry for this persons loss but far more instances of mass shootings. A legal citizen killed groups of people in Vegas, Orlando, Parkland, Columbine, and San Bernardino.....Trumps not right and we need gun control.....so now what?
no Most of Orange Countys non illegal residents are for you president Trump. Newsom is NOT representing us! HELP
yes Adam Somerville yes, get trump out!!
yes Americans face consequences.  Illegals get deported and come right back. And....what about all the children that get trafficked through that border?  Oh I forgot, our country no longer cares about children
no How can you build a wall against gun massacre though idiot
yes Ps these shootings are from white American males. Let's put a wall around your butt
yes Not only complete it but install laws to prevent future issues and weedi g out the ones here uding and selling drugs. Guns. Or people.
yes An American white boy killed my brother, trump never brings that up does he?
no Such a high priority, in fact, that you waited two years to act and then went golfing right after you declared the emergency.
no What if we make being an illegal immigrant a capital offence? You have 30 days to buy a ticket and go home.
yes The same thing happened to me from a man that was a US Citizen and serving in the military. The point is these things happen and the people doing so will be legal and illegal at a proportion relative to their portion of the population. Just as my situation does not mean that men in the military are bad your situation does not mean illegals are bad........only that the individuals that perpetrated this on us were bad.
no Babi Nikki The reason black  people were brought here was black Muslims who captured and sold them to Dutch and Portuguese slave traders and brought them here to be sold to the American slave market. If you want to know where the origins are of your slave people look to your own black Muslims.
yes Man living in U.S. illegally sentenced for raping girl, 12, in Quarryville  https://lancasteronline.com/news/local/man-living-in-u-s-illegally-sentenced-for-raping-girl/article_71509adc-324a-11e9-8380-83210417fabc.html  (Via LNP | LancasterOnline)
no #buildthewall best President ever!
no It is so sad Democrats have become the Anti-American party.  They have abandoned the American people.
yes Hal Eric Mitlitsky Obama already did that with his pen and paper!!
no you must close the loopholes in the immigration laws now.. also we must have term limits and voter i.d asap!
yes CliffandKim Ferrell ....they are desperate! Trump is winning for America and they cant stand it! Their hate for him is greater than wanting to see America win! How sad is that?
no CliffandKim Ferrell ....52% approval!
yes Joseph Nowik they cant touch the 2nd amendment but nice try
no ASAP and on
no Let's get this done! Once and for all..
no Its your number one job as The President of the United States. And youre doing everything in your power to protect us. Not Mexico or any other part of  the world.  Now Democrats apparently work for everyone but Americans and the United States. Lol. They kinda need to. No one trusts them anymore
no Hey Dude.....Rebuild America's Middle Class......You're The Smartest Man that's Ever Lived......You Can Do It......!! You're a Big Boy.....!!!
yes How about, we regulate who is buying the firearm!!?? Makes more sense to me. Regulating the firearms, isn't going to solve the problem. Look at the UK, they took and regulated those guns, so evil is jumping into vehicles and running over people in mass numbers, folks are being stabbed with knives. Yeah, regulating firearms worked for them didnt it
yes Toni Saunders how are you
no God bless America and God bless president Trump.....the true American leader.....he loves our country.....
no Hello here
yes Lori Olson Rasmann American taxpayers have paid for border walls in 3 other countries. What you should be thinking is why the democrats dont want a wall. They dont want it not because it wont work but because it will, and they know it.
no Hayden Blair sueing is just going to tie up the funds I didn't say he wouldn't get the money. Moving the bases and starting training exercises would just be a cheaper  option that would get us a more effective boarder control almost immediately. He would still build the wall as funds became available  And would make the wall more secure even after it was built
yes Need build the wall...President Trump do the right thing...
yes They wasn't killers and murders when you hired them in Trump Towers.. you can't get what you want like a little boy you fallout because people don't play with you
no Seeking asylum is not illegal.
yes We support our President!  Build the wall!
yes No they dont, no it wont, and if you cared about the safety of American families youd be doing things that actually matter (like gun control)!
no Thank you, President Trump, For keeping  your Oath: The Oath, as stated in Article II, Section I, Clause 8 of the U.S. Constitution, is as follows: "I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
no Thank you
yes Tim Masters he didnt veto it.  Yesterday you said it shouldnt be an emergency order.  Now the government will spend millions more in court fights.
yes Build the wall!! I support President Trump. I want immigrants to come into our country legally after they have had sufficient background checks. I want a safer America for my children and grandchildren.
yes Dianna Adams Ewen  yes I have thank you
no Maria Nichols ....yawn.....
yes What a joke, the guy cant make a simple point about his country losing it's identity without it turning into a race issue.
yes the 2A was written to protect us from libtards...the side of castro, mao, lenin, stalin, che, infanticide, abortions, kkk robert byrd, kkk governor northam, margaret sanger, rapist impeached clinton, pedophile jailed anthony wiener, maduro,...just wish democrats would stop shooting up all these places, and more importantly stop turning all prosperous countries into killing fields..
yes Hey look, its racists who think all immigrants are murderers. Thats Trumps key demographic.
no God bless Trump!
yes #TrustthePlan #EVerify #VoterID
yes The 56 laughing at this, I right now am requesting a #PrayerAvalanche for you and now whatever comes, is on you... Maybe if you had had a different view on things, it may have been different. Thoughts be to you... 
yes Ed Wrany you mean best Idiot ever in this Planet.
yes Yes support the wall. Sorry for your loss.
yes Apple Rivera  GB was stable before joining the EU? You really are ignorant of fact. Unbelievable. Why comment on something you clearly have no knowledge of - you just make yourself look incredibly stupid.
yes Build The Wall!
yes All the mass shooters I know they were legal white people, but at court the judge said they were mentally unstable....
no Sad. But there are many more deaths from gun violence. When will you declare that a national emergency????
yes https://youtu.be/OYcpiokCRHo REVERSE WORLD MAP. BECAUSE: ROUND.
no they invade us....we invade them. let's see who's better at invasion.
yes Keith Webber Jr.; last post 2015. Comments are full of these revived, foreign, and newly created Facebook accounts to show support for propaganda and spread discord.
yes Mike LeJe some people misread the 2nd amendment. It says "to provide for a militia..." more people should study history to understand why that amendment is there.
yes Build it and make it so the Democratic nation cant take it down.
yes All you folks who say that walls don't work are either stupid or too blinded by liberalism to see past the end of your nose. If walls don't work then why are their walls around prisons, the vatican, military bases, the white house, rich people's estates , and countless other places where access is restricted?
no Why didn't you acknowledge the Parkland students on the anniversary of the shooting? That is a real crisis. You're full of crap.
yes George E Simpkins Jr  and just like Trumps point, it has nothing to do if the person who killed this guy daughter was illegal or not. Or his point is that if youre legal you have the right to kill?
yes trump should just send im thoughts and prayers-like he did the other day to the families of the victims of the Parkland shootings.
yes If the wall had built 20 years ago, how many people would still be living that were killed by illegal immigrants and chain migration people?  That would be an interesting number.
no Raja Ali none
no We have a fence to my backyard and someone went over it
no and Militarize it!
yes Build the wall !!!
yes David Thoreson because you had that vision right David ?
no So where were you when Obama was shoving his crappy health insurance down our throats?  Where were you when Obama was sending billions to our enemies in Muslim countries?  That idiot had so many executive orders it was mind blowing.  He thought he was God!!
no build the damn wall !!!!
no Thank you...President Trump!! Stay strong!! We love you Mr. President 45
no Andres Zapata sorry, you missed the point. 90% of all illegal narcotics come from you guessed it, The Honduras. across Mexico, over the border to mainstream America via. MS-13.  And no, everyone responsible for own decisions, just like my son. However, if there wasn't any available, No Addictions, and/or 300,000 deaths of overdoses! Got it?    #buildthewall #nationalemergency #stopthedrugs
no James Anderson If youre thinking that bump stocks and large magazines should not  be illegal, that the legal age for purchase should not be 21, and that we should not improve access to mental health programs then you support the perpetrators of these mass shootings that constitute a real national emergency.
yes Declares a national emergency. Flies to his resort and goes golfing. Suckers !!!
yes Good pick
no Illegal drugs killed my beautiful young grandson. One of 135 that day. Why would you resist a President that wants to spare us from all this? Pray it is never your child Liberal.
no How much are the cartels, coyotes, human traffickers, paying in brtibes to Democrats to keep to Border Open for them?  there is no other reason why Open Borders ....
yes I am an angel mom...my 20 year old son died from a fentanyl overdose in 2017...build the damn wall
no Jacqueline Alas exactly!
no Pretty please?  Japan?  Please??!!  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-wants-nobel-prize-795962/amp/
yes Despicable use of someones pain and loss for selfish reasons. Youre awful.
no I'm sorry for your loss. But then, how about white males shooting up schools and theaters? This is utter hypocrisy!
yes Dennis McCullar if lives is the criteria,  then gun violence and the opioid epidemic are greater emergencies.
no Maybe if some of these protestors could feel the pain and loss you have they would have a different opinion.  I pray God will comfort you and all the others who have suffered this great loss.
yes Timmy Macneil
no Patti Piccione Zambuto  Its not President Trump that is for murdering Babies, that is the Liberal Socialist Democrats.
no You people are really dumb
yes If you really cared about the lives of American families, you would declare a national emergency for gun reform since more lives are taken by guns, than illegal immigrants. Gun reform would be much more effective and cost less than your 8 billion dollar wall.
yes We have more HOMEGROWN terrorists...tRump's a bigly fool.
yes Americas in debt y'all,  why don't we use this money to pay back the Chinese instead or something more useful then a fucking wall 
yes That fucking forehead, Christ
no Build that wall ASAP
no So if a neighbor kills a bunch of kids in a school, or in a church or a music event, shouldnt we declare a national emergency and deal with the threat? Get real.
no Fake news
no Why it was built by the past Presidents?????  If that wall is not important let the Democrats to destroy it and make an open border to all !!!!!   That's what they want????  Funding to secure? / Wasting for protection?
yes DONT BE A SHEEPLE TO THE PRESIDENT, THINK FOR YOURSELF!!!!!!!
yes All the Dems care about is illegals, invaders and criminals
no If I read the case well, what caused her death was drunk driving, not illegal immigration
yes The driver was wrong but this is why you LOOK and pay attention when using a crosswalk. Just like you should never rely on the safety of a gun, you cant rely on people not to be idiots and blow through red lights. This is a drunk idiot problem, not an immigrant problem.
no Such a sad story but a wall is not going to stop the madness!
yes Eric Morrison blame the business who hired them
no To Angel mom's & families,  The world is watching  politicians devalue your existence,  that of your beautiful loved ones for self serving agenda.  Justice will come when these  politicians are removed.   Blessings for you're strength,  perseverance in the name of validating their lives, as worthy.    Thank you,  American Deplorables
no Bottom line we need wall
yes Linda Durbin   You mean working so hard on the golf course? You have to stop drinking the Kool-Aid. It has seriously affected your health.  Republicans think we hate Trump more than we love America.  The truth is, we hate Trump because we love America.
yes Mitch Haynie hey moron check the FACTS most illegals are visa over stayers that arrive on planes and boats not jumping over walls you fucking retard
yes They bring in fentanyl which killed my nephew.
no Even heaven has a wall and it's not an easy one to get into
no Yes sir that is sad about that girl that Nancy could care less about
yes Thank you for trying to keep us safe!!!!! Build the wall!!!!!
yes Sandy Seaney Mahady, make sure your relatives are not in schools where an active shooter might enter
yes Sharon Fantana there is no big tech equipment that is going to physically stop a vehicle from driving over the border in a place like Arizona. Also if they have to build tunnels to traffic this takes time and resources of the cartels. We've been building barriers under the last several presidents. The fact is some people just dont like Trump and use it as an excuse to oppose him but that does not change the fact of what works down here and unless you have been out in the field chasing this stuff you really can't understand how much it slows them down for us to get to these places especially the more remote ones.  As far as Mexico paying for it. Like I said we've been building barriers and paying for it under the last several presidents. Now I have not read the full new deal that replaced  NAFTA but from what I've seen, been told, and understand is that we're getting a huge swing of money our way essentially paying for the wall. He never said they were going to dish out cash. There are other ways to make them pay. IR tariffs, new deals in our favor etc. People tend to be too narrow minded to think about those things because the mainstream media just pushes what they want. That's why it's more important then ever to do your own research and find the facts not just what they want to tell you.
no And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me.             Thank you Jesus for Trump and Pence.
yes THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF RACE KILLERS EVERYWHERE WITH OR WITHOUT A WALL.
no These people...
yes How many shootings are done by American citizens yet you haven't passed many come sense gun laws!
no Ed Wrany Yes!
yes No, it is not possible.  You can see for yourself by looking back, trump's wall idea was never something the majority wanted.
yes How much more is spent on catch and release programs that the dems want to increase more per year than the wall would cost? How much more does it cost for jobs working off the books so taxes don't go where they should go, where the people working off the books get hurt and can't get medical? How much more does it cost for the gangs that, for me, is walking distance from my house, and all the harm they do every single day. There were over reported 1,000 crimes in the town that was my school district's town last year, about four reported crimes a day. On my way to work, depending on the time of day, there are about fifteen day laborers waiting for off the book work in an area, usually two or three groupings of men who are perfectly capable of work, which means they can't legally get work, which means they're criminals or not here legally. These are jobs that would pay better with benefits if it was done right. We need better policies for immigration control, and we need better ways for people to come here legally. In my eyes that means we need a wall with guards, but we also need more agencies out there to speed up the process needed for those who should be here legally to do so. We need what Ellis Island was, but in New York, California, and Texas, with branches set up in each state that reports back to those three places. We need an overhaul. We need a wall. We can fix things from there.
no The KKK kills people everyday.   Where's the wall

yes Sorry for your loss. #maga
no I've been on google maps and looking at the border. California has a really nice wall. SO they can have a wall, yet, they don't want anyone else to have one that needs one. There are already walls in a lot of places, but on google map, satellite view, you can see roads going to places that there are no walls... Walls aren't to keep people out, it tells them to use the door.
yes Sorry for your lost but the wall may not keep safe you and your family if you are at wrong time on the wrong place! Dont live your home ever!
no Daniel Alexander Allen this is the dumbest comparison on earth. Can't fix stupid is the real problem.

yes Stop their money & benefits too
yes I think the American people have a generous instinct. They understand that we're a nation of immigrants. But if those folks are going to live in this country, they have to be put on a pathway to citizenship that involves them paying a fine, making sure that they are at the back of the line and not cutting in front of people who applied legally to come into the country.
yes liberals only care about illegals, votes and power, not american lives

yes STEVEN MILLER on Fox News. Rhino Neo Con Chris Wallace trying to get him  to made a mistake. Wallace arrogantly trying to trip  him up. MILLER was magnificent. KNEW the Law.  If Miller had been sent to negotiate  a spending bill instead of Democrat Jared Kushner., Rhino Lindsey Graham and Mike Pence...TRUMP WOULD HAVE THE MONEY... Before 2020, someone needs to do an intervention and get Kushner Out of the White House. Ambassador to Israel? Tune out Graham. Not his friend.
no Tell it to the world. They are just selfishly trying to get voters for the next election. It's all about power. The don't care about  your love ones, America or Americans. Yell from the roof tops and we'll yell with you! The old ones need hearing aids, the young are tone deaf so get loud and make sure the hear you.

no So sorry for the tragic loss of your daughter. I believe President Trump will protect our country like no other.  May your daughters death and all others not be in vain.
yes If your thinking they should take guns away that would just make matters worse. Look at Chicago as that example.
no Robert Duncan I'll try.
yes Linda Durbin if youre a multimillionaire, hes working for you. Check your bank account, you may have been duped.
yes Larry Fields and the sad part is the left sees nothing wrong with this. And you are exactly right!!
no Why isnt mexico paying for it?  damn yall dumb
yes Ryan, you're a special kind of STUPID! !!!!!!
yes A wall will not make us safer #Dotard! Ever hear of ladders? Tunnels? How about simply cutting through the prototype steel that you're thinking of using?
yes So mr. Krabs you can't make money off everything through contracts and contractors that build the wall after your fake presidencies up .
no Thank you President Donald J. Trump.. after you announced the wall being built a heavy monkey off our backs..
no An illegal killed my dad years ago..

yes Mystique, What is your point?  other than we have ENOUGH Legal criminals so why are we IMPORTING them?????
yes Trump loves the poorly educated   https://www.facebook.com/mark.steward.1654/videos/1070211679808070/
yes Trump and his base of believers are like a cult. He claims his wall is already being built, when the truth is not 1 inch of his wall has been built yet. And his followers eat it up. A lot of Kool-Aid is being consumed! Lol
no John Jacob google trump Epstein Clinton. They are pals
no The first step is to recognize the problem, make a decision, and move it forward
no "Safe again"? So there was a wall before?
yes Simon Cardinal those are all problems we have to worry about, of course. There's no debate here. the point here is that the wall has nothing to do with the fact that somebody has been killed. the point is that trump is using a specific situation that has nothing extraordinary to prove his point on a global issue. You cant build a point on such an important issue by playing with peoples sentiments using tragedies. En fait c'est simplement de la malhonntet intlectuelle et cela est une preuve parmis tant d'autre que cet homme exploite les sentiments, les motions et des stratgies trompeuses dans ses discours afin de contourner toute rflexion rationnelle puisque c'est un terrain o il s'est avr tre incapable de gagner.
no All u dumb asses that dont think we need a wall. What if it was your family member
yes Adam Somerville Amen

no Respect from the U.K.  build the wall. MAGA
yes So sorry for your loss. My heart is very sad for all the Angel Parents caused by Devils here Dems gladly let in!
yes I wonder about the mental faculties of people who buy into Donalds propaganda messaging of hate and intolerance. The same people who feel the need to place blame in the case of unfortunate accidents. Small minded individuals who cant reason past the end of their noses. The same breed of people as the petty, vindictive moron child in the White House.
no Build it
yes Adopt the Texas law! Execute murderers regardless of citizenship.
yes Hal Eric Mitlitsky why wouldn't a wall work??? i want to hear your thought
yes The wall is pointless. They will still get through and trump is making it seem like immigrants are the main problem committing crimes etc when it's our own American people!
yes Trump!Trump!!Trump!!!
yes Shits beyond stupid. Let's just pull out of other countries and go to war with south America. This post is wack.
yes But how did this illegal get in? From Mexico? From the airport? Oversea?
yes Its time the US Government gets sued for tortious negligence for breach of duty in protecting our citizens.  This will put an end to the Liberal open boarders agenda, real quick.
no Maureen Hersey Brown becaus theyre braindead sheep!  They believe what the evil scum tells them!
yes Mr President have you heard of Tunnels.
yes Walls work very well in Israel to solve many border problems.  We can take a page out of their playbook.  Only millions of dollars to do about 500 miles, not billions.
no QUIT THE FEAR MONGERING..!!!!
yes ..Thousands and thousands of innocent people are murdered every year by "home grown" American murderers.....How come they`re NOT paraded before the public like this one committed by an illegal....??..I guess if you`re killed by an American it dosen`t matter because it dosen`t fit in with Trump`s BULLSHIT about his wall....
yes The wall needs to be built for American Security. President Trump is aware of all the violence in the border towns.
yes So sad....the left thinks voters are more important than the security of our own people.....4,001 killed in two years by illegal immigrants.....in Phoenix we have 7.5% illegal immigrants.....50% of all class one felonies are caused by the 7.5% of the population.....33% of all drug arrests are for the 7.5% of the population.... 74% of the 7.5% are on benefits for life...at least since the 1986 Immigration Reform Act.....
yes What happens if Mexico decides to build a big staircase on there side of the wall ?
yes What about people killed by police officers. Should we build a wall around police officers?
yes Craig J Grove I can't wait ! Locked and loaded
no In Chicago every 14 mins somebody is getting shot. The man who created the massacre in Las Vegas? All these shooters are "legal Americans"
yes Crazy people kill innocent Americans, I support gun control 100%, nobody with mental illness history should own a gun.
yes Send all illegal aliens back and their anchor babies
yes Renieri Ortiz immigrant does not mean illegal  !!!!

no How many legal citizens kill people in the United states daily?
yes Build the wall Build the wall Build the wall

no Dave Callender   Regardles of any crimes commitef by them after they get here,It is illegal  to sneak into the country,. When an american citizens break any laws we are held accountable.  They shouldn't be an exception. They  are criminals because they brpke  the law.

no Betty Bilbrey "The only national emergency is that our president is an idiot"  Ann Coulter
no Christopher Curry  According to the Democrats,  came through the port of entry and put his name on the list so they can keep account  (statistics), they talk about them all the time !
yes Enough is Enough!!!!! Prayers....Get this wall up!
yes We can't build the wall with our tax money because that's socialism! Let's make Amazon or Walmart or one of the big oil companies build it... about time they pay us back for all the subsidies they get.
no Linda Durbin working?  Building a wall is not much of a work if you might ask......
yes Crystal Maskell Carey what part of well regulated militia do you not understand?
no Still so many brainwashed programmed sheep
yes Wake up Democrats
no So sorry you lost your Daughter. I know Donald Trump is working hard to keep us safe  so many is trying their best to stop him.
yes A far greater problem killed over 70,000 last year...but it's Big Pharma getting rich, so trump keeps hands off. https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/5/18207386/trump-opioid-epidemic-state-of-the-union-2019
no Absolutely  If we don't have the funds to build the wall along our own southern border  Then stop sending American tax-payer funded financial aid to foreign countries, stop financial aid to illegal aliens, stop importing cheap labor, stop allowing and enabling US jobs and industries to be outsourced to foreign countries and do not import foreign fuel, steel nor electronics used in our military weapons, national defense systems and power grids  Build the wall and guard the border using our drone and satellite surveillance systems to find and turn back unauthorized intruders  Also, hire our veterans and former law enforcement officers to monitor and minimize visa over stays.  This is The United States of America, it's our country and being a US Citizen is absolutely relevant  What the American People clearly want and need are more elected officials that will actually start putting the best interests of our own US CITIZENS first and foremost, and that includes appointing judges and others that will do the same.  For the first time in 30 years, we finally have a president that's actually doing something about our traitorous trade and immigration policies  And the corrupt manipulative media, establishment puppet politicians and their globalist masters are blatantly fighting President Trump and the American People tooth and nail every step of the way.
yes BUILD THE WALL AND MAKE THEM GO THROUGH THE LEGAL CHANNELS TO COME TO THE US.
yes Chump you should show the crimes against immigrants there will be at least twice as many. You should be ashamed of yourself for politicizing tragic deaths to push your sick agenda.
no 100%
yes Protection and Defense. What more are the Feds good for?????

no Your all strong than me some hurts one of my children or a family member I wont stop I'd destroy everyone of there family and them
yes Build the Wall.
yes Why do people not want to be protected? Do you allow anyone off the street into your home without first knowing who they are? Of course not. Our country is no different. Can you go to any country you choose illegally and remain there illegally, taking federal aid, get a job, etc., with no paperwork? No! Why should America be any different? Come legally or dont come. My ancestors all came here LEGALLY.  Immigrants are wonderful and add to this country, but come legally as countless others have. Can we, as Americans, break the law without expecting consequence? No! Why should anyone coming to this land illegally be allowed to break the law of the land without consequence? Its just not that difficult to understand!
no its a globalist scam... allies wanting to defend each other shouldn't need to be coerced into doing so... either yah wanna help your homie ..or not
no People die from these types of accidents all the time. But when they're American they usually blame it on the alcohol the difference is agenda...

yes So because most shooters are male and white - all white men on round the clock surveillance and barred from ownig weapons then? A white man strangled his whole family here in Colorado and theres much more problem with American terrorists then illegal ones.
no Charlesetta Brown um...walked
yes Kevin McGrath   Are you still in Canada or Kansas?  Dont expect to see any walls there.
no I think anyone that dont support border security or that thinks its just not important is no different than the problem itself, anyone that wants to argue with facts that family members have been lost because of it are just idiotic  because they havent lost their family because of it so they wont know how it feels
no and Hamburgers are made by germans
yes Drunk drivers come from all walks of life. I'm sorry for the family. But it seems like alcoholism is the root cause of the epidemic that caused this death and thousands of others.

no How many immigrants desecrate American families by  committing these mass murders!
yes Behind you 100%!!!
yes The reason liberals and some so called republicans are so mad is because up until now every president since Reagan has given just enough money for a small section of wall to keep enough voters happy to keep getting re-elected. The liberals dont want the wall because it will keep their base from growing and ruin their idea of a world without borders. The republicans are afraid they are gonna upset the moderates and independents. We finally have a president that is serious about securing our country.
no Complete the wall
yes ORourke, a Democratic former Texas congressman and candidate for Senate, responded in an interview with MSNBCs Chris Hayes Thursday to a question tweeted by Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas), who asked whether ORourke would make the citys border wall disappear if he could.  Absolutely, ORourke said without hesitation.  Id take the wall down, ORourke said, adding that the barrier has not in any demonstrable way made us safer.  ORourke said the existing wall has pushed migrants and asylum seekers and refugees to the most inhospitable, the most hostile stretches of the U.S.-Mexico border ensuring their suffering and death.
no FAKE STORY ALERTS I jus don't believe there is truth in a lot of these stories with fake pages.  I think some of y'all jus giving fake testimonies to help campaign for TRUMP and trying to see who can come up with the best sob stories.  Republicans geeeesh!!!!

I am sorry for your loss, but blanket statements that equate an isolated incident to mass murder is ludicrous. Immigrants are not killing us, our own citizens are.

Same day he declares a FALSE National Emergency on the border our REAL NATIONAL EMERGENCY REARS ITS DEADLY HEAD AGAIN WITH 5 DEAD, 5 POLICE INJURED AS WELL AS OTHER INNOCENT VICTIMS.

There is NO difference between Angel Moms or any other family who has suffered this unimaginable loss by gun violence in our country by our own American citizens... DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT CONGRESS AND TRUMP...DO IT NOW!!! IT IS OVERDUE.

no Yes people we have several problems in this country mass shootings drugs illegal aliens and so on so forth.  We now have a president who is picking a problem and doing something about it.  Then we can move on to the next thing.   It may not be the fix all but even if it only keeps out half the drugs and illegal's that's a huge victory. Build to wall.

no Like if immigrants are the only people in the world that kill people.  So much hate on the heart of this fake presidents.  White people kill more people than anyone in the entire history,  but wait that's "fake news " uh?
yes We also should not give any illegal immigrant any kind of benefits or welfare I think this would turn away a lot of them from coming into the United States.
yes Trump. Dude. You have been eating up the fake news for years now. Stop it already. Please. Resign. You are not qualified to handle this job. You are screwing up America.
yes Charlesetta Brown they are more than welcome IF they come in legally.  The problem is, the ones that don't come legally.  They have no right to be here period.
yes Kimberly Mansfield  yep by crazy people that have mental health issues!! If their parents lost control what the hell can President Trump do? Most murders are from illegal guns the wall will cut down on that too! People with guns need to lock them up better! Not a lot can be done about crazy people!!
no Anecdotes do not constitute statistical data. One, a hundred, or even a thousand do not represent a whole group.
yes BUILD THE MOTHER FUCKING WALL
yes I love that Donald J. Trump is working to protect Americans and he is acknowledging these angel parents to help them heal.  May their children's deaths not be in vain.
yes Sorry .. for you lost .. RID .. in peace. ...  I lost my sister 2..  an that not make me a racial...
yes Debbie Bauman close to my daughter's age. Do you track him still? What he'd be doing ? That sort of thing. He'd be 32 now? I'm sorry. He was old enough to know him as a man and the person he was becoming. Every year is a gift.
yes He's so big on immigration reform yet he employs  so many illegal immigrants and married one then had her parents come over here think about
yes Keep doing what you are doing
yes Wow, Jeffrey Dahmer, Charles Manson, Ted Bundy, thousands of American killers and donny plump is exploiting these families for his own twisted agenda. Did Mexico's check not clear? Over 7,000 lies told since taking office. IMPEACH now!
no Shooting? Lol damn Trumpbots
no We have enough problems with our own criminals! We don't need illegal criminals to compound the problem
yes Yeah liberal morons have been saying if gun control saves one life its worth it, but guess where most of the "gun violence" occures. Gun free zones and cities with higher gun laws. Yup how's that working for you libtards.
no Definitely yes thank you President Trump
yes Protection for American families? Then does this mean you will ban assault weapons?
yes Then why did you sign the funding bill that actively goes against your own goals?
yes HELLO.......they comes here for FREE (which we pay for) perks.  Stop all the freebies and they will quit coming right away.  Charge a hefty fee for sending money to a foreign country and walla, that will stop or slow down too.  And, lastly but not leastly, reduce or stop foreign aid all together.
yes Mr trump im so proud of the work u are doing.ive never seen any eather.prisdent like u mr trump.u have my support
no Abrams Patricia am interested
no John N Karen Morris  Thank you! I have saved the numbers you provide and put them on speed dial.

no Voter ID before 2020!
no I'm so sorry to all who have lost a family member because of an illegal!!  We need the WALL!!!
no What about the school kids who slaughtered in school every year by Americans?
yes There should be no question on this wall.  We need to protect Americans.  Sorry for your tragic loss .. if the wall can help prevent one tragedy like this.   Well worth it.    Lets all fight with our President to get it done.  Build the wall.
yes Marilyn didn't call anyone a name. Your case is pointless.
yes These posts are old
yes Build that wall Mr. President I completely agree with you and support the idea of protecting our country. Im firmly in support.
no That means your stupid ass has to go too, you don't like it here then leave
no Donald J. Trump so my question to you Mr. President is why so much concentration on our southern border . I understand yes drugs do come from there but also what about by planes ,boats etc. Why aren't we focusing on other countries such as Russia,Columbia parts of Canada that supply cocaine ,herion and whatever else come from those countries?
yes Its not about the wall, its about that the bill provides amnesty for illegals, limits ICE and hampers our ability to throw the illegals out. I don't know why in gods name he signed that damn thing. Not to mention once again provides an unchecked slush fund to isreal
no President Trump, you forgot to finish your sentence because of the interruptions at the press conference, You didn't have to do this..... but you had to because Congress would not do their job to protect the American People.
no Yes!
no More legal citizens kill more people are you fkng kidding me. So idiotic.
yes Only fools think Walls dont work!  WALLS WORKED!  Look  around your house  and see what Walls do for you and your family!  If walls dont do anything for you, Tear those walls down!  Its simple as that!!! A message from a lowly lowly Master Sergeant (Ret),  USAF from San Joaquin Valley, California, a Ground Zero for Armed Criminal Illegal Aliens because of Sanctuary State Policy benefiting Illegals enacted by Corrupt, Greedy, Heartless, Lobbyists (Bribes) Loving Cynical Democrat Politicians led by Wicked Nightmares Creator and Anti-Border Security Speaker Nancy Pelosi!  #45MAGABUILDTHESOUTHERNBORDERWALLS
yes Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
yes Barbara leonetti please can I by your friend
yes Five Americans were killed yesterday by American citizens though
no What about those killed by the negligence of the opioid industry!? You accept Sackler donations don't you!?
yes Sharon Fantana
no Build the wall....!!!!!!!!!!
yes Easy answer..trumpers..
yes Jim Popper it's not fear mongering.....its common sense, but what do libtards know about that??
yes You yourself said, in Fridays Rose Garden announcement, that you did not need to do this now.  Of course, you wont play that part for your blind followers - gotta manage their perception of dear leader!!!  How can it be an emergency if you did not need to do it now and as you said, it could be done over several years?  You are one terrible leader.
yes sorry to say the wall will slow them down but not stop them.
no Why do all the liberals like Pelosi, Schumer have armed security, walls, home security systems to protect themselves, if they dont want a wall to protect American citizens?
yes https://boston.cbslocal.com/2019/02/07/access-to-guns-not-mental-health-responsible-gun-violence/
no Not trying to be rude but Americans do that all the time either drinking and driving or texting and driving causes accidents
no Kenny Shuster get your head out of your ass we need the wall
no American killed 2 of my nephews 3 decades ago.
yes God bless you, President Trump.
yes When do we declare gun violence a national emergency ?
no Demand your da to prosecute governor mayor even senators who allowed the murder to be here there are laws against aiding and abetting also go after aclu
yes America deserve your services, please can you come over to Africa and change it completely different?
yes It's unfortunate that she's dead nit antidotal evidence, stories, have no place in policy decisions.
yes Do their lives matter more than the multiple children killed each year in mass school shootings?
yes Veronica Torres are toy even paying attention to hope much money the trump family is making off this presidency...I do respect your opinion but facts are facts
yes Don't trust turtle head, read everything.
yes Build the wall now!
yes Alberto Weisz And use other means?
no You the man President Trump
yes Craig Shurick , you really think 90% of illegals came through a checkpoint? If so, you are very misinformed.
no TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP
yes Steven Chen
yes President Donald J. Trump thank you for trying to save America from the drugs and the invasion. as a life time Democrat i salute you for fighting for us
yes Steve M Souza What happens when its not finished by the time hes out of office. Im sure you have an answer for that too. Even if he were to be re-elected, it wont be finished. There are literally mountains, rivers, and private property to contend with. Think about how long lawsuits will be drawn out.
yes BUILD THE WALL #TRUMP2020MAGA
yes :-)
no Joseph Tewell so how's your tax dollars that are being sent to Jordan to build THEIR wall helping you?
yes Kelly Anders wow, really?  50% of violent crime in America is committed by 13% of the population and they ain't white.
no Art Jackson Unless your numbers include the hundreds of millions of disarmed people that have been killed by their communist/socialist governements then you are pissing up a rope. But, by all means. Convince me.
no So sorry for ur loss
no OUR president has sent a solid and straight forward messege too not only the leftist in our country with yesterdays decision too declare a national emergency but he is making it clear to any tin pot dictators too boot on a few more levels of greater importance.....Give em hell Mr.President.....!!!
no Robert Cee wow you must be living in the twilight zone.  Here in the USA the urban dwellers are the takers.  They will not speak for the rest of the country nor should they.  People in big cities are ignorant of life outside of their little bubbles and can't think or do things for themselves.  Amazon just got run out of New York because of socialist A-holes who live in a fantasy world of progressive idiocy.
yes Curtis Rice inbreeding
yes YES AND WE NEED TO DO IT NOW. CONGRESS NEEDS TO QUIT ACTING LIKE A BUNCH OF JUVENILES.
no Damn right!
yes U BETCHA
no Diana Klausner ...I agree with you but honestly believe they are helping our cause in 2020...making it much easier for Trump to be re elected because a lot of people are seeing that party for what they truelly are.
no Sandy Theriault , lol building a wall to protect US citizens doesn't violate our rights. Do you really think people will just do nothing if they try to take away our right to bear arms. There wil be civil war if that happens. And I'm guessing the side with weapons will probably win.
no Why don't democrats what the wall? We all know walls work, not to mention, the same democrats that are against the wall today are the same democrats that signed off on a wall for the last 30 years. Pelosi, Schumar, all of them.. So what changed? The Bills were always signed and granted billions of dollars, Why are they against the wall now? But were for it in the past?
no Laura-Renee Mendoza
no Yeaaaa
yes He lost his home but he paid his worker and his venders because he was old school .  He told to file for bankruptcy too but his love for country and family did not let him do that . Now he is a broken man just because he believed in you . Are country is head in the same direction AMERICA awake up , this guy is no business man he is a CONMAN
no Bill Johnson are you less safe than 20 yrs ago?NOPE!!!!!!!!
yes Saves lives of border patrol too. They have family.
yes Maybe they should have built a wall around the Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora!  Of course that was an American male with a previous aggregative assault conviction who had a gun and killed 5 and wounded at least 5 others!! But dont worry about gun control, just build walls!!
no Build the wall Congress will never get it. Thank You President Trump for thinking of America first you got my vote in 2020 just like you did in 2016. Thanks for keeping you promise of putting America first. #MAGA
no There is a 10yr old an hour from here that would like to give her opinion but she can't. She was picked up at church and then raped, killed and her body stuffed down a well. The person who did it had been deported multiple times with an assault record.  Can you imagine how hard she was screaming and crying as she was being raped and then being silenced as she was murdered in cold blood. This was preventable. Now tell me how this was not preventable? She was only ten. She had her own dreams.
yes Is this a Russian post?
yes Carl Mrner Trumpcucks get hard off of dead kids.
yes Well what about the HOME GROWN white men's killing people in churches, in school's,  in outdoor  concert,running people down with cars,random shooting, no immigrant did this, nobody talks about this, and that includes trump. I guess we need a wall within states where all the violence  is going on.  Kids can't go to school,without fear of being murdered, you  can't go to church without fear of someone might come in and shoot you. We  desperately need gun control. You can't ignore facts, trump  haven't spoke out about this issue  Yet.
yes Julie your not really clear what your trying to say.
no Dee Dee Kelly Colvin never said it was did I!
yes Build the wall the government has money for whatever else they want
no What about the thousands killed in mass murders by white American citizens
yes Amen!!!!
yes Humpty Trumpty promised a big wall, Humpty Trumpty said Mexico will pay for it all, But all of the 'King's' horseshit  and all of Fox News spin, couldn't hide that Humpty Trumpty was lying again!
no Daniel Alexander Allen these people don't understand logic you're wasting your breathe
yes "I'm declaring a national emergency."  "I could do the walk over a longer period of time, I didn't need to do this."  - Donald Trump 
yes The President has a Constitutional right to protect Americans... The court and lawsuit theatrics is such a waste,  and quite frankly,  Stupid!
no Ron Gagnon, yes 45, keep draining the swamp of that crap you keep filling it with. You know all the best swamp people. What a joke.
no #BUILDTHEWALL #PRESIDENTTRUMP use El Chapos seized money #THANKSELCHAPO
no I am saddened to hear of your daughter's death, I am equally saddened to hear about the death of the 5 innocent victims in Illinois, and the 6 wounded, how are we going to deal with that
yes Build the wall!! This is the ONE President who will GET IT DONE!!
yes President Trump you need to stop the slaughter of babies. You also need to help our children dyeing from vacines. States are taking med and religious exemptions away.
yes We need something!! Build wall.......  Unless someone has a better idea..  Has nothing to do as to if you like Trump or not.. We need wall
yes Yes we need that wall now
no So this illegal immigrant was arrested in 2017? Wouldnt it have been better to focus on locking him up instead of locking up the kids in camps? Im just a simple mind but it seems obvious that this is who should be locked up and not the children. Anyway, what do I know... I will still vote 2020. Btw, is it true with the national emergency I can also vote for him in 2024?
no Illegals coming into our country that add no value to our system, they suck us dry, take all the freebies they can and bring violence, drugs and gangs into our communities. Build the wall!!!
no A disgruntled worker killed 6 people.  The problem is very simple even the dumb base can undersetand. Too many guns!  Now thats an emergency.     Fore! https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2019/02/17/us/aurora-shooting-termination/index.html
no Timothy Kershner Send him back. He is here ILLEGALLY. Come back the legal way!!!!
no https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=617326192030358&id=100012589481145
yes ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE IN 4 WINDS CASINO I SEE THEM WHEN I GO THERE NON USE THERE PLAYER'S CARD  INSERT INTO SLOTS ...
yes What about gun laws asshole
no My father was killed in Mesa AZ hit and run long story short they told me the driver probably went back to Mexico and that's why they couldn't find him !!! I'm glad the wall is being built God speed Patriots
yes We must revise Immigration Laws, and enforce them. If you violate immigration Law you lose eligibility forever!
no Peter Fell lol. You poor man. You don't even know what day it is. You do know that believing a lie brings on a reprobate mind that's mental illness. Not knowing a lie from truth or right from wrong.
yes I agree with you.  I am so sorry about your loss of Mandy.   Please know there are many who are trying hard to get the facts out but it is difficult.  I do believe we will have a wall eventually.  Don't give up and all the best to you and your family!
yes Mr. Trump, illegal immigrants do not come just in southern border. I agree with the wall, but I hope you can solve the people who came here via tourist visa and overstay here.
yes An American with a Bump Stock killed 58 other Americans in Las Vegas.  Would a wall have stopped THAT???
yes Terry Smith amen brother
yes Melissa Corrente. Yoohoo
yes The Court: The President said he didnt need to declare an emergency, did he not?  Counsel: Correct.  The Court: And that he just did so because he wanted it done faster?  Counsel: Yes, your honor.  The Court: How on earth is that an emergency?  Counsel: Hasnt your time expired?
no Thank you President Trump!!!!! Please keep us safe:)
yes Was that an illegal immigrant that gunned down five coworkers and wounded five police the other day? The REAL emergency in the United States - gun violence.
no How many people were killed in las vegas or parkland or aura trump you don't care.
no Joseph Nowik its not an overreach. Since the 1970s therr has been nearly 40 national emergencies declared. Its only because it Trump the snowflakes are crying.
no Im with you brother I lost a daughter also not with an illegal but I know how you feel
yes FAKE CRISIS, FAKE PRESIDENT!
no Its evil, what is going on out here. And its getting worse. Mr. President.
yes How dare you use someones sorrow to promote your imaginary emergency. You have nor morals.
yes Rosemarie Cwiertniewicz; last post 10/17. Comments are full of these revived, foreign, & newly created Facebook accounts to show support for propaganda and spread discord.
yes People will come into open doors of your house. Leave your house and open the doors and you will see with open doors people just walk in.
no MaLinda Venatta you lying liar.
yes whats that have to do with an illegal with no license or insurance...etc...if he weren't  here, it never would have happened
yes Bob Cunha name a wall that has worked?  Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR
no Don't pretend you care then support abortion
yes Eff off.  So sick of your treasonous a$$ abusing your powerpower that never should have been placed in your incompetent, tiny hands, with your petty, tiny brain, in the first place.
yes Vote for ALL RED! Stop the killings!  Build that WALL!
yes If we could get every angle family affected in this way to March onto  capital hill
yes Dee Dee Kelly Colvin its sad that there are SO many illegals here
yes Jacqueline Alas laws against murder already on the books and enforced. We are demanding the remainder of our laws are enforced. What is so controversial about that? Why is that so difficult to comprehend.
no Protect your people. Stop the nonsense
yes But the fascist democrats need their human livestock from Central America
no Prayers
yes Sandy Masi
no Stu Brierley Hey brit! Men like this saved your worthless ass in WW2!
yes Amate la vostra Patria perche' se lascerete entrare i Gog e Magog dal Sud America la vostra comicita' si trasforma in dolore. W Mister Trump il Patriota.
no John Burks , better phrased as thats why prisons still have prisoners in them. There are plenty of drugs and weapons in every prison.
no 95% of these comments are bots, lmao.   Have fun the rest of yall.
yes Too many Americans are killed in mass shootings by US Citizens!!!! We need a national emergency to ban guns!! That would be much more effective in saving lives!
yes Because walls work
yes Yes Sir,walls work very well. How effective would a prison be at keeping inmates in without their walls/fences? And walls are absolutely Biblical too.
yes Mark Smart that's not how that works.  A company leased a truck from enterprise, a rental company.  The rental company has no liability of their vehicle in the possession of a subcontractor. Unless it was negligent maintenance that caused the wreck.
yes Hal Eric Mitlitsky you lefties keep regurgitating that mantra about gun control. So stupid, its in the constitution. Also did any of you lunatic leftwings know that Obama already did it 12 times in his Presidency? Btw, we dont give a rats @$$ what  names you whiney sore losers call us. We have names for you too.The dems have to bring in outsiders because the American citizens see they are not for the betterment of this country. Patti Cullen, try telling that to Ms. Pukelosi or the 12 times Obama did it.
yes Alberto Weisz says the foriegn ass piece of dog shit
yes Shame your daughter died. Just glad the wall is getting built
yes Singling out people? What about all the mass shootings in our own country?Americans shooting Americans?Highest in he free world. Gun control? The emergency appears to be your mind?
no Patty Bertocchini La Puma I do care but those stats are not accurate killed is killed not by a human hand
yes Art Gnuvo have you check the new trade agreement with Mexico?  Surely you didnt think Mexico was going to write a check
yes So it is a competition?! One is not as bad as the other?! It matters when some son-of-a-bitch guns you down?! What an asshat! What part of ILLEGAL ALIEN border jumper, who is not supposed to be here to begin with, do you not get?! As in if the illegals were not here at all, they could not kill anyone AT ALL! you mental midget!
yes Painful as it is , this type of situation repeats itself but in different scenarios. But a wall wont solve the presidents ego. Next itll be a some other promise he made to impress the masses holding someone else accountable. Mexico was going to pay for the wall he said . He knew that was a farce . When Irak was invaded , it was because of weapons of mass destruction which were never found to this date . Do not become part of the play because of your loss . Trump is disrespectful of your pain in doing this . Do not let them use you.
yes I pray that the democrats will see the need and help.
no Karen Dearham Grimaldi i just left LA 1 year ago. in 5 years I live in LA, the hispanic popular boomed exponentially. you won't believe it till you actually experienced that. they aren't even scared anymore that they are illegal. they think they are allowed to do that. everywhere in california. they only go into hiding when you call them out, then they will go back when people forget about the problem. right now there are a lot of them at the US border just waiting for us to rest a bit so they will continue. do you even know that hispanic population is now 50% of california? in just less than a decade? how? if not from illegal immigration?
no #MAGA!  #BUILDTHEWALLCRIMEWILLFALL!
no Saschas Page
no Yeah, Angel Precious .  $22tn deficit the highest ever. He really cares about himself!
yes The Congress wastes more in an hour than a wall the entire length of the border with Mexico would cost.   With a multi trillion dollar budget the 6 billion that Trump wants for a wall is a rounding error.
no Tommy Carpenter yea Tommy I know. I was what you might call being sarcastic
no Thank You Mr. President. The only one who truly cares about us.
no He would have liked the idea .
yes But it will be much,much harder.Every country who has a wall say their illegal's have dropped from 50-95% success rate.Israel is at 99%.He is on the front lines we just have news to go by,and some choose to listen and salivate to fake news..And those who believe in God and his word the bible,it's in many a scripture.
yes Nancy Pelosi and Democrats have not negotiated in good faith to fund a wall at our Southern Border, proving that obstruction is far more important to them than YOUR SAFETY.  Last week, more than 95% of the Patriots I polled demanded a wall. Thats because WALLS WORK! I was just in the great city of El Paso, Texas, where illegal traffic has dropped over 90% because of their beautiful wall.  I cannot allow Americas safety and security to be put at risk any longer. We need the wall, and I must put AMERICA FIRST!  Nancy and Democrats have said they will consider filing a legal challenge to ensure the wall is never built, as they continue putting illegal immigrants before Americans. So, we need you to make a HUGE statement to them right now.  Im setting a goal of raising $2,OOO,OOO. I know a goal this big is unprecedented, but we need the American people to make a powerful statement to these Democrats to FINISH THE WALL.  https://donate.donaldjtrump.com/finish-the-wall?amount=42&DCPe=ZGpzYWdlQG1zbi5jb20&utm_medium=email&utm_source=ET_16&utm_campaign=20190217_9282_finish-the-wall_donaldjtrump_tmagac&utm_content=gop_direct-ask_text_contribute_top_42_dn
yes I'm disabled from a stroke from a head on collision with a drunk illegal, there was no shoulder either yet a big ditch I thought he was passing till it was too late he wasn't supposed to pass on a solid line anyways but it happens so that's what I was figuring
no Hmmm. I know that is sad but there are more family members who lost loved ones inmass shootings by white American males.
no To tell the whole truth, the 1.4 million you mention, 98% are from cop self defense, suicide and good Samaritans saving theirs and others lives. Yep, 2% are all that can be called problem killings by criminals. Ask how many gun deaths France and Britain have. It 8lis far higher because only bad guys have guns.   The bottom line is you do not trust your fellow Americans to have the same power as everyone else. U want to disarm us, so you can control us. This is not your fault. Liberals teach this because they are also afraid. I am sorry you have to spend your life cowering in fear. I am sorry you believe Pelosi and Clinton who are protected by armed guards everywhere they go. What's good for them, you do not deserve because u are their subjects.
no This is most definitely why we need a wall. This is a sad story.
yes May God Comfort you.
yes Anthony Clark because flint michigan is a state issue, not a national issue, or a national emergency. Do you understand the meaning of national emergency? Fix your own water issues, hire competent people to run your water plants.
no Thanks you trump for the wall and safety of the American people.
yes Joseph Roy start with Americans first tho. That's where Trump should start
yes Mr. President, thank you for fighting FOR AMERICA!
yes Jack Goldman    Youre an Idiot, Jack.
no Build.the.wall  Make America.safe
no Very good good talk
no Tyler Rogozinski except you neglect consumer and investor confidence with has an immediate effect.  Obama did everything he could to stop any growth and told people straight up "1-2% is the new normal, get use to it."  Trump says "4% is good, let's try for 5 or 6%"
no Dave Callender that's a nice picture of you and your sister.
no Jim Acosta has the gall to  imply/say that the border situation is not a national emergency...........in front of ANGEL MOMS.......this weasel and his fake news pals are colluding with illegal aliens to provide more votes(voter fraud with drivers liscenses that shouldn't be issued to illegals in the first place) for demorats.
yes In 2018 over 37,000 US citizens were killed BY US CITIZENS via gun violence. Why are these deaths less important than the the ones caused by immigrants?
no Great Job Mr. President we've got your back keep up the great work KAG2020 !!!!
no My heart hurts for this family
yes CORRECT  BUILD THE WALL NOW
yes #maga many are getting arrested
yes I dont care what the Left says you, President Trump, you do love our Country and you need to protect us! The Wall is definitely needed! ITS TIME TO BUILD THAT WALL!
no Stay strong!
yes Yes, president trump, ban alcohol too so that nobody dies from alcoholism like your brother fred
no I'm for the wal
yes If walls worked you dipshit, there wouldn't be any drugs, criminals, human trafficking going on. You're just too stupid to understand that. #Conofthedeals
yes Carl Ostendarp art major from yale, oh please tell us lowly working class how to live! Cliche liberal.
no at least the dem side...repub sides on solid ground
no Silvia Serra Lobo uhmmm maybe you should look into what he is saying...
no hahaha Terry Beatus  can't even complete a rational statement
yes Keith Webber Jr.  You are wrong ..you must be in Trump's 35% base
yes Sorry for your loss,build that wall
yes Stay Strong Mr. President. Build the Wall and protect Americans lives and our Country, God Bless.
no Same thing like the girl from Iowa.
no So, so sad.
no Shame on you! For using this tragedy for political purpose! While you ignore the mass shooting in Illinois! 5 died and 5 polices  officers injured! Gun violence is real! Its time to declare a national emergency !
yes Deport and build wall we must defend,Americans first other countries need take care there own
no Not true. 50 people dead so far this year from American citizens shooting each other up. We know what the real emergency is. Most violent crime is not perpetrated by illegal immigrants. Trump just loves to exploit these anecdotal stories when it does happen though.
yes The best president ever!
yes Most crimes are committed by white people, then black people, then other races. Mexicans are not our crime problem but I do agree with securing our borders.
no https://www.facebook.com/367105936678679/photos/a.372249079497698/2040846389304617/?type=3&theater
yes What a crock. Trump said himself he didnt need to call a national emergency he just did it to attempt to sidestep congress.   Illegal immigrants are less likely to kill than native born Americans.  Drugs come in mainly through regular ports of entry. Illegal crossings are at an all time low. But hey who needs facts and rule of law when living in trumps Orwellian universe full of alternative facts.
no Thank you Mr. President! It saddens me that my sons and grandson are not growing up in the same America that I did.  I noticed the most change after Obama.  You are our only hope.  God bless you!
yes BLACK WHITE WHITE WON WHITE HEAT SUN
yes If folks do not think the border problem is a National Emergency, then go tell that to the families of the 70,000 plus that lose family members to drugs each year.  Yes, it is a National Emergency because our people are worth saving from drugs. God Bless You!
no If you threaten or defy American power and might, I encourage you to make your peace with your god and prepare for for your rewards!
yes #FINISHTHATWALL #TRUMP2020
yes Craig J Grove many feel that is just what "they" want ...
no The Government is more dangerous for the American people than anyone crossing the border unfortunately.
yes We need that wall Mr. President'
no Oh you dont care about the American people getting poisoned! But want a wall smh what about the people over here?
no And trump could care less he just wants to use this death to get funding which he will steal for himself to pay hookers to piss on him sad
no I hate the wall and you suck
no If you love America protect them from Russia-Ukraine and all those that come from Russia. And declare your Tax to the Americans you love.
no Chris Wren. Aguilera Samuel can you really ignore this?
yes YES!!!!!!!!!!!!
yes Do you have a security system for your house, lock your doors or call the police when someone enters your home illegally and unwanted with the intent to do something against you? ...I'll wait...
no May GOD be the force that wins this battle.  Have a blessed day with family.  You're entitled to it.  GOD says so.
yes So sorry for your loss it should never happen the loser Democrats will pay one day
yes Just like banning guns wont keep criminals from getting them, a wall won't stop  someone who really wants to from getting in.
no The Greatest President Ever. DONALD J. TRUMP.
yes May God be with you and your wife.  Ill keep your family in my prayers.  God bless
yes How many people need to die before other people care?
yes Keep up good work President Trump
no 13  National Emergency Conditions declared by Hussain Oblama, no suits filed.  1 declared for the illegal invasion of sovereign borders into the USA  by Trump and the Demonrats file a lawsuit and cry, "Unconstitutional!"  These people are the biggest bunch of anti-Americam activists since the Iranians celebrating the attacks against us on 9-11!  Bui.ld The Damn Wall, Democrats!
yes There are too many American killers as well into or out of the country killing people by Townsend and Townsend in wars for example. Dsole. Here also we have assassins of all the countries and own killers as well. What's the example, please, I can't understand the a reason named "why". Please tell me trust. 
yes Skip Rowland El Chapo got caught. Your businesses are over libs. #Build_The_Wall
yes Chuck Martin  Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR
no My sympathies.
no Silvia Serra Lobo He has the facts illegals get benefits right away but Americans are on a waiting list . You get the facts
yes Victoria Kay Riddick Cochran Facebook is not allowing me to see any responses for some reason
yes I need a woman for long team relationship which will lead to marriage
no No mames pinche paisa
yes Thats horrible! She was very beautiful and Im so sorry for your loss.
no White domestic terrorists kill more people than undocumented immigrants. The President should be doing something to solve crises, not create them.
yes Ok ppl are getting paranoid here
no Janet Martin I bet u support mickie mouse too
no Thank God for President Trump!
yes I got no wall around my home and we leave the key  in the door . Weve never had a break-in and there are no guns - Amazingly in Ireland  we have little or no guns and no one carries !  Other then with a few Gangs with illegal Guns - who normally only shoot one another - we dont fear people - or people with GUNS - because there are very seldom seen in #Ireland - no need for WALLS either ????
yes File a law suit against Pelosi and Schumer and take their millions that they have gotten from the cartels.   Unbelievable the demonic-rats!!!
no Shirley Wilson slapdash????
yes I am truly sorry for your loss;however, that does not mean we a wall that costs billions of dollars. We need immigration reforms that are humane and reasonably priced.
no God bless you President Trump
yes A white person killed some ones daughter. What are we going to do about that!
yes And now you just signed an amnesty bill.. great!  How come there never in two years were no figures presented regarding Islamic migration into the US? I t did vastly increase didnt it? While it decreased allot from culturally Christian countries.
yes 10 us code section 284... build the walls
no WATEVER TRUMP ANYTHING TO BRING YOU DOWN
yes Say whatever you want, but what Trump meant was there was no real need for a emergency action. Meaning the Democrats and Republicans could have and should have sorted this out 20,000,000 illegal immigrants ago!
no Mary Langan why?? Do u know there are many tunnels under many border all over the world??
yes Russ Bischoff right on right on right on
no I've been to places where guns are banned. Sure are a lot of people getting shot in those places.
no Dear President Trump....FB  will NOT let me re-post many of my posts....please help me
yes Sofiane Hamouda I got stitches when an illegal immigrant attacked me.  I'd report.  They can come in the right way
no Agree 100% with Eva's statement
no GOVERNMENTS ABOUT TO DROP US ALL IN IT.  Like a juggler trying to keep several objects in the air at the same time - there goes the politicians of the ruling circus that governs this world.  Like clowns hiding behind their public masks - they are but court jesters ruling amidst a menagerie of their own making - as they try to keep so many different people's entertained they are running out of idea's to keep their many different alien patrons happy.  This human zoo from which they have removed the barriers that kept some sort of order - is now becoming a human jungle of wild beasts that are turning more and more on each other as the barriers no longer exist.  All their resources and restraints are being exposed as impotent - as resistance to them is growing by the day - a bunch of circus clowns and jugglers who cannot even keep order among themselves - as they have all been exposed as having their fingers in the till - sleeping with the enemy - and as perverted as is their main stream media mouthpiece acting blameless and preaching like a saint the 'Sermon on the Mount.' on the one hand - when they are all as corrupt as each other.  What's the odds that those clowning circus freaks of power are going to bring the global big top down?
yes Lying POS.
yes  How many more will there be , so sad...the left cant agree... It takes a heartless bunch of Democrats to do what they do well absolutely nothing but care about themselves... guarded ,in their gated fairytale land they live in... what if sumthin like this happen to Pelosi.. AND I dont wish it anyone but its just so sad!!! Get these illegals out .. poor innocent children ,people !!! lost for words ... wake up morons 
yes Americans kill Americans every freakin day. Stupid ass post. I feel bad for the family, but really?
yes Bull crap!  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/nation/2019/02/16/man-kills-five-warehouse-shooting-spree-shortly-after-being-fired-illinois-police-say/Man who kills five in warehouse shooting spree was being fired from his job, Illinois police saywashingtonpost.com
yes Thank you Mr President for working so hard for us America citizens $$/
yes Bob Segal I've listened to trump. I've seen how he works up his base at rallies. . He's inflated statistics to demonize immigrants, refugees, LGBTQ community, minorities and democrats! He has us fighting each other, hating our neighbors . . . . It's what he does.
no Love my president Trump
no Cult of trumpy
yes Sad an all, but doesn't make a valid argument.   Just yesterday 5 people died at the hands of an natural born American citizen. A wall at the border will not stop such things. It'll only waste money that could be better used to help reduce such things....if used correctly.
yes Just build it Im so sick of hearing about it lol nothing will change other than we have a wall
no Sorry for your loss, but white, legal Americans keep killing children and fellow Americans. What's your point?
no Build that wall!!
no The majority living in the area are against it.
yes Yes President keep up the good work youre an amazing man and president!
yes PLEASE...PLEASE...PLEASE....BUILD THE WALL
no It's really necessary
yes And an American killed 5 people and shot 5 police yesterday in Illinois. A wall would not have helped!
no Seriously? What abt all of these deaths? Or are you only concerned abt crimes committed by @certain people or races you dont like? https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/number-of-gun-deaths?page=2&sort=desc&order=State
yes Kelly Anders I'll say it for everyone. Your a fucking idiot.
no Build the wall!! Save our children
no Joseph Nowik, how many more American lives are you willing to sacrifice before it becomes a national emergency in your opinion?
no Listen to him
no We only know what we catch coming in which is a fraction of all the drugs, people & whatnot that slips through Southern border undetected. When 60% of the border is unprotected, finishing the wall is a nobrainer.
no I dont care if you're against the wall. I was against Obamacare and still paid 8 years of fines. Stop your bitching and let's go
no An illegal president killed our country
yes Build the wall ! Trump 2020
no So this situation is made better by allowing illegal dangerous criminals into our country???
no While my heart goes out to you may I say we have many millions who have been killed at the hands of legal citizens,where is the outrage,where is the national emergency for those? We have American citizens that are killers,rapists,drug dealers,human traffickers,gangsters,and such. The only reason these families are even on Trump's radar is because it fits into his narrative.
no I am giving a $100 a month until Border Patrol has everything they need!  My heart breaks for Angel Mom and Dads and the rest of their family and friends!
no Build that Wall
yes Damn right ! The democrats are imbeciles ! They care more about an illegal than your daughter ! Truly Sad ! Trump 2020 !
yes Cal Phillips  soo..... u blaming immigrants for selling ur kid drugs that he bought with his money and his decision hmmm in that care i got 6 friends that are white and sell cocain heroin weed flaka acid xanax  and one of my friends is hispanic and died because of one of them how bout give the land you guys took stingy ass crackers
yes Mr. President Thank God you are working for the American people even though some are not able to see your efforts as what needs to happen.
no Paulo Americo Rocha I can't see the comments private message me
yes If thats your priority try to do something about mass shootings
yes Patti Cullen as apposed to who Obama ? are you mentally handicapped ?  Obama scammed us out of fucking billions .. he gave billions to fucking Iran and then tried to tell us that we somehow owed them half of their entire worth because of some deal the Shaw made with us in the 70s?   .. ueah for half of the entire worth of their country .. for a deal made with a regime that was our friend that we have no obligation to return to a different regime that is one of our number one enemies .. who who who is the con artist ? fucking moron
no #fearmonger
yes Walls work...get over Hillary!
no I need a remedy
no My buddy was killed by a man who turned out to be of Jewish descent. I dunno what I should support...
yes Dems are as dumb as a box of rocks.They wouldn't know an emergency if it hit them in the face. Nothing but a bunch of Satanist .
no Tony Rainwater armed guards at schools seems to be working these days, no law abiding gun owner would ever attack a school let alone children, only the crazy CRIMINALS who obtain guns illegally seem to shoot up schools, might wanna go after them...
yes So no gun control ?
yes Done now your turn!!
no Danny Jones Thank you for the kind thought.  This American really understands your anguish. It seems our culture is also being destroyed. Our President is trying with all his might to stop that from taking place.  I sincerely hope brexit goes though for the UK and that WE get  our border wall.
no Juanita H. Smart  Seriously, thats the 3rd time youve said that.
yes Large walls with armed guards anyway
yes So sorry,hope wall built soon.
yes Let's be clear, this was a car accident. It was vehicular homicide, NOT murder. We still don't know if Joel Velasquez is illegally in the country or not. We don't know if a wall woulda helped or not.
yes Brian Sterling many ifs there jefe
yes If the illegal population voted Republican guess how fast an armed electric fence with a mine field would be built........
no Timothy Kershner good for him  the illegal that murdered my friends child got squat!! Build that wall
no Check out Trump cherry picking stories to suit his political narrative. Your wall will not function Donald J. Trump.
no what was his name?  why havent we heard from these people before
yes Yes. There are a lot of hateful trolls.  Id personally go build that wall especially if it would save lives
yes So sorry for your loss and yes we need to protect our citizens. No one complains about foreign countries laws regarding entering their country. Why do we allow it, anyone can come here just do it legally!!
no My heart breaks for all the Angel Families, so sad
yes Dont you realize, a border is not going to keep the bad outitll only the establish the evil within
yes Wish we had a government in the UK like yours.
no https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NTDMG9V
no Yes, Protect all Americans!! 5 killed yesterday from US citizen. The national emergency is gun control and affordable healthcare!! Not wasting money on a wall, Years in the courts!!
yes That's like saying that because Dahmer killed your kid we need a wall around Milwaukee.
no More American citizens kill Americans than illegals do ! FACT !!
yes Worley Michael, you are an idiot, we need to send fools like you to Mexico and South America with the rest of the ilegals and build our wall to keep you out.
yes https://www.kvia.com/news/border/far-from-migrant-caravans-border-crossings-surge-in-texas/911604294
yes President Donald J. Trump; BUILD THE WALL NO MATTER WHAT!!!  Please protect us, "We The People"!!!!!
no Mark Schwendau youre a lying liar.
no #GREAT PRESIDENT45.
yes An American citizen killed 59 and wounded 500 at a Jason Aldean concert. Don't use these type of stories for reasons to build a wall. There are plenty of more valid ones. But this is making it look like the United States doesn't have murderers of their own. This causes people to hate people that look like me.
yes Why didn't Trump build a wall two years ago when he had a majority in Congress...Because it was not an emergency. Illegal border crossings and apprehensions have been declining for nearly two decades, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and in 2017 were at their lowest point since 1971. A 2018 study published by the Cato Institute found that undocumented immigrants commit less crime than native-born citizens, and according to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) the majority of illegal drugs coming into the country across the southern border are being smuggled through legal points of entry. In other words, this president has manufactured an immigration crisis for his own political gain.
yes After all the national emergencies for other countries from the past president.  About time we use one for our own country!
yes Ahmad Mahmoud and you hide your head in a rag and cover your ugly women with body rags. Get on your camel goat fucker and leave
yes Veronica Sanchez grew up near Detroit....
yes We need one arround Puerto Rico to keep the illegals out
yes I am not picking on Donald J. Trump screw that am sure he wouldn't actually wrestle me because I am a girl but if it were a wrestling match or just romping around like a bunch of kids yea I would bet he would be tough as nails to wrestle. Heck my brothers and sisters and I are all in our 10s, 402, and 30s and we still wrestle just for the fun of it all.  Whippin' up on each other just for fun so yea if he wants to wrestle heck yea I would wrestle with im because heck I love to romp and carry on like a child even though I am 37 years old. its all fun and games.  Heck yea its on.  but only in fun no meanness
no David Woodsmall the difference is their using those events to push for reform that can actually save lives in the future. A border wall is ineffective in preventing these deaths
yes Hmmm...not a single mention of his Type 1 Lia-abetes.
no A legal American citizen killed 5 in Illinois yesterday in yet another mass shooting in Aurora. Get your priorities, straight...fool. that's an emergency.
yes Must monitor for tunnels and should put razor wire at top of wall .
yes Luke Tierney WALL!!
yes WHAT IS THIS WITH THIS WALL AND THE DEMOCRATS AND RINO'S???? I cannot believe we Americans,no matter what side of the aisle would not want the wall unless you are an illegal or have some personal interest in having open borders.  We desperately need immigration reform and we need the wall..  We may not need the whole wall today but we will need it as time progresses.  Last time 15,000 people came to the border.  How many next time or the next time?  And who or what will they be bringing with them?  We have 3000 miles in the southern border that needs protecting.  We need it for our future.  It is always better to be prepared for danger.  Our current Congress is driving me nuts that they have  become so un-american.  I believe in legal immigration, always will.  I just don't believe in illegal immigration in any shape or form in today's world. Try to imagine thousands of people coming into our country illegally every year with no background checks,no job, etc.  Either should our congress.  All American democrats for the wall please start inundating your representatives with phone calls, letters, twitter, e-mail, whatever way you can to show your support for the immigration reform and the wall even if you don't agree with other legislation the president is presenting.  It's important to our future economy, safety, taxes, educational resources for our children.  Keep our taxes here and our country safe.  an ounce of protection is worth a pound of cure.
yes Oh, that makes a big difference then, so the wall will keep democrats out also?  Poor trump followers, bunch of ignorants with stupid arguments
no FACT: Immigrants commit crimes at a lower percentage than American citizens do. Stop spreading propaganda.
yes Without a doubt.....
no SO it's a competition?! I s that  what your point is?! Or are you saying that crime by our own citizens justifies letting illegals border jumpers in?! "Meaningful gun reform?!" Exactly what is that?!  Most of the schools and mass shooters have obtained their weapons LEGALLY, through background checks and "common sense gun controls!" The Florida theatre shooter bought one just for the occasion the day of the shooting! Or then you have those who are criminals like the Aurora shooter of 5 who couldn't get a legal gun so guess what he did, come on Chris, guess what HE DID?! He got one ILLEGALLY!  Not one gun used in a mass shooting in this country was acquired by private sale or transfer either! The UnConstitutional Common sense gun controls we allowed last time with the promise "this will fix the problem" even knowing it would not, have failed miserably and cannot be documented as saving ONE, not ONE American life! You know what has worked, good law abiding citizens who were armed and shot back! You really are a myopic liberal lubricant! #ShallNotBeInfringed!
no They are everywhere driving with no license. They have damaged two of my vehicles that I had to pay to repair. They do not even get cited and are released. I couldn't imagine losing a loved one. It is a huge problem and the cities and churches are conspiring to bring them here. Everyone pays higher insurance rates because of the damage they do. States ignore the fact that one legal person registers 100's of cars for them to drive. The corruption is disgusting. Ohio is overrun with illegals and I am sure most states are. I have few neighbors that speak English in Ohio.
no you want protection or you want TRUMP wall?
no Too many lives lost at the hands of Illegals! From drugs, murders, hit and runs, and drunk driving. BUILD THAT WALL NOW.  DEPORT ILLEGALS.
no Dave Heffner or TDR.
yes Have to stop electing democrates
yes So sorry for your loss.  Thank you for standing up for the victims of illegal aliens and the families of those victims.
no Mary Jean Schroeder you mean white people that's kill children at school do all mass shooter
yes #FinishTheWall
yes Finish the Wall, Mr. President!  We are with you!  #WWG1WGA 
yes Thank you for speaking out. Prayers of peace for you and your family.
no HISPANIC CHURCH DIVIDED BY THE COMMIES. GET ALL HISPANICS BEHIND THE RIGHT. NEW MEXICO IS LOSING ITS COUNTRY TO ILLEGALS FROM THE MIDDLE EAST.
no A Republican killed my co-worker. Deport them all.
yes Trump is god for this time Americans people he doing good job in Washington DC
yes COMPLETE A COMPLETE boarder wall !!
yes Forehead thinking
yes Its an incredibly sad day when liberals care more about foreigners than they do about our wives in children. I have no use for them and wish them straight to hell unless they change  their ways
yes 1. Day 758 of 1462 (Illegitimate Presidency) - Embarrassing! The WORLD is laughing at the USA...VP Mike Pence speaking before a Security Conference in Munich was greeted with silence where the crowd was supposed to applaud. He looked visibly shaken after the 2nd time...Again, the WORLD is laughing at the USA b/c of Donald KKK Trump!  https://www.rawstory.com/2019/02/mike-pence-visibly-shook-nobody-claps-applause-lines-disastrous-european-trip/
yes Yes and citizen opened fire on school kids at parkland last year. And shot up a factory two days ago. Your point?
no #FinishTheWall #NoAmnesty #NoDACA #AmericaFirst #Trump2020
yes Walls help as a big part of comprehensive plan.  Walls will never stand alone.  But added to tech and manpower and better enforced laws, walls are one important part of the package.
no An American killed my Compa!!! He was from back east build that wall down the middle of America!!
yes SO AWFUL
yes Ed Wrany not even the best president this afternoon  ...
no My 4 grandparents came to America legally.  Why cant they?  My son died from illegal drugs.  Where did the drugs come from?
no Those opposed, weve lost control over the dangerous people already here, want more? Unlock your doors, take down your walls...
yes President  should look into  3.5 billion that Newsom has breached  contract  for the fast train in ca  he shut down
yes Dave Callender coming from a man who lives in New Hampshire where people don't lock their doors come down to South Texas you'll change your mind
yes Democrats caused the govt shutdown....Democrats are InHumane. They hate Americans and WAWAWA CRYBABIES Personal Vendettas agAinst us True Americans Republicans should be our Congress Office since we have a Republican President...
no Anthony Clark they send billions to other countries, I believe they should do more here but, it does not mean we shouldnt have a wall!
yes And plenty of people have lost loved ones at the hands of US citizens. The wall is your dog whistle to your sycophant supporters. Youre a traitor trump, resign.
no how many legal citizens are murderer?
yes Peter Stock then why do you live in a structure with 4 walls? Remove your walls and welcome them to your home.  If you do this.. I will then support you 100%.
yes What about families killed in shootings by white unstable Americans dont see u doing anything about that
no So proud of you Mr. President! Build it!!!!!!! Keep us safe:)
yes People please, there is no need to justify a barrier leading crossers to ports of entry, it's called rules, even the bad guys aside, it's our country period and we people call the shots, period.
yes Agree!!! I have a list of people to deport and revoke their fake citizenship  have proof they lied on their application
no Duh. Tell us something we don't know.
yes I hope to leave  Egypt  and emigrate  to america ... please mr president  help me about that
no ok mr know it all what would
yes This is the lamest excuse for a wall . Sorry for ur lost but u so wrong - lmao
yes Such stupidity
no The deal can include completely unrelated incentives for the United Kingdom since President Trump said Americans will do the construction and use American steel. It's a win-win. A treaty isn't even needed between friends.
yes Dave Sienknecht nope no way they are coming through the dessert. Really come on, this is a real news report.
no I see illegal immigrants walking working traveling freely in USA,,, it looks like someone is not doing his job !!!
yes Bulls the wall
no Trump 2020!!!!
yes Can I asked how they were an illegal resident?? Did they over stayed their vacation visa like majority of the illegal immigrants? Did they travel over by planes or cross over at the port of entry with a granted visa to only visit and return after their purpose? If so, if they were part of the 62% of illegal immigrants that are here by overstaying past their due dates... how is the wall going to stop others? Now if they were here illegally by hiking through the fields and crossing over outside port of entry, then I support the wall. I just want to know the facts.
yes Steve Finigian you should research before dropping BS.
yes So sad for you
yes Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin WHAT PART OF ILLEGAL MAKES YOU THINK LAW ABIDING  THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE GUY IN THE MILITARY WAS PUNISHED AND YOU COULD GET SOME COMPENSATION FOR YOUR LOSS  BUT YOU ARE TOO BLIND TO SEE THAT  ILLEGAL MEANS ILLEGAL ILLEGAL MEANS AGAINST THE LAW   ONLY LIBERALS THINK ILLEGAL MEANS OBEYING THE LAW
yes Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive its an American society problem. If you really cared about this guy and his daughter you would address that.
no Ron Gagnon  In this great emergency, Trump decided to play golf.
no Do it big man
yes I just don't understand the Democrats and their coldness to these families who have lost loved ones to illegals.   I'm so sorry for all the losses and pray President Trump will get the wall built and our borders protected the way they should be protected.
no Someone needs to go ahead and kill trump instead of shooting schools
yes Most of them are CRIMINALS,  so sorry for your loss!
no Im an airhead because my opinion is different than yours? Ok then.
yes Thank you sir
yes Propaganda ..
yes Bill Reese unfortunate accidents happen all the time. This story is purely about blaming illegal immigrants. And I will still stand with that is petty. Might as well blame the place that made the beer, maker of the truck, whom sold them gas.
yes Carl Mrner we will have guards patrolling the area.  I would like a minefield but I do not see that getting approved.
yes We all need to stand up for our self and our President that stands up for the United States people every day and build that wall.
no Yall lost your minds
yes Oh... so now we are putting Diabetics insulin use ABOVE the LIVES of American Citizens???????  Apples and Oranges people... TWO SEPARATE ISSUES... and definitely an invalid argument.  diabetics have health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid (not to mention thousands of state and private agencies who help when the federal agencies cannot/dont) to cover their insulin costs.  Speaking from a household that has two diabetics, one of them myself!   Hugs  Get the facts straight! 
no Do something about mass shootings, asshole. 
yes I am sorry for your loss
yes Thank you for caring about Mandy Ferguson! Thank you for protecting American citizens!
yes Troll
no Tommy Carpenter I am good....husband died peacefully at home where he had bought and paid for doing what he loved.
no #elongatedskullsofperu
yes Charlesetta Brown there are tons of crimes by illegals that go unreported by media. And, you make the point for us supporters. We have enough home grown criminals to deal with, without opening the border for criminals from other countries. We have far too much crime as it is, and do not need more. So, your argument just worked against you. Thanks for playing, we'll see next week on the wall has begun
yes Timothy Kershner pussy
yes Kimberly Mansfield  get rid of illegals and hey there a whole lot of extra money for mental health
yes Agree build that wall!
yes Kyle Callender from what the CHP officer stated, he came through Texas, thats all they had on the report. No address nothing.
yes Did this illegal immigrant even cross the border by ground or did they over stay their Visa or arrive by air or boat? A wall can only possibly stop one way of arrival, the most least used by illegal immigrants... a wall is stupid.
no Marge Hackett Fox news!
no Immigrants can kill. So can any other human being within the country.
yes GOD BLESS OUR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP
no God Bless President Trump!!
yes ??? And then?
yes So sorry, Sir, for the loss of your daughter. I stand with you in support of the boarder wall. We have the need to feel safe.
yes I'll help build the wall ... Save our jobs . Our benefits & health care .
yes BUILD THE WALL! See what's happening when we let illegals just walk in. We need to start caring for our own country. USA! USA! USA!
yes Eva Graham  You are so ignorant
yes Tudy Anderson Latulip a wall will not stop the illegal handouts and instantly relocate that money to vets. A wall will take decades to build and vets should not have to wait.
no BUILD THAT WALL
yes If that is the case, shouldn't you put a wall around Chicago?
yes Yes,
no Illegal immigrants commit murder so do American citizens. #Donthecon
yes she should not have died and wouldnt have if that Illegal hadnt of been in our Country.
yes That's absolutly bullshit
no STFU Donny
no Nazi's used propaganda like that to condemn the Jews.
no Walls, fence whatever you call it slow people down allowing us to get there and catch them. Also stops drive vehicles from just driving through in places like AZ. Also need the Congress to change laws to stop the flow of people so we can focus on the bad guys.
yes Abdul Majid legal. You do know the difference hopefully
yes Build it TALL
no So sorry! Now senator from Texas John Cornyn is saying hes against Trump getting wall build !! Hes up for election we have too vote him out of office. He is worse then a democrat. Cornyn he is killing America.
no I am so sorry for this man's loss of his daughter @
yes BUILD THE WALL AND BUILD IT TALL
no Carl Ostendarp guns again are not the problem people kill people not guns snowflake
no Agree Mr. President. Im upset that ur party failed us but they're replacable too!
yes And a US citizen shot up Columbine, Shot up Parkland, don't get me started on Eric Robert Rudolph, or Ted Bundy. American Terrorist attack at the 96 Olympics in Atl. Yeah our prisons are filled with Americans. Whats your excuse now? Try again.
yes We really need the wall .
yes Ocasio-Cortez and New York Democrats put poor people out of work. THINK. There would have been thousands of jobs Like cleaning Restaurants Office Construction Democrats putting people into Poverty   Not helping people. Democrats hurt people
no Steve Cotton  Shouldve been armed and protected them,
yes The person who sold him the beer didn't hold a gun to his head and force him to drink too much. The car dealer didn't force him at gunpoint to drive drunk. It's simply called TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS!! No one forced them to kill these people - they did this by themselves. So, before you shoot your mouth off, be sure your brain is loaded!! Call us when you get some common sense. What an idiot. Ain't got the brains God gave an ant!!
yes We Support Our President! Finish the Wall! Trump 2020
no Sheryl Whitfield-Tolliver   love your irony........hahaha  - seriously not a consent comment
no This is to sad how many deaths of American Citizens need to happen and how much money do we need to give illegals before democrats wake up and realize without the wall Americans aren't as safe and are suffering the consequences of the Democratic decisons.. #AmericaFirst #BuildTheWall
yes The statistic shows the number of mass shootings in the United States between 1982 and November 19, 2018, by race and ethnicity of the shooter(s). Between 1982 and November 2018, 60 out of 107 mass shootings were initiated by White shooters. The Las Vegas strip massacre in 2017 had the highest number of victims between 1982 and 2018, with 58 people killed, and over 500 injured. Additional information on mass shooter profiles in the United States  The high number of tragic mass shootings that have occurred in the United States has led to a large amount of attention on the profile of the people who commit such violent acts. A look at the worst mass shootings in the United States suggests no clear common connections other than a tendency to undertake mass shootings in educational institutions and other populated areas. However, a look at mass shootings in the United States by gender shows a great majority of mass shootings are carried out by men.  With no clear patterns between the socio-economic or cultural background of mass shooters increasing attention has been placed on mental health. Analysis of the factors Americans considered to be to blame for mass shootings showed 48 percent of people felt the inability of the mental health system to recognize those who pose a danger to others was a significant factor. Further attention has also been given to the factors influencing the behavior of mass shooters. Surveys on violence in the media and drug use as potential factors show that many Americans place blame on these influences.  In the wake of multiple mass shootings critics have sought to look beyond the issues of shooter identification and their influences by focusing on their access to guns. The study mentioned above showed 61 percent of Americans felt the easy access to firearms was to blame by either a great deal or a fair amount. Hide
no An American murdered 5 people in a bank and another one murdered more today and yesterday too.
no DemocRats don't care, unfortunately.  They LOVE illegals
yes Thank you Mr. President for caring about America while the democrats don't.

no 4000 Americans died last year at the hands of illegal aliens. Thats an average of 5 a week.  When is enough, enough?
yes He flew in from Portugal. He's Portuguese. Build a wall at the airport he flew into.
yes BUILD THAT WALL MR. PRESIDENT! I'm with you on this!
yes No.  Fear mongering is wrong. Smart border security like walls and fencing and technology.  The  majority of illegal immigration and drugs come through ports of entry..
no Amen to that
no ARE YOU ATTEMPTING A MASSACRE??!!!!!!  AND WHO IS SPREADING FALSE RUMORS ABOUT ME AND THE PRESIDENT??!!!!!!  I AM ASKING WHAT HAPPENED AT the address of 2717 South Normandie Avenue in Los Angeles, California 90007 during the 11th hour of February 16th, 2019!!!!  Does it have anything to do with under covered authorities retaliating because they KNOWINGLY REFUSED TO HELP ME WEEKS BEFORE THE FACEBOOK LINK BELOW?!  My comments may be found underneath them.  https://www.facebook.com/NASA/posts/10156928323646772/  https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/717737358622614/
yes Anthony Clark the entire city is run by democrats thats what happens  Also the water crisis ended April of last year
no Are you fucking kidding me right now?
yes I am so sorry for your loss!
no "Walls don't work" is a NON argument. Not supported by facts at all. I can bring fact after fact about walls WORKING. So enough with the manufactured bullshit talking points from the lib media.
yes Joseph Nowik  Juarez mexico is one of the most dangerous cities look it up . Its behind our border and if them walls are not fully secure or they come down thier dangerous city will be part of our country because they can walk over . Think about that ! Think about your family to be safe.
yes https://www.watchdog.org/national/reports-illegal-immigrants-receiving-medicaid-costs-taxpayers-billion-annually/article_6a9860a6-d0bd-11e8-92ed-5bca8b2d3b38.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=user-share

no An illegal killed my son.... build the wall!!!!!!
yes .org/36942///PEBvgJX0hnDHuK9/fcbg/?cat=1&pid=1&i=1163951
no Stacey Britton fear mongering?  You mean like when democrats said if Trump was elected the stock market would crash and possibly never recover?  Or them screaming that Trump would start a nuclear war?  Or that he would take away woman's rights, black rights, gay rights?     All democrats have is fear mongering.
yes Gary Hooper, you have no facts to counter my comments so you resort to name calling.  It's classic for your type!
yes Its a pity, Mr President. America is such a beautiful nation. A decade ago, I went to California to study. I should have fit right in, I spoke perfect English and Spanish, I was paying for my own schooling, and had a bright career ahead of myself being a hardworking person, and a Deans List student in a STEM field. Having gotten out of Venezuela while the getting was good, I felt I was in a land of opportunity and that with hard work, perseverance, and respect there was room for my dreams to come true in this environment. It had not been easy to secure a visa to go to America to study, and staying would not be easy either but my love of the country and its ideals made me determined to try. Life chose a different path for me. Upon finishing college, there was a full-blown economic crisis in the country. I left to Asia where young people like me could more easily find work based on special skills and secure a visa. Others in California suggested I could just stay illegally and eventually use loopholes to claim asylum and go on welfare  but I had too much respect for myself and for the country to do that.   I have spent many years in developed Asia now and I still cannot understand how this situation is still crippling the America I once knew and loved. Over here there is no welfarism, basically no handouts of any kind, and zero tolerance for immigration violations. The result is virtually no crime and very little of thr social ills now a mainstay in every American community: single-parent households, drug addiction, and degeneracy. Over here, there is a vibrant community of highly-skilled and entrepreneurial people from overseas who call cities here home but it not a mass phenomenon. We all have dreams, as do the native citizens here, but we all understand no one has a right to break the law to fulfil their dreams.   Americans, too, have dreams. The establishment politicians and the media have allowed emotional terrorism to dominate the debate on immigration and the rule of law in the United States. Only principles can be used to rein in emotions. I pray for your country everyday and hope the principled will of the American people can win the day in these trying times.
no Joseph Roy Yes we should and we should do something about all the white guys with guns killing all of our women and children too dont you think? Yet we do NOTHING, heck the so called prez never has much to say about any of that does he, only focuses on mexicans day in and day out. So messed up!
no When Trump finish fucking up the economy they will leave anyway!!!
yes We need the wall!!!
no Daniel Alexander Allen Please provide a link to back up that statement or do you just make stuff up as you go along?
yes Who are the legal immigrants who are in jail in the USA???
yes Estefania Torres Restrepo look it up you moron. Look up what the border agents, the chief and mayors have said. I would be embarrassed if my heritage invaded a country where they committed crimes, most couldn't speak English, had no skill, didn't assimilate, didn't care about AMERICA and cost the American Tax Payers 130 billion a year
no TEACHING  THE  RIGHT  WAY !..    https://www.facebook.com/prageru/videos/1878883872216452/
yes Walls wont stop where illegals are the most coming in: Canada, airports, seaports and LEGAL points of entry.  And Trump sure didnt care about that when he hired ILLEGAS for his properties up until just recently WHEN HE GOT CAUGHT.  This just shows Trump cares more about re-election than solving real problems.
no For all those against the wall, look at all the DEMS and liberals that have huge walls and tell me why they have them? Is your door open or do you lock it at night or when you leave the house?!
yes Bob Stubbe the National Emegency guts anything Trump wants gutted in the bill, Trump and his team basically used Obama's precedent to do to
no Linda Durbin
no I notice alot of people who just seem to strangely believe that once a new president come in he snaps his fingers and suddenly everything good that happens his because of him. The first 3 to 3 and half years the current president is riding on the previous one did like how Obama's first years and company unemployment and so on was thanks to goerge Bush goerge Bush was riding Clinton's so he had a surplus in the begening and Bill's didnt start well because of Reagan's deficit. Pay attention for one you can learn alot.
yes yes exactly, the dem abortions. fucking genius response.
no Prayers for you and the wall
no Love my President Trump!
no Build the wall ! Enforce the laws.
no Let's build a big mosque over the white house and invte the Bin Laden family to design and build it
yes Lead by example.....GTFO
yes So sorry too all of you for your unimaginable losses.   BUILD THE WALL MR. PRESIDENT!!!   #buildthewall
no There are legal means in which to come in by.
yes Build the wall !
no Amen.
yes A illegal immigrant killed my friend georgia, he kidnapped her, beat her, raped her and then murdered her and sadly a few other women too before they could find him and take him down.
yes Sean Walsh your comment doesn't deserve it
yes Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
yes You can't hate an entire race for one persons screw up, what if every race that white people did wrong forced you back to where your ancestors came from because trump got one person killed, one person.. You can't live life in anger and hate, it solve nothing and creates chaos... A wall should be built agreed , but hate is not the reason. Passion deprived from a Greek word "pascho" meaning affliction or suffer. "You ask God and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions". James 4:3
no Rich Pal both
yes how does it feel, Charles, to live your life being a disrespectful little punk?
yes Julie Albers Hampe the money was released money that belonged to Iran. Get the facts.
no Keith Webber Jr. you stupid!!! Most of all you are probably on the system..
no Richard Boudreaux they will... first you have to build it and than get paid from Mexico.... its gonna take a little time.... Ill be laughing when Mexico pays for it without knowing about it....
no Aden
yes Wall not fence
yes We are with you Mr. President Trump
no Nancy and Chuck could care less how many are killed as long as they can get the illegal votes and keep the power they wield over the people, they believe in lie, cheat steal and falsely accuse but don't lose power. People should demand that Nancy move out from her fenced security guard home in the rich neighborhood and live in an area with her constituents, the bitch would not last a day. Also should be illegal for her husband to get Government contracts that they make millions on. and to top it off she will retire with over $800,000 per year paid for by the taxpayers of this country.  sorry for the rant, however the people fighting against border security are doing so to line their own pockets.
yes I have seen people driving whom cannot speak or read english and the signs are in English. I've seen them drive 18 wheel trucks and come and ask for directions how to go somewhere. Companies hire illegals.
yes Climate Change?
no Sorry. Mr. President. You shouldnt sign the bill and accepted what the democrats wanted on immigration. U cant trust dems. Now Its going to get worse the southern border problems
yes Yes it is important if its the only way to stop the influx of illegals
yes Yes.  We need the wall.  Thank you Mr. President.
yes wipe your chin...i don't think hes that into you
no What about the thousands of citizens that kill citizens?
yes This is a shame that we have lost any brother or family member! Politicians it will come to you some day more especially you corrupt shits that call yourself our representatives of the people!I call bullshit! When and if it does I do not want to hear one word of grief nor television media about it! Just live with it and move on because the Immigrants are not the problem! YOU POLITICIANS ARE THE WHOLE PROBLEM!  Build the damn wall Trump!
no Jeff Trek
yes https://youtu.be/tlfOPvUABnw
yes Betty Jo Lollis thank you! I only shared so this way people know that MOST if not ALL illegals won't accept the word "NO" I have learned from this experience and I only hope that my story will entice others to break their silence too. It's ok to talk about it. It's a BIG problem amongst other things as well.
yes Sorry for the losses but the wall will help in many ways
yes It's interesting, a handful of illegal immigrants commit crimes, and you ride on those stories for as long as possible. You show sympathy and support for their families and believe something needs to be done immediately to prevent it from happening again.  Meanwhile, over 400 southern baptist employees are found to have sexually abused church members, mainly children....absolute silence. Because those are just the few bad apples right?
no On the contrary, it is a broken tool that would not have done much anyway even when whole; you don;t use broken already inadequate but REALLY expensive tools to address a problem when you have tools that are whole, work well, and cost much less.
no Danny:  Brexit is going to be a disaster, voted on by the same rural rubes who voted in Trump. You are in for a rude awakening when the welfare dries up because of all the lost tax revenue when London loses thousands of high paying fianc jobs.
yes Help Tymoshenko to become the President of Ukraine and we will come and build your wall without a congress.
yes Trump #2020
no Me too I need my wall
no Mark Schwendau Id LOVE to see your credible link regarding this.
no Permanent separation means nothing to baby killing democrats.  How can any democrat consider any of their candidates or voting democrat?  Those freebies buy a lot of votes
yes Let's just forget about all the victims murdered y white people who had guns, I guess.
no Guess what stupid, there was another mass shooting yesterday!!!!
yes Hailey King was my 18 year old cousin. She was left in the street to die by an illegal who hit her and her friend on a Scooter. He was doing over 70 MPH in a 35 zone. After he hit them from behind, throwing Hailey onto his windshield and falling in the street he continued to drag her friend and the Scooter for Blocks until his legs were torn off. Hailey had a Baby girl that will never know her Mommy's voice and her friend is a double amputee.The illegal immigrant that is supposed to be deported at the end of his prison term(originally 17 years) will be out of prison in 2021 (2 yrs for a life and pair of legs), do you want him in your neighborhood? Would you trade places with my family? I stand with my President! Thank you and God Bless you President Donald J. Trump. #ChristianforTrump
no One of the many examples of why we need better border security.  And yet, I always see liberals throwing up people like Dylan Roof and others who a wall wouldnt stop.  They obviously miss the point.  No, a wall wont stop the Dylan Roofs but it will stop the murders by people who never should have been in the country in the first place.
yes So many ears listen to the libtards. You are spot on Deb!
yes Why dont liberals quit crying about the wall and get back to aborting full term babies?
yes OK Stop sending 39 billion dollars to EU!!! I second that for any reason!!! You By Wall!! We Stop Payment to EU,Mexico,Guetamala,ElSalvador,Venezuela,Haiti,Africa,And Everybody!!! Great!!!
yes Glad i live in canada you guys are nuts
yes Amen God bless are President
yes That's one reason we love and respect you, you genuinely care about the american people.   
yes Maximus Herrera i wouldn't try  it the rednecks don't take things lightly and you wouldn't like the ending if you tried ask one.
yes My heart goes out to you
yes Yeah and vote out the people that been running your city for years
yes Matt Martine but criminal's dont care about gun laws they go around them but all these gun laws hurt law abiding people guns dont kill people, people kill people.
no You're the most divisive and disgusting president ever, I support any wall,that leaves your sorry excuse for a soul on the other side of it.
yes Support him in 2020!  Please people dont forget!  Every vote is needed!
yes A Minefield and some Constantine wire might work to
yes So sorry for ur loss.
no Carl Ostendarp Kids wouldnt be here if criminal parents or others sneaking them in STAYED HOME!
yes R. Ryan Roach Duh. They're politicizing this poor woman's death to sell the building of the wall. If he got here by plane or boat, that's horrible, don't you think?
yes Oh pleez, Ted Bundy was a natural born citizen, and we all know how well that turned out.
yes Marcos Ramirez thank Obama for 17 trillion of that
no Jeanie Railsback then they will be slaughtered!
no https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2357228927845882&set=a.1834543650114415&type=3&eid=ARAtfb1BnQ_MZVdjIh9kj3ORtxVQFKmMxhbWG4FNFxOV-wqBRkNyj3TGuvN_Orp0lXm7-oB_BBYXPJvy
no Keep ROCKING It Mr.President...best POTUS EVER! Thank you,  thank you, thank you!  Maybe my husband can keep his construction job now...i was well past time for some one to do something! We had been promised solutions by every single administration before you, and they did nothing except steal the money that was supposed to be for a wall? But now YOU are the bad guy...such hypocrisy I've never seen, keep cleaning that swamp Mr.President,  we are behind you 100%...good Americans believe in EVERYTHING you are doing! Also time to make California responsible for disobeying the Commander and Cheif...if they don't do as the POTUS Orders....cut Federal Dollars to them....its time these sanctuary states, who pull their troops out, though you ordered them there...to be held accountable for their actions....no more monry! And move YOUR TROOPS where you order them to be....they have NO CHOICE or say in this issue! This American who's father,  grandfather,  great grandfather's and brothers served this Country honorably,  is appalled at these actions, and every action that has been taken to disrupt,  userp,  disobey our POTUS....Treason is treason..and it's past time to invoke this Mr.President! I'm sorry,  but it just is!!!!
no Put a wall around Illinois, mass shooting, Chicago murder rate.  Put a wall around LA lots of gangs and murder there. Put a wall aroung FLA, NY, Michigan the crime in their large cities deserves to stay behind walls. Come on Trump you are all powerful now declaring national emergencies, over riding your constitution for your own gain. You are soon to be the USAs first Emperor.
yes AMEN.USMC. build the wall mr. Trump we don't want the old legal c r we don't want the human trafficking of young girls we don't want all the drugs in our country that we don't want all the drugs in our country that are walls keep out the cartel 2 the drug cartel
yes You're a lying wonder 45! When you die soon there will be celebrating and feasting. In your adderall loaded mind the homegrown terrorists are very fine people.
yes Thanks for actually working for the American people to secure our country.
no Totally and utterly 100 % backup from Denmark, Scandinavia   The world is getting TIRED of not being able to do anything.
no Eva Graham , Pelosi just keeps on babbling non stop, someone please escort her back to California & tie her to her rocking chair
yes More Americans die at the hands of other Americans via gun violence but the wall is an emergency?
no Chuy Jesus Santy actually , its Asian that's killed the most people , do some reading...that's real
yes "An illegal immigrant..."
no Yes we need the wall bad.
no the Democrats have never had a loved one murdered or rape .if they had they would have already built the wall twice.
yes I dont care Do you?
no Disgusting how an illegal immigrant kills a human being and basically gets off scott free and  a friend of mine who was a homeless vet with mental issues and PTSD attempts to kill a guy in California, victim lives and can't remember what happened and my friend faces life plus 20? Oh yeah forgot my friend isn't an illegal immigrant.
no Ron Gagnon  Democrats had no reason to keep from funding the wall since they voted for it previously in the Obama presidency.
no Build That Wall !!
no Why did my taxes go up $7,000 ya prick? Screw you and your bullshit tax law.
yes John N Karen Morris are you here legally? Prove it
no An illegal immigrant hit my car broadside which put me in the hospital with 4 broken bones, he didn't have a license or any insurance.  We definitely need a wall!
no I dont care how many come over the border I dont want one here taking up jobs give them your job give them your house give them your wife and your kids I dont care
yes So sorry for your loss. Build the Wall
no Hany Kamel QURAN CHAPTER  3 AL- MRAN VERSES 59  The likeness of Jesus in Allah's sight is that of Adam: He created him from dust, then said to him, "Be," and he was.   60  The truth is from your Lord, so do not be of those who doubt.
yes Linda Durbin One angel family does not a crisis make!!!!  Trump declares national emergency...  Nobodys done the job that weve done on the border,  said Donny as he declares a national emergency today........the slowest emergency in history.  And with the lawsuits that will ensue, his wall will not be funded or built until after the next election...if ever.  THE WORLDS SLOWEST EMERGENCY!!!!!  Donny lied directly to Americans about his border crisis.  Our Liar-in-Chief said that all the data that refutes his crisis designation is lies.  Got that?  Our president told the American people that THE FACTS ARE LIES...this is what all wannabe dictators say.  This egomaniac is THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!  Donny doesnt seem terribly concerned about this crisis.  He plans to travel to Florida mere hours after declaring the emergency from the White House. A president, in times of strife, would typically stay in the nations capital to oversee the crisis. Donny plans to do so from the comfort of his weekend getaway.  In reality, Donny is preparing the country for a fake war as he plans to enjoy a mini vacation. The only national emergency in America right now is one of leadership!!
yes Your's along many others, sorry for your loss. Build the wall and make it really high.
no So sorry for your loss...RIP...
no an illegal immigrant killed my brother in law  back in 1968 in his back yard when he had a celebration party for his son's deployement to Vietnam    they hit him in the head with a lead pipe crushing his skul after they were told to leave,
no Wow ppl are stupid lol
yes #RealNationalEmergency  https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/huppke/ct-met-family-separation-border-children-trump-huppke-20190211-story.html?fbclid=IwAR2yVnMDpq_1q_KufgMFmVW60-QCzUyPO_WiyfcdFWpYR991wILjADYFpLUAmerica, the kidnapper: Likely thousands of children still separatedchicagotribune.com
yes Thru...
yes We need the wall now, not a year after court debates.
no President Trump knows what he's talking about,build the wall you need Mr.President.
yes Trotting out the victims of crimes by immigrants DOES NOT make your case.   You are a pathetic user.   For once in your life, have some class.   MAGA=RESIGN.
no Dave Callender maybe you should have died in that accident then you would have some ground to stand on for your argument like the other family's that have lost family to illegal alien's.  Think man they break the law when coming into our country and break the law after they are here. You go to their country's and break the law. See what happens to you.
yes It really amazes me that there are Millions of people in this country illegally and people don't think that's a problem.
no I cant wait for the Democrats to also use the declaration of emergency to enforce gun control.  Statistically it's more of an emergency.
no Tax all the money that is sent out of the country via remittance.  Just a 40% tax on that money should pay for the wall quite easily.
no Maximus, shouldn't you be out mowing some lawns?
yes 1 year ago. #msdstrong  How many children die from gun violence? Declare THAT emergency.
no God bless you sir sorry for your loss might have been prevented if people had guts and backed trump
yes Tim Masters or the Dems could have approved barrier $ like they did for all previous presidents.  All politics.
yes Mary Langan what??
no Ayse Boykin  .... YOU pay taxes?
yes Love you Mr. President. #MAGA. Time to #ENDBORDERMADNESS
yes Americans drink and drive, too.
no Let me do something to make it up to you...  https://youtu.be/o6zBw2DUlFc
no Build the wall for all those precious lives taken by these criminal savages.
yes If we keep giving illegal folks welfare they will keep coming.  Take away the incentives to come the wrong way. Give incentives to those who do it right.
yes Pat Meacham, Trump leads through fear? Have you listened to democrats?
yes How can Anybody put a Price Tag, on Lives that will be Saved with Border Security??
no Build it, build it now!!!!
no #JimAcosta
yes Emil Drr no message received???
yes Firstly, let me start by giving my deepest condolences for losses. Immigrants are people too. So you're saying your pain would be easier to cope with had your loved ones been killed by an american? Make me understand the logic here.
no I am all for trump trust me! But signing the bill we got raped
yes Please let me be your friend
yes and what about all the mass shootings in America?  American's killing Americans.  How will you get a handle on that?
yes Remember that this pretty girl is AMERICAN just like you. Why isn't it the other way around, an illegal was killed by a pretty young American girl. You will never hear that.
yes Symone Nelson-McKnight read the comments
yes Schumer and Pelosi and the Democrat party in Congress ARE an enemy to the Country.....
yes Because that has worked so far?  They do nothing! Let's declare some more sanctuary cities!  Oh, and forget about the children trafficked through that border each year
yes Lynn Limauro Floyd How sad!!!! Yes,  BUILD THE WALL!  YOUR SON'S DEATH SHOULD NOT BE IN VAIN!  WRITE PELOSI AND SHUMER! WRITE MANY LETTERS! GO TO THE PRESS!!!! NOT CNN THOUGH....THEY WILL TWIST THE FACTS AND WILL EVEN BLAME YOUR SON ...OR EVEN YOU!!! OUT WITH THE DEMONCRATS! OUT!!!!!! THE ARE TREASONOUS!
yes Get it done, no matter the resistance, just get it done. We have your back.
yes Yeah, the ones that is legalized!!
yes When can I play golf with you?  I'll pay my own travel expenses.
yes Thank you president Trump
yes Alepo Serrot God doesn't bless idiots
yes For every American killed by an illegal alien a Democrats family should pay the price. It's all about bringing it home to these untouchables and balance.
yes Every day illegals are arrested in Atlanta for stealing, selling drugs or I think you knew I meant meth, I guess I am not perfect. Suffered stroke and brain and fingers aret together working.
yes Do you Demtards even know what the word precedent even means???
no Hussein Obam needs to explain his Whabbist /Zionist agenda. Get 9/11 reinvestigated now and expose Hillary's ties to Huma whom she wanted to grant more power after her election. Thank goodness she lost.
no i just dont understand how people dont support the wall. we have walls everywhere. weve been using them to keep INTRUDERS out for damn near forever. do you not use walls to keep your home safe? do you not lock your door to keep intruders from entering ILLEGALLY?? why is this such a hard concept for yall to grasp? it makes perfect sense.
no YES BUILDBTHE WALL
no Trump has no shame.
no The criminal trumpleforeskin is going to prison.
no Can't wait for future presidents to call national emergencies on healthcare, global warming, and gun violence.  Thank you for your overreach and creating this  new process of bypassing Congress.
yes Just as i thought. You lil fkers dont care about americans.
yes Brett Gibson Brett Gibson And they're darkies!! 1
yes #Trump2020  #BuildTheWall There is no doubt Trump solidified his second term...the man is unstoppable!
no And you support Trump BC, so gullible  https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/nyregion/trump-new-york.html
no Yes we have enough crazy here in the US, don't need to import more garbage.
yes Mr Trump, in a perfect world, wed have you as our prime minister in Sweden. Unfortunately, we only got a socialistic welder. 
yes Even one Angel mom is too many
no Blessings to you Mr president
no Dale Montri
yes Tomek Jasinski built that wall!!!
yes Estefania Torres Restrepo California  LARGEST INSANE ASYLUM IN THE WORLD  Interesting that the LA Times did this. All the others are staying away from it. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, this should be of great interest to you!  Just One State - be sure and read the last part...  try for 3 times.  This is only one State... If this doesn't open your eyes, nothing will!  From the LA. Times:  1. 40% of all workers in LA County (10.2 million people) are working for cash; and not paying taxes. This is because they are predominantly illegal immigrants, working without a green card. (Donald Trump was right)  2. 95 %of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens.  3. 75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens.  4. Over 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers.  5. Nearly 35% of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals; they are here illegally.  6. Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages.  7. The FBI reports half of all gang members in Los Angeles are most likely illegal aliens from south of the border.  8 Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal.  9. 21 radio stations in LA are Spanish-speaking.  10. In LA County, 5.1 million people speak English; 3.9 million, speak Spanish. (There are 10.2 million people, in LA County.  (All 10 of the above facts were published in the Los Angeles Times)  Less than 2% of illegal aliens are picking our crops, but 29% are on welfare.  Over 70% of the United States' annual population growth, ( and over 90% of California, Florida, and New York), results from immigration.  Also, 29% of inmates in federal prisons are illegal aliens.  We are fools for letting this continue.  HOW CAN YOU HELP?  Send copies of this letter, to at least two other people.  To 100, would be even better.
yes Thank you President Trump for all your hard work to keep us safe...
yes Same way your ancestors did
yes Worley Michael Lol shut up your kind don't know what fascism is...hint: It's not when your side loses an election and decides to engage in a corrupt witch hunt against a duly elected PoTUS.  Is that why it's been revealed they have NOTHING to link Trump to Russia? Mueller is a threat to our Republic and needs ousted.
yes You should not have signed that bill. I hope you have a plan... because that bill does everything they want. It reduces ICE funding and limits their operations. Why did you sign that????
no Build the wall! So many jobs and money wasted on illegals.
yes If gates and walls dont work,why do people live in gated communities?
no Your highest priority is yourself...  your meme failed...
yes Philip Mueller, why dont walls work? If they dont work, why do we see so many all over America?
yes Some activist judge is supposed to tell The president of the United States what an emergency is. Where is the worthless supreme court to take this matter up directly.  Considering the fact that you have four activist liberal hand puppets on the Supreme Court for the leftist, and Roberts, I see a real constitutional crisis. Supreme court should just state that the Court does not have jurisdiction in this separation of powers issue.
no And Trump understands and cares for you. lol. Ask a farmer how much he cares.
yes Adam Jasso we should be celebrating
no TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP 2020
no You must resign immediately, Mr Trump.
yes Yeah and a dingo took your baby.
yes Round them up and deport them.
yes Gus Keller I'm sure you have. You've probably seen "mfers," step over invisible lines too. I'd guess would be easier, quicker, and a place of choice (unless you're are a Parkour practitioner)  vs. a place with wall. Similar with the "dig a hole" argument.
no Trump's the anti Christ just so y'all Kno we living in revelation an the end is near.. I suggest u all get right with ur maker oh yeah an trump
no coming over the border illegally at the rate of 60,000 a month...and not "mexicans" but all illegals, drugs, human traffickers ...it's a very big concern. are you saying we don't have laws and are not enforcing them for your concerns? or programs in place for those in need?
yes MJ  Stark what color is the dress?
yes Lord have mercy Irene Roberts! Yoi better open your mind. My question was not what is it. He has lied to you and told you that he has started. Nope. Where did the money come from ? Where is it?

I don't care if you believe me.
no George E Simpkins Jr Why did he wait?... i live in the borderlands... I know what's going on here. He should have moved sooner! I'd put the Marines on the border! 2 yrs...

no Complete the Wall!!!
no So very sorry
yes Geez--of course sympathy to him and I am sorry to see drumf use you for a photo-op
yes The press and media serve as a check and balance on power which is an underlying principle to our freedom. Power tends to corrupt and absolute power tends to corrupt absolutely. We need a check and balance on executive power.
no Its several times a dsy
no BUILD YOUR WALL BACK IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY BERLIN!
yes Dawn Duff what is pointless is spending over 100 billion dollars a year of taxpayer money on people that have no legal right to be here.  Why aren't you crying about sending billions of OUR tax dollars to Jordan to build THEIR pointless wall?
no Robert Dahlquist  like the emergency we are experiencing, check this out...I didnt really need to type it out but I wanna do it fast.
yes Then why did your new tax plan rob the most from the middle and lower class?
no MISTER PRESIDENT

yes Joe Hernandez
no Thank you Mr. President! Youre doing the right thing! America has your back.
yes Elena Pate   You state stay strong and the UK will prosper.  Interesting comment Elana - clearly you know something about international trade and economics that has eluded everyone else. Care to share? How will the U.K. prosper outside of the worlds largest trading bloc?   Im really interested in your reply.  The EU is the world's biggest exporter of manufactured goods and services, and it is the biggest import market for over 100 countries. It is also the world's largest single market area
yes Will you please pardon Mr. Gallagher,  Mr.President?  https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2315525691831830&id=100001232648389
yes For everyone who has lost a loved one needlessly, build the wall! Democrats, protect your loved ones! Elect people who support a wall!
yes i said this once-twice before, shoild be publicized WHY we basically do not hear much about thois crap onnour northern borders.  i know some reasons why, maybe a klist at of top reasons wouldenlighten some people that our so border does not have to be this way.  
yes Brandon Joseph Long  Mass shootings are minuscule compared to other murders and homicides done by illegals
no Hey zippy, we don't need to import more criminals we have enough of our own !
yes So sorry for everyones losses ...We so need that wall Mr Trump...
yes Why don't we protect our vulnerable citizens from being harmed? https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2019/01/28/arizona-law-gave-preference-hacienda-healthcare/2574597002/
no Hey president Idiot,  we have 60, 000 gun violence per year. Your own people are running around with red caps shooting up schools and sending bombs.  WHERE ARE YOUR EMERGENCY FOR THEM? . . https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/ann-coulter-hits-back-trump-231420266.html
no USA Today is fake news as you stated in the past.
no But according to the Democratic party it's ok till it happens to one of their family
yes https://www.kob.com/investigative-news/large-groups-of-migrants-continue-to-illegally-cross-border-into-nms-bootheel/5245796/?cat=12387-for you Patrick P. Huneault-NBC4 albuquerque. I lived there for 40 years. Build the wall.
no I believe better funding and more modern boarder patrol will help. A wall   is fiscally irresponsible
yes Yes we need it
no Kathy Smith Williams It's a joke asshole, there I can spell that huh genius!
no El Chapo's people  are Expert mine diggers
no https://youtu.be/06BE9SiWEwA
yes Times are changing! The Wall with State if the Art Technologies will really help!
no Build
yes Thank you for fighting for Americans!  We appreciate you so much
no Maureen Hersey Brown I can't believe the lack of compassion and empathy by these liberals.  They say, "who cares?!"  Wow!  And, the other lame garbage they put up is so mental.
no Donna Davis Nice picture. I could have mistaken it for Kermit Gosnell's abortion clinic.
no Please Build that Wall!!!!
no Where was the illegal murderer from?  What country?  You know we grow our own criminals in this country.  Were any of the kids killed inn school shootings?  I believe all of the shooters were born and raised in the United States.
yes Build that wall. MAGA
yes Another shooting in America. The shooter is a legal american : https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47261314
no Simon Kitson Simon says...stupid things...
yes The McDonalds in Costa Mesa has to have an armed guard now!!
yes Prison walls will keep us safe from you.
yes The wall is being built thanks to our President Donald J. Trump.
no Democrats want open unsecured borders.  They also want no voter ID.  Democrats also know 8 in 10 legal and illegal immigrants vote for Democrats.   Democrats realized this affect in California elections...and now control that state.  Democrats cannot be trusted, criminal intent.
yes Strong, effective border is absolutely necessary if we want to prosper. End exist as a nation.
yes Illegal aliens people they are not  immigrants.
no Charlesetta Brown CNN/Money stated that Obama oversaw the worst recovery in the history of the US.  Only president to never see 3%+ annual GDP and that was with the Fed keeping interest rates at 0% for almost all of Obama's 8 years.
no Diane Smith I know alot of people that  were democrats that are going to vote for our POTUS,because they have seen how the democrats have lost their minds. I was a Democrat up untill Obama got elected. I'm so glad I'm for a party now that has common sense instead of stupidity,love for our country instead of trying to destroy it.
no Bill Rahbine no need for hunting , they quick w/ dah shits .  they will kidnap you & torture you .
yes You my not care about this until it hits home.
yes If a president can go golfing hours after declaring a National Emergency, it's not a National Emergency.
yes Diane Edwards Linton how many suicides are committed with a gun? Sure. Take away the guns. And then you end up committing suicide like my childhood best friend did when we were in 8th grade. Hung himself by the road for everyone to see. Gee..maybe we should ban rope too?
yes Shame you dont mean that...there will be nothing left if you dont protect what we need..https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2019/2/15/1834958/-Federal-judge-dismisses-butterfly-sanctuary-s-restraining-order-Trump-s-bulldozers-roll-on
yes Has Mexico changed their name to Democrat's? Then yeah Mexico is apparently playing haha
yes Estefania Torres Restrepo political gain how about safety....using the deaths to show a secure border is necessary!!!
no Enjoy the omelette bar during this national emergency.
yes you should have been more up to date on current affairs then and you would know why...smh
yes Fact: No Republican has EVER had an abortion.
yes Serious question: How is a wall going to prevent DWIs or reduce the immigrants who legally came to The U.S. but illegally stayed? The only wall that exists to any magnitude is a landmark, not protection of any kind, as it was thousands of years ago. Weve made boats and planes since then.
no Sorry, an illegal immigrant. Otherwise, the entire situation is the same.
yes Trump I appreciate your efforts and you are not pts"DISORDERED" for being reputationally assaulted! It's pts INJURY CAUSED BY TERRORISTS AND JUSTICE CURES IT
yes I think people are so caught up with being against building the wall that the whole idea here is being lost. Replace those words with enhancing security and see how you feel then. If someone broke in to the school your child attends youll be the first people saying How could that ever happen? Where was security? We pay all these tax dollars for what, so our child could be at risk where they should be safe? Or youre at a mall and someone bursts in and starts open fire. Youd be the first people demanding better enhanced security.  This wall is being built for SECURITY to keep the majority of the illegals out. If you are from a foreign nation and want to come here do it the right way. Get proper documentation, medical clearance, working papers, etc. Nothing good is coming out of illegals sneaking across the borders. Lets spend the money to enhance security (wall)  now so that money can then be spent to help the homeless, sick veterans, people who cant afford health coverage, etc, etc, etc who are American citizens instead of continuously paying for illegals who quite frankly, do not deserve to be here.  Has anyone heard of the quote You can pay now or pay later?  Well, Im sick of paying later. It hasnt done us any good. Solve the problem now so we can take care of our own problems on our own soil for American citizens sooner. #MAGA
yes What about the people killed my homegrown terrorists in America. There's more murders committed by them
yes Stop killing innocent people in Indian occupied Kashmir , shame on Indian army
yes Iain McGuire if your referring to Churchill thats obvious I was referring to a man like him smart ass
yes Maureen Hersey Brown  You are a moron if you believe that
no trump doesn't give a rats ass about anybody but himself. What we know for fact is he is; a criminal, thief, serial adulterer, sexual assailant. He may also be a treasonous traitor.  https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/cummings-says-new-evidence-shows-trump-attorneys-may-have-misled-n972341?cid=sm_npd_nn_fb_ma
yes Build the wall and protect it with lethal force just like the Berlin Wall was
yes nothing trump says is right.
yes You are all ignorant stupid humans .really so dumb the reading some of these post is so embarrassing.
yes How did they get into the country?
yes BUILD THE WALL !
yes Donald j trump is the least intelligent person
no You guys raped the Mexicans along time ago REMEMBER
yes Tudy Anderson Latulip true. And on 9/11 Congress agreed with President Bush because that was a real national emergency.
yes Sunny M Oko here some do too.
yes Yes, we know that illegal immigrants killed a lot of people in America and Canada but one of them was DONALD TRUMP grandfather who lived in America and Canada illegally and had illegal business where when he left to GERMANY he was refused his Germany citizenship and one more thing is Donald Trump used illegal immigrants to work for him because he couldn't afford to pay American workers now this is the guy lying to you? you just have to believe him, if you guys can promise him that you can vote for him even without building a wall and tell him to stop Emergency or shutting down the government may be he can because what he really wants is to be re-elected as United States president not United shshshshshshs of america.
yes I hate your a$$!
yes You are a ConMan
yes Pls don't involve yourself in topics you don't understand.
yes Christopher John I got it! Some don't get humor Christopher?
no Americans must donate funds like we Pakistanies Donating funds for Dams in Pakistan. Best of luck.
no Apple Rivera Im sorry this happened to you but someones legal status doesnt make a lick of difference when it comes to their character. This couldve easily been an American citizen. Im sure there are thousands of stories like yours that involved people who have legal status.
yes Edward Lavelle
yes we need to hold politicians accountable. Treason,  aiding in illegal activity
no Yes,  I agree Border Control & Gun Control, 2 very important issues!  Let's work together on this to save American Lives!
yes Tom Barker no that was Obama. Check your mental health status asap.
yes So very sorry for the loss of your lovely daughter. Thank you for supporting President Trump.
no We finally have a president that cares above the people in this world should've been put up long ago we would not have had so much crime
yes Dear President Trump, thank you!  For many years, we were lied to.  We never questioned our Government, we always believed that what they were doing was the right thing for the American people, when in-fact it wasn't.  I, myself was blinded by their lies and the media help hide those lies.  I never knew how much evil and hate was hidden in this world until you became President. It's a shame how people act, let alone can't see for themselves that we were, have and are being brainwashed to spill out this hate, and it's even more heart breaking that they can't see how the Democrats and certain Republicans can't be honest.  Their main goal is to one day take our rights away. It's even more heart breaking and sick when people agree to kill an innocent child.     Looking back over the years, I noticed that when someone is finally wanting to do good for the American people, they question you, they tear you down, they call you names, they call you a liar, etc., but when evil and lies exist, we say nothing. Insane!!!  Anyway, thank you for opening my eyes to the truth, thank you for being you, thank you for giving up so much when you didn't have to, thank you for standing strong, thanking you for all that you do.  My prayers are always with you and your family, President Trump.    
no The Gov Kills Millions of Americans a day
no Hi
yes This is tragic and I pray for the father & his family.  Spreading hate and fear that all illegal immigrants are dangerous is also disgusting though...
yes Yes Build the Wall !!
yes I wonder why all the border security experts say a wall won't do much....hmmm...
no The more people that speak out the better especially the people that live close to the border and see what is happening.
yes I don't pay much attention to Numbers.....I talk to People and Look at the way people are Living.....
yes Why do they have fiveheads?
yes Marcus Rech MS13 is an AMERICAN gang, fyi.
yes Pearl Brown Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR
yes What about people who was saved by illegal immigrants. If you decided build the wall believing that you will be safe after this. You are wrong. Yes you have to do something with illegal immigrants but not with this way. Way with hating them. Sorry for my English. And I'm not illegal immigrant
no Juanita Craner
yes Alex Dahlen source it yourself... look at the shared expensives of the EU
no Helped with China for 500 years.
yes Just hope after the wall is built, illegals that already here dont start killing people to make everybody think trump was wrong!
no Ess Emm DeeVee no need to be disrespectful I asked a simple question.
no And you just had installed a USD50K golf simulator in the WH!! You are a stock of laugh
yes Convince  the  RETARDED  far  left.  They  dont  seem  to  care  either  way!
no Lots of white people kill people in America . What does that prove!!!!!!
yes 140 Democrats last week voted against a resolution in Congress condemning the act of allowing illegals to vote in our elections.. While they've been screaming foreign interference, they've been the ones to admit it. They found nearly 2 million non citizens on the California voting registry. That's right, they are indeed, after saying they weren't, allowing illegals and non citizens to vote. That should be Trump's next EO. The only thing Cali agreed to do, was to remove the 153,000 dead voters on their roll, but they insist on leaving illegals, and non citizens registered. I don't know how this hasn't already been stopped, but the entire party, other than maybe Munchin, should be arrested, and brought up on  high treason charges
yes A US police officer killed my ex, we should build the wall so Americans like him cant get out and ruin other countries lives.
yes Peter Richards omg....please tell me you were being sarcastic....33% is 1/3. 31% is pretty freaking close...no one could be that stupid...right??
yes Absoutely correct.
yes Walls don't work if we still let them in, provide money, an education to their children in their language, free health care, citizenship to babies born here and finally the right to vote
yes YES !
no What about white citizens in South Africa.. stuff here is getting outta hand with all the farm murders.. it's being kept away from the news etc.. please, is there a way for amnesty.. I've worked on Carnival Cruise lines for almost a decade and would love to live in the US.. People are so kind over there
yes I'm just wondering.....do people live under rocks? How do you not see the damage illegal immigrants do?
yes How will you protect us from the thousands of American criminals already inside??
no yes sir finish that great big beautiful wall of securiy,safety and protection of our AMERICAN people .
yes The fact you politicize the death of someones child for your own agenda shows how disgusting you truly are.  This wall is about securing the far right votes for 2020.  You confirmed it when you said I didnt have to do this as in declaring a National Emergency, Con!
yes I support our president, Donald Trump!
yes Bull O'Neill HHS officials acknowledged that federal officials lost track of almost 1,500 migrant children in 2017 after they were placed with adult sponsors.
no What about all the school shootings by Americans? Those just dont matter? One problem by an illegal immigrant and thats your excuse?? A lot of worse things happen and theyre not caused by the people youre blaming. Youre doing more damage to the country. Money doesnt make you any smarter..
yes Carol Flores and over 2/3rds of those are related to mental health. The statistics account for self harm and suicides as well. The vast majority of the rest are gang or street violence by people who are illegally in possession of the arms.   Depression kills more than violence and alcohol or tabacco kills more than both.  Opioids too...
yes Danny Jones 30 years ago I visited your country I was expecting to see a quaint London  instead was barraged by Muslims who surrounded my table as soon as I pulled out my American passport to show a French girl who wanted to see it. At that point I had to pretend I was Mexican and spoke all Spanish. This was 30 YEARS ago. I can't imagine what it's like now.
yes 100 million dollars worth of water bottles instead of actually fixing the damn pipes. FLINT NEEDS CLEAN WATER.  but you dont care
yes But real national emergency is gun fires. Are you safe? No.
no Does this mean that when a man from la kills a man in Arizona, la will be walled off to to stop murderers? Wonder how America will look in ten years if that becomes the trend.
yes Shayna Franzetti
yes Our Country needs to stop listening to Democrats that lie to keep the border open. Their deceit has created the problems we face today.
yes THANL YOU SO MUCH FOR PUTTING US FIRST .YOU ARE MY .HERO, GOD IS GOING TO BLESS YOU.
no First of all, I have sympathy for these people trying to find a better life but the US cannot continue to take care of these people.  It is costing us billions of dollars monthly now.  Can you imagine the cost if we allow droves of them to come as these caravans from central America are coming?  Once you let some in, nearly all from those countries will be here.  We have our own needy to take care of and doing a somewhat shabby job of that.                                  How many are you willing to sponsor, Art?
no Yes he is My President....and I love him
no very sad
no Well Mr. President,  your new tax reform fu*** middle class income such myself. Please reconsider if you want the middle class votes next election.
yes This was a jarring week as Trump declared a national emergency after Congress refused to fund his wall  perhaps his most brazen authoritarian act yet. Trumps predilection not to govern, but rather rule by an unprecedented executive fiat, set off alarm bells for Constitutional separation of powers, as Trump departed early Friday for a weekend of golf at Mar-a-Lago.  This week the Mueller probe made news as reporting indicated Trumps former campaign chair Paul Manafort discussed a peace plan for Ukraine and handed off internal polling data in a secretive meeting to a business associate with ties to Russian intelligence, and a search warrant revealed Roger Stone was in direct contact with WikiLeaks while interacting with the Trump campaign  both in the months before the 2016 election.  At a Trump campaign-style event in El Paso, a BBC cameraman was physically assaulted by a supporter  symbolic of Trumps continued attacks on the media and his stoking of hatred against marginalized communities. Trumps speech in El Paso and his declaring a manufactured emergency in Rose Garden were both a repetition of disproven lies and exaggerations, as Trump continues to propagate a dystopian alternate reality and act unilaterally.

yes at least trump delivers
no How can Democrats live with themselves -0let alone view the photos of reality
yes The Secure Fence Act of 2006 (Pub.L. 109367), also labelled H.R. 6061, is an Act of the United States Congress which authorized and partially funded the construction of 700 miles (1,125 km) of physical fence/barriers along the Mexican border. It was signed into law on October 26, 2006, by U.S. President George W. Bush, stating "This bill will help protect the American people. This bill will make our borders more secure. It is an important step toward immigration reform."[1] Bill H.R. 6061 was introduced in the House of Representatives on September 13, 2006, by Congressman Peter T. King, Republican of New York, passing 283138 on September 14, 2006.[2] It passed the Senate 8019 on September 29, 2006
no You  are  have my  condolences.  The  government  have
yes I support the wall. Build it. Trump 2020 %
yes Yes, we must!!
yes Pretty girl
no And we all need to start carrying guns to protect ourselves and our families.
no I don't understand why President Trump did not declare this an emergency two years ago when he could have done more and got more money without a fight? Now it will be the Democrats fault and his base will fall in line with that  like mindless sheep
no I have 3 daughters and can't imagine the pain of losing a child. I'm so sorry for the loss of your child, your beautiful daughter. My grandmother and grandfather both came to this country legally. I support Trump and I support the wall. We welcome anyone, just do it the right way, the legal way. I don't understand why people have such a hard time with that.
no Apple Rivera bullsh!t stupid bot.
no Romain lettuce killed 25 people last year!  Lets ban Romain lettuce!
yes Weak boarders, equally weak Country.  Make America great again.  Great and strong. Amen.
yes Yes then vote all Democrats up president Trump needs to throw out swalwell hes  threatening to nuke Americans for not giving up our constitution deal.with this now Americans vote out Democrats
yes Joseph Nowik TRUMP 2020. Sad our representatives don't care about America.
no So sad. We need the wall
no Walls work  USA USA Trump 2020
no Ina Maitland no the wall is not wrong . We have children dying every few minutes from drugs brought in why cant you people open your eyes. Most people have wall and fences around there home for safety . What in the,world are you people thinkg. Maybe you just dont care about these kids and people getting hold of these drugs and the violence from it. .
yes Wait til Melania Trump says she was sexually abused by Donald Trump and his SUPPORTERS will chant lock her up...lock her up... And his Crowd is Cheering him on!!!!
no Keep doin what you are doing mr President..... I stand with you
yes Because a person willing to kill people is going to look at a wall and say oops, look at that ... getting past this would be illegal, I should stop here.
yes Declares a national emergency, also states it isnt an emergency, I didnt need to do this, but Id rather do it much faster.  And goes to Mar-largo  Im confused.   What is the emergency?  And how is your administration responding to it? By golfing?
no Impeach the liberal traitors then arrest them and put them behind bars.
no Pamela Parker well said a totally agree !!
no Faye Cbsbl Tucker amen!
no Agree, 
yes You're wife is a mail order bride you clown
yes What most of Trumps supporters need to understand is that illegal immigrants commit less than 1% of violent crimes in this country. 4 studies have been written, including one by the conservative Cato Institute, that all show this. These crimes that are committed could have just as easily been committed by US citizens.
yes Emily Neal, so you are obviously for alcohol to be completely banned, because tens of thousands Americans have been killed by people that should have not had alcohol in the first place.  Correct?
yes And an american killed my father....soooooo
yes How come we can give Israel money to the tune of around $3 Billion annually and they are using some of that money to build walls and none of our politicians complain about how they're "wasting money on walls" in Israel?? The U.S. is partially funding those walls along with the Iron Dome anti-missile system! Yet not one word about the walls in Israel from Schumer or Pelosi!!!! They are 2 hypocrites! We also gave some money to Jordan and Saudi Arabia! We give money to everyone!!!!! Enough! Secure our border!
yes Get um all out!
yes TRUMP 2020.
yes You want reroute wall money to help US citizens? How about we reroute the billions we give illegals instead. How about the billions sent abroad to our so called allies?  Im pretty sure there are tons of dollars wasted on non citizens every day. Why take away our shot at securing the border?
yes Ignoring the law is corrupt. Corruption is what really destroys countries. Places with low levels of corruption have a good standard of living.
yes Do we our money eith our family .Do far our kids social security  benefit has used during Obama era for eight years  .we get any thing .
yes Things will change when someone in the Democratic party (or someone close to them).. goes through this personally .. it may even take several incidences such as this to hit close to home .. But, eventually it will happen.
yes Alyssa Taylor he was drunk. But like I said this was a drunk idiot problem, and has nothing to do with Mexicans. Wheres all this outrage when a drunk Russian or Ukrainian who overstayed their visa hits and kills a person? Why are only Mexicans used in this way?? For political brownie points.
no I am sure Pelosi and Schumer won't send any sympathy flower!
no #BUILDTHEWALL!
no Walls don't work, they can be dug under, climbed over, even drones flown over. This is not auswitz

yes Danny Jones yeah thats the Democrat love for you We deal with every day killing everything here in the United States
yes Nice generalization
yes Go golf
no Your family members are more likely to be killed by US citizens. So then should we create walls to box every person in?  Risks need to be looked at rationally.
yes Jeff you need to put down the bottle of Muscato
yes It is estimated that American residents kill more to immigrants.Seems you are eying Elchapos funds to build the fence hence surplus to fund your bankruptcies.
yes Can I donate my tax return to the wall?
yes You are a disgrace to the human species.
no I've been saying the same thing except I'm saying trade the Democraps for the illegals and we would all be better off. After all the illegals are fleeing mostly socialist countries
yes President Trump, you should start a campaign to your supporters to donate money to build the wall.  We voted you in and support you.  I believe you have enough supporters that would donate and let us build the wall!
yes Why is yall supporting something tgats trap us all in in.
yes ... and walls cut off the vote recruitment stream.
no In Trump I trust
yes Oh, drunk driving.
no Why Adrian Vargas
yes Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher... just saying

yes Trumps a disgrace. He needs to be impeached, then imprisoned!
yes They are all about if getting rid of all guns saves one life, it's worth it..... But lets keep the illegals and push abortion up to birth and after.... Hypocrites....
yes Babi Nikki How can you be so cruel to say that the loss of her son has less concern or value or evil than another loss.  I feel sorry for you and will pray for people like you.  And I hope you never loose a child or loved one under these circumstances  And I also think that you must be a socialist communist democrat to make such a statement.  Shame Shame on you.
yes No they dont work

yes Gabriel Bergeron if you dont support sensible gun reform, you dont love the US.
yes I dont think our nation gets it,

no That estimate on what illegals cost this country appeared based on a paper by FAIR, which released an updated report in 2017 that claimed taxpayers "shell out approximately $134.9 billion to cover the costs incurred by the presence of more than 12.5 million illegal aliens, and about 4.2 million citizen children of illegal aliens" at the federal, state and local levels, with "a tax burden of approximately $8,075 per illegal alien family member and a total of $115,894,597,664."  The $116 million figure included services like health care and education, as well as spending on agencies like U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, minus the $19 billon the group concluded those who are living in the country illegally pay in taxes. But it also included costs associated with the children of those immigrants in its tally, even when they are U.S. citizens.
no ABSOLUTELY AND FAST.  No more unnecessary loss of life.
yes Keep 'em against the ropes
no Ok u need to peace make my mother real mom
no John Garrison your government makes million bringing it in, so build a wall against them while your at it.
yes You didnt say what illegal or where from
no You mean like the parents of the kids at Sandy Hook, Parkland, etc?
no I am sure you Russian Bots & Putin want to keep the feeble minded in America excited; about getting Trump's Wall of Hate.
no The President should have a meeting with Dennis Michael Lynch and work on immigration.
no Many illegal immigrants are law abiding people who provide for their families.  Then, you have these good for nothing pos that do nothing but occupy space.
no Build it tall
no David Proud It IS the point.  Gun Violence is a way BIGGER national emergency than illegal immigration...
no Why is it that when a Parkland Dad writes an editorial about gun control you won't post? Oh that's right, the #NRA gave you $30 million not to. #hypocritical #MAGA
yes Agree...build the damn wall.  One murder from an illegal is one too many.
yes We are not being disrespectful , there are people killing people down here all the time ? We have corrupt police ? We feel play a be part ? What is being done about it ? Nothing as far as we can see ? You have our support ! We need a wall ! We also need something done with the corruption ? Corruption kills people we never see , just by the action of it ?
no Justin Fox oh but the money could be used in so many other places.  Lets start in Flint for water for the people. Shall we?
yes Complete? Not One (1) effin' FOOT of New Wall has been built by this administration !
no Get er done Mr President!
no Sacramento Mendoza
yes The reason Democrats don't want walls is because they get kickbacks from all the drug cartels... That would stop all of that
no I hear oxygen turns you into a violent criminal, you guys should stop using it... 
no Flint still does not have clean water!
yes Don't let this distract you from the fact that Hector is going to be running three Honda Civics with Spoon engines. And on top of that, he just went into Harry's and ordered three T66 turbos with NOS... and a Motec system and exhaust.
no Youre the ugliest president ever
yes Charlesetta Brown dumbest comment today
yes Steven Keslar god ur gay. How about he does what hes doing
yes Whats so terrible about a wall? A wall is great, almost any other country would put armed guards that shoot on site coupled with a mine field if they had this many people entering illegally, btw look at what they do to people that enter Mexico illegally they are not put up with 2 hots and a cot like they do in the U.S.
yes We didn't cancel when Obama was (small p for ) President. He led the way for not being one
yes Someone on here is a whiney baby that reports everything to Facebook because they can't handle the truth. Walls do work and have worked for centuries.  If you can't handle the truth don't go onto these threads. People who report comments to Facebook when the comments aren't even hateful, bullying others, or threatening are violating people's right to Freedom of Speech. If you can't handle the truth get off the page and you are apart of the problem thus a whiney American Democrat. Stop making false allegations to Facebook because you can't t handle the truth. You know who you are.  If you have a door with a lock on your house to keep people out then we need a wall to keep people from Mexico coming in.  All LEGAL AMERICAN CITIZENS have the right to Freedom of Speech.  I have the right to my comments and so does everyone else. If you can't handle the truth go to a page where you will be coddled by others.
yes John Garrison they dont want to
no Did your yahweh create everything while it is everything that knows everything? If yes then your yahweh murdered this girl.
no Bad photo shop job
yes That's terrible. Instead of the wall, a better idea is to allocate resources towards stopping Nazi meth biker gangs and incel-shooters born in the US. Pay attention to stats instead of anecdotal evidence. Drunk driving is unique to immigrants, and US citizens don't do it?
no 2 Mass murders in the last TWO DAYS by AMERICANS.
yes BUILD THAT WALL...
no The President got more yays than nays I like that He is President of the USA
yes In other news another WHITE man killed multiple people
yes So very sorry . This should of never happened .
yes ^^^ but a wall will keep us safe from illegals
yes Go TRUMP I'm from South Texas and boy the wall been needed a long time
yes Deanette Christopherson Yea Im aware. But a wall would be a physical tariff. It would regulate the amount of drugs as well I
no AGREED
yes The border crisis has been going on for years and the liberal can has been kicked down the road for too many miles..  it is time to put up a wall, with entry doors called Port of Entry.  Immigration is an old white  colonialism concept that is no longer required since the unknown lands have been conquered and established.  Anything more than that is an invasion. Build the wall
yes Gods, you trumptards falling for this three-hankie story.  You idiots need to live in N. Korea. They have a very, very, very, secure southern border!  With its own dictator, you'll be truly happy there!

yes Meanwhile, he's taking money from the military infrastructure budget which will impact housing for OUR military. It's already a disaster in some areas. This emergency is non-existent! Our real emergency is getting Trump out of office. He LIES every day. Did you know he requested that Japan nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize? What a joke this unpresident is!
yes sacrafice liberty for security
no Kidon Gadol nope genius I'm not.
no No socialist POLICE!
yes Marge Hackett, legal points of entry is what I wrote
yes Stop worshipping greedy trick noise
no FINE SIR
no Trump 2020!
no Even one death is to many !
yes Thank you for all you are doing for the American people!  Build the wall!
yes And the tunnels under the wall? Will the wall stop them too??
yes Why didn't work in third - world countries?
no I'm not voting for you in 2020 either.
yes Mike Gruenfeld Oh go cry in your koolaid somewhere else.
yes Nikki Graham How do you know this? Did you read the bill? Who is your source?
yes This pisses me off
no Keith Webber Jr. = ignorant trumpanzee
yes John Gardner 300 ? I saw 64...and you want to put fake labels on people ?
yes illegal is Illegal.
yes Great leadership
yes Don't know, that why you're crying to me?
yes How many mass shootings by non-immigrants?
no when a close family member is killed these politicans will get it maybe
no Build the Wall !!
yes You will have to start reading those bills yourself ....and you should have already noticed that ...you are surrounded by traitors who fear nothing because they have always gotten away with their crimes....and it seems you will do nothing about them as well....
no Adam Somerville   Trump 2020. Absolutely. 20 years for treason, 20 years for obstructing justice and election fraud.  Not to worry,  With proper therapeutic intervention you will some day come to terms with the realization of having betrayed your country at the ballot box, handing it over to a Russian crime syndicate headed by a mentally and emotionally damaged New York City gangster.
yes Yes sir ! God bless Donald j Trump family
yes Then why does DJT allow the mentally ill to purchase semi auto weapons ? Thousands are killed by US citizens. Oh right, feeding his base on fear and lies !
yes Pretty sure your highest priority is lining your own pockets while feeding a large pile of scaremongering bullshit to gullible rubes
yes russian trolls
yes http://www.nbcnews.com/id/44206940/ns/us_news-life/t/man-who-saved-girl-says-hes-illegal-immigrant/
yes Absolutely the best President!
yes Matt Justice so are those crimes equal in your eyes? Clearly we have our own issues but dont need to import more.  It would doubly bad if they werent supposed to be here and raped.
yes An illegal alien killed my niece.
no Article IV, Section 4 of our Constitution REQUIRES our government to protect and defend our borders. If government does not, the Constitution, by virtue of the named part herein, AUTHORIZES the Free Citizens(s) to defend themselves and their state in place of TREASONOUS GOVERNMENT. **note; In NOT defending our borders, government gives "aid and comfort" to a hostile foreign invasion; and THIS, under Article III, Section 3 of our Constitution is properly labeled TREASON!  THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT, REPUBLICANS STAND BEHIND OUR PRESIDENT OR GET OUT!
yes Shane McInnes well said bud
yes Yes, Walls do work. That is why the left is fighting against it.
yes https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN1BG2V1
yes Thank you President Trump for all the great things you have done for us.
yes Lord hear our prayers
yes Well, we know there's at least one person in Washington who cares (President Trump).  Democrats couldn't care less.  Illegals are their number one priority.  American citizens are not.
yes Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
no BUILD the WALL President Trump. Its funny how the Clown Democrats Pelosi and Clown boy Chuckie don't want the wall,but BOTH of these CLOWNS have secured fencing around their houses.
yes Such evil times we live in.  Good in you Trump
yes Walls can't stop a determined immigrant, he/she can either chose to dig an underground tunnel or even climb over the wall...how about you just come up with a good policy.
yes YES SIR, PRESIDENT TRUMP! BUILD THE WALL !!!!!!
yes Walls dont bring dead people back maybe see if therapist instead or try thinking for yourself
yes Heartbreaking story, I am so sorry for this family's loss. Thank you President Trump for giving them their voice that Beto wants to keep silenced.
yes What about all of the northern States like the one I grew up on that border another country and have no walls?  It sucks that you can't find a job with the skills you have, maybe try learning Spanish or move to a place where speaking Spanish isn't a job requirement... If 45 knows things we don't that make it crisis now that is more important than helping the Americans in California or Puerto Rico then why did it take so long for him to declare an emergency? Why didn't he do so in the first 2 years of his term when he was trying to get this done? It's not an emergency if you wait 2 years... Jim Jenkins - if control laws take lives, that blanket statement would mean you having a driver's license, being married in the government's eyes, or opening a bank account take lives... there are many countries with stricter gun laws that have lower crime rates. That point on gun control laws was also just simple way of showing that if you support a wall because it could save one person's life, then you should also support guns laws as they would save one person's life, or healthcare for all as that saves one life, or a full transition to renewable energy as that saves one life... more wall is a waste of taxpayer funds if it doesn't deal with the majority issues used to manufacture its need as an emergency, namely illegal immigration and drug smuggling.  Lastly saying that relatively few innocent people are killed by a gun is just plain nonsense. Try telling that to one family members that was killed in any number of mass killings in the last few years from Sandy Hook to Las Vegas concert goers... and stricter gun control doesn't mean law abiding citizens cant own guns, it just means they have to jump through a few more hoops. You loved your wife enough to file paperwork with the government declaring it, why cant you do the same with your gun? You wanted to drive bad enough you took a test showing you knew how to do so safely and show back up at the dmv every few years to reregister your license, why wouldn't you also do the same to own gun?
no Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin 14) Energy   ~ Presidential Memorandum to clear roadblocks to construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline.  ~Presidential Memorandum declaring that the Dakota Access Pipeline serves the national interest and initiating the process to complete construction.  ~Opened up the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to energy exploration.  ~Coal exports up over 60 percent in 2017. Rolled back the stream protection rule to prevent it from harming Americas coal industry.  ~Cancelled Obamas anti-coal Clean Power Plan and proposed the Affordable Clean Energy Rule as a replacement.  ~Withdrew from the job-killing Paris climate agreement, which would have cost the U.S. nearly $3 trillion and led to 6.5 million fewer industrial sector jobs by 2040.  ~U.S. oil production has achieved its highest level in American history  ~United States is now the largest crude oil producer in the world.  ~U.S. has become a net natural gas exporter for the first time in six decades.  ~Action to expedite the identification and extraction of critical minerals that are vital to the nations security and economic prosperity.  ~Took action to reform National Ambient Air Quality Standards, benefitting American manufacturers.  ~Rescinded Obamas hydraulic fracturing rule, which was expected to cost the industry $32 million per year.  ~Proposed an expansion of offshore drilling as part of an all-of-the above energy strategy Held a lease sale for offshore oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico in August 2018.  ~Got EU to increase its imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States. Issued permits for the New Burgos Pipeline that will cross the U.S.-Mexico border.
yes So sorry for your loss!  I stand with President Trump!
yes Build the Wall High And Mighty!  Prevent future Democratic voters!
yes Yes we must!build the wall!!
no The sad situation has become a National Emergency. Please continue caring for ALL Americans as you 'Build the Wall'!
yes Among the problems in the United States, building border barriers is safe for US citizens. The foreign issue is denuclearization of the North Kim Jong Eun.  When the North Korean Kim Jung Eun, which is called the axis of evil, is removed, American citizens naturally like Trump.
yes There are too many innocent people being murdered every day and if you look at it long and hard you can see that it all is happening because there is no border wall to keep illegal immigrants out.  Weather it is from their drugs laced with fentanyl or weapons they brought with them or illegal immigrants who think the laws do not exist or pertain to them.  Build the wall and make them come through legally and catch the drugs and weapons at the port of entry!  We can't take care of our own.  Why are we still taking care of them.  The money it takes to build the wall will be cheaper in the long run from the money we save from Narcon used to save drug attics, medical, shelter and feeding illegal immigrants not to mention the loss of life we have to endure having them here.
no Linda Durbin Hes playing golf again this weekend.
yes We know the president is right. We know its the dems resisting. Sickening & so sad

no William Yip how about the walls that holds your roof up that you go home each night to be safe
yes Thank you Trump 2020.
no The wall will be built.
yes Adam Somerville A fire fighter supporting this policies. Perhaps you need to consider in changing your career pal.
yes Thank you! Now build the damn wall Push Sen. Cruz's bill for term limits thru Congress Spin up an investigation to expose how senators and representatives are becoming millionaires on $175k a year. Stop all foreign support to countries which have a dictatorship  Tactical nuke Syria and call it a day Then get North Korea on the phone and ask if he wants the same thing  You have our support....now take the ball into the endzone.
yes Ahmed Abd Elsamea what does that mean?
no Love the Trump
yes Walls just like locks only keep the honest thieves out.
no Trump
no Exactly
yes #BuildTheWall
yes Then do something about the Mass Murders. You have the power to make change, but won't.
no This is so sad.  I watched yesterday as President Trump pointed out the Angel Mom's to the people that were there and the fake media.  I did not see many of the media looking at these mother's.  Sat there looking at their phones,  Shameful and Sad!!  What if something like this happen to their family?
yes Why do you not care about the thousands of Americans dying at other American hands? You are still 1000's of times more likely to get killed or assaulted by a US citizen, but don't let that fact stop your fear mongering.
yes Carl Ostendarpnot asylum illegal immigrants lying to get asylum status deportation is the only solution
yes Sorry for your loss.   Build the wall
no No Brainer amen www.magapill.com
yes In addition, U.S.-Mexico trade has been duty free for more than a decade, and the renegotiated trade deal does not add new tariffs on goods coming from Mexico to the United States
yes I wonder if trump can land his stealth bombers on their foreheads.
no #SB13 FreeTheStates.com #IGNOREROE Courts don't make laws #EstablishJustice #StateSovereignty #AbolishHumanAbortion #CHURCHREPENT FederalBeast.com
no We also need tougher laws
yes Indeed!
no Do you mean speaking truth?
no Paul Johnson Mr Affluenza killed several people; he was legal, Caucasian and barely served any time.
yes God bless sir!
no Could it be one of the illegal immigrants working on Trump's properties???!!!... Bunch of fucking assholes#impeachthemotherfucker!#americasdumbestpresident!#fuckingmoron!
yes Laurie, get a real FB  page before replying to my comment.  Yours is fake
no God bless our Angel families. Thank you Mr. President for fighting for our future as a Soveriegn Nation. People need to be vetted and come here legally. No more freebies.
yes Thats ok with the  on the left . Kill babies unborn and already born , but dont a animal that was convicted of murder. This is Democratic Party, ok but dont bother the  that comes across our borders.
yes Kay Mike White LIBERAL males you mean, no but more people are murdered by illegals than white kids, and teh illegals can be dealt with only this way, I dont think there is a cure for liberalism sorry.
yes Yes and AMEN
yes Were all immigrants, specially trumper
no Kevin Llamas Jurez What did you want him to do...take our guns away? The socialism is strong within you!!
yes CliffandKim Ferrell   Not to worry,  With proper therapeutic intervention you will some day come to terms with the realization of having betrayed your country at the ballot box, handing it over to a Russian crime syndicate headed by a mentally and emotionally damaged New York City gangster.
yes When are the Democrats going to wake up and back Trump. Build the Wall.
yes We support our president!!!!
no The statistics say otherwise.
yes Silvia Serra Lobo But you dont need any facts apparently!  Cough up your supposed facts to disprove what he said libtard!
no Prior to 911 we didnt need id to fly... So many of these people out of the 11 million came.. Many years ago.. There not crawling threw the desert
no Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin this does not even take into account the NAFTA deal he negotiated..The part media fails to inform you of is what the NAFTA deal means and how Mexico IS going to pay.... I'll explane...  ~It forces USA metal to be used *(HUGE for American jobs and American steel sales generating billions) and it will keep automobile manufactures in the USA (worth billions).  ~Americans bought $71 billion more imports YEARLY from Mexico than vice versa. That's about to change in Americans favor.   ~At least 30% of the cars must be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour to keep American car manufactures in the USA (That increases to 40% in 2023:) Autos that don't meet these requirements will be subject to hefty tariffs.   ~Canada must open up its dairy market to U.S. farmers. It will eliminate its complex pricing scheme for Class 7 products. That includes milk protein concentrate, skim milk powder, and infant formula etc.   ~It opens the wine market in British Columbia to American wine. (Billions to America).  ~Mexican trucks must meet U.S. safety standards before crossing the border.   ~Provides more protection for patents and trademarks. Saving tons to American's who have been ripped off of their ideas & costs Americans billions and also helps reduce black market.   ~U.S. drug companies can sell products in Canada for 10 years before facing generic competition. Extending it by 2 years. (Billions generated)  ~Companies can no longer use Chapter 11 to resolve disputes with governments, they will now have to pay up instead. The only exceptions are U.S. oil companies.   ~We no longer fund Mexican abortion clinics. Exports drastically reduced, for one example sugar from Mexico cut nearly in half, creating more jobs and revenue, tourism industry hit hard, federal employees banned from traveling to certain main areas.  *Of course, Trump didn't really expect Mexico to just write the US a check as some ignorantly say as "fact" :)
no Daniel Bremmer you actually think illegals trek thousands of miles with a ladder?
yes Replace all of those a##hole  dems.
yes A white male killed my naturalized citizen friend...what can we do about that? Stop exploiting these few victims when we have true national emergencies, like another white male shooter yesterday! #Fearmongering #propoganda
yes What about the 5 Americans shot and killed in their jobs, by another American.  Guns are the emergency, get rid of guns you stop the killing.
yes But I never go to doctors for sniffles....we farmed and knew how to stop the illness of our livestock.And everything else that goes along with a lifestyle of working for others...it's not just a job.But we couldn't afford health insurance. My husband was a very successful business man but we had no control over the price of our products.I worked for nothing but insurance for the last two years of his life at a school till  he passed from a rare neurological disease at 64. Insurance may not have prevented his death,but the quality of his life would have been improved.It can happen to anyone....no sniffles here.......cause I know the difference between life and death...and what a wall can and cannot do.
yes Devon Wood - "Things" change.. Lies don't
yes they will take a plane. 400$ only
yes Of  Course we need a Wall ,We need to do everything possible to stop the Criminal element from coming into our country  ,  Right now it's very bad for our country.  Guns in the wrong hands will always be a  fact ...Are you saying Guns shouldn't, be allowed ? Americans need protection from Drugs , and , all the politicians making it a reality .. I see a Country  that is being controlled by  people like Soros , I see Our Great President Trump  trying his best to go forward with a Wall and ,security for Our America  to protect Our great Nation  .. Its time to  be proud of our country again. ( Taking  Guns from the honest man will not remove the  Guns  from the depraved  segment of society )
yes NOT ALL ILLEGAL IMMIRGARNTS ARE THE SAME
yes Oh so sad. We must protect us from evil.
no Mike Marsh yay....
no Bull O'Neill  and then why is Trump ignoring these problems?  At the Rose Garden speech..why didn't he have Parkland families there?  Explain that
yes the Democratic Party is wrong not to be backing the people of the USA.  I'll never forget their unAmerican/ungodly ways.
yes How would we know that without one?
yes I am so sorry for the most profound loss in your life.  I support the wall.
no It is no longer hyperbole to say that our president is a fascist. #thankstrump
no Debbie Bauman I'm sorry. Nothing like it. It's really tough to lose a child. How old was your son?
yes Thank you President Donald Trump, we Africans (Nigerians) are proud of you.
no Mitch Haynie ....its called the military for these types of issues not a wall buddy....
no Illegal immigrants have been killing people in Wales for hundreds of years.
yes absolutely.
no And what about the settlements of Muslims who wont assimilate and are anti Semitic and now voted into congress? Stop chain migration and mass entry through legal means!
yes Your wall is ridiculous. Please focus on a real crisis. Fulfill your promise of health care. Too hard for you to understand?
no Emily Neal we are discussing the wall.
no Amen  Build the wall
yes The Mexican drug cartels have a lot of money and they know how to invest it to maximize their illegal profits. During the national discussion in this country about legalizing marijuana it was suspected that a large amount of cartel money went into swaying public opinion away from the legalization.  Is it possible that cartel money is now being used to change public opinion and the politicians opinions on the construction of the border wall between Mexico and the United States? I am just wondering now
yes what is wrong with the dangerous Dems in Washington, they refuse to work to keep America safe, instead they are working to bring thousands and thousands of illegals here that we taxpayers have to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for their care and worse, put our Border Control agents in danger..  this is nuts.  and what's with Joe Biden, typical Dem, goes overseas and attacks Pres. Trump - what a fool,  gives a speech in Munich, how disgraceful, that is just what Obama used to do - travel overseas and attack us and our country, he always apologized for America.   i am waiting to hear if Biden will plan to run in 2020 because he needs to answer one important question - is he going to continue to take his son Hunter along on government trips so Hunter can come home doing BIG deals in foreign countries like he did when Biden was VP - Hunter flew with his father to China on AirForce 2 and made a HUGE business deal for himself. of course the US media never made a fuss over that.      https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6712807/Biden-repudiates-Trumps-policies-Munich-speech-saying-undermined-Americas-moral-leadership.html
no Amen Build that wall
yes My heart goes to the man but big fucken shame on you for politicising someone's loved one's death to gain support for you're stupid ass wall
no Whatever
no Danny Jones Time for your countrymen to stand up and rise up just like Winston Churchill did
yes Mathew Bake des he built one in oval Office with Lego Stones.  But this was it . Later in Prison He finde a Lot of Walls who surruond him. Orange is good Color for workingsuite
no I'd love to help build the wall! Trump 2020. Then in 2024 maybe we can get Ivanka!
yes Why wait til your loved one is on the list?  Stop illegal immigration
yes How many other daughters were killed by Americans?   A lot more than one. More bullshit.
yes Border security, but no stupid, expensive, archaic border wall.
yes Nancy and Chuck are murders!
no Tony Sherrard, we will leave that to the democrats
yes Ok, don't give up, build this wall, if necessary pullout ur troops from Afghanistan too. ur useless troops in Afghanistan can protect that wall.
no Turns out, unpacking the history of Russian mafia's take-over of Fred Trump's territory + watching the 2016 online activities of Roger Stone's khaki-pleated neo-Nazi Incel tikitwats = front row seat to treason.
yes WALLS DO NOT WORK.  Stop using victims as props!
no God bless you Mr. President!
yes Wally you don't give a "rats ass" about anyone but yourself !!
yes How many times will the Democrats turn a blind eye to the needless deaths of American citizens in order to protect illegals?!
yes Do you want a wall? Boarder Protection? You got it for all your life savings with 10 easy payments  including shipping and handling.
no Well we all know it wont stop it but it will HELP ALOT
yes Keep going Trump.   We agree with you! We will no longer appease these awful democrat traitors hell bent on destroying America.
yes John n Morris and maybe you need to call 1 866 go Jack off!
yes How many deaths are attributed to illegal immigrants in the past calendar year? Now compare that to gun violence in this country by our OWN citizens? Ill wait....
no Charlesetta Brown Printing money every day was so easy for him...
yes You have some nerve
no Hat about Parkland and the thousands in the US who were killed by male citizens.  That seems to be an emergency
yes Americans killed 35.000 people last year in America. Wake up voters.
yes 39 mass shootings this year (4 or more people shot) none by illegal immigrants, would the wall help that?  Too soon? Walls didnt keep undocumented workers out of Mar a Lago. Maybe Pinocchio was too busy campaigning to notice.
yes How about the parents from Parkland shooting!?!?
yes Stay the Course Sir... MAGA!
no The death and loss of of one American in this silly context cannot be excused. Build the #$@# Wall!
no Keith Webber Jr. Many National Emergencies were called prior to President Obama (why you all bring up Obama and Clinton all the time...get over them...focus on now)...but did Obama want to take money from the military or drug intervention programs? Trump himself ...in the Rose Garden... said..after he declared a National Emergency....he didn't need to do this now.
yes Obama? Lol
yes To all the people that want illegals in this country sponsor one put your money where your big-ass mouth is
no Eddy Coulson, why are you such a shithead? I suppose you want to open up the border and abort babies "you people" should be aborted starting with your mother after all she had defective children. I bet you are Gay..........here a picture of your mother and your brain.........
yes If everyone  wants  to  see  results  start flooding  the  democratic leadership in the Congress and Senate members with e-mails and  phone calls  pointing this out.  Next election  time  reminded  them of  their  complicity in the  deaths  at the hands of  illegal people at the  polls,  and if you are not registered to vote,  then on Tuesday  go to register to  vote.  For the truth  is  that  most Democrats are  hypocrites. Nasty Nancy Pelosi has over 25,000 homeless people in her district,  los Angeles  has 58,000 homeless people yet they refuse  to address that issue,  but they will gladly  allow illegals sanctuary in their largest cities  and  financially  secure  services  for them.
yes Walls won't work, cause' we are constantly evolving to our surroundings, and the last thing we need is a flying Mexican
no Ed Wrany how. About. All the people. Idiot brings in. To work at his golf. Course. McConnell brings in. Hundreds. Of. Taiwanese. Because his wife wants them here

no So sorry  the way you lost your daughter is such a tragedy. We must declare that those who want to harm Americans must be kept out !  We must secure our borders and defend our Nation ..... so sorry for your loss
no More trump Bullshit:    The Actual Facts about  'Murder and Extremism in the United States in 2018'  'ADL, EXECUTIVE SUMMARY'  'Each year, ADLs Center on Extremism (COE) tracks murders perpetrated by all types of extremists. The 2018 Murder & Extremism report provides key insights into the crimes, including motivations behind these violent attacks.  2018 was a particularly active year for right-wing extremist murders: Every single extremist killing  from Pittsburgh to Parkland  had a link to right-wing extremism. Among this reports key findings:  Every year adherents of a variety of extreme causes kill people in the United States; ADLs COE tracks these murders. In 2018, domestic extremists killed at least 50 people in the U.S., a sharp increase from the 37 extremist-related murders documented in 2017, though still lower than the totals for 2015 (70) and 2016 (72).  The 50 deaths make 2018 the fourth-deadliest year on record for domestic extremist-related killings since 1970.  The extremist-related murders in 2018 were overwhelmingly linked to right-wing extremists.  Every one of the perpetrators had ties to at least one right-wing extremist movement, although one had recently switched to supporting Islamist extremism. White supremacists were responsible for the great majority of the killings, which is typically the case.  Deadly shooting sprees were a major factor in the high death toll. Five of the 17 incidents involved shooting sprees that caused 38 deaths and injured 33 people.  The perpetrator of one of 2018s deadly shooting sprees, at a yoga studio in Tallahassee, was connected to the misogynistic incel/manosphere movement. In the wake of this attack and a similarly-motivated killing spree in Toronto, Canada, ADLs COE now tracks such incidents as extremist-related killings and has updated its database to include an earlier incel-linked incident, Elliot Rodgers 2014 shooting spree.  Firearms remain the weapon of choice for extremists who kill. Guns were responsible for 42 of the 50 deaths in 2018, followed by blades or edged weapons.'  https://www.adl.org/murder-and-extremism-2018
yes you are a small percentage do not need 5billion sorry facts
no Its amazing to me how no one acknowledges the fact that the root cause of the accident is a DRUNK DRIVER, not an illegal immigrant.  Maybe we need to bring back prohibition
no Yes Trump is right, n he cares enough to take all the hot wash from his enemies to make us safe!!!
no Alexandra Ica Hanciu what genocide  lol
yes I agree withvmr. Trump. The wall must be built.
yes You will notice on these threads that conservatives engage in logic based, constructive dialogue, while most of the emotion, and misinformation comes from the left? What does this say about the people being voted in by the dems? I just don't meet very many smart liberals out here in the real world
no If the illegal doesnt get into this country, neither does his gun he carrys
no I am a different kind of person, you see if one of those rat hole bastards were to kill one of mine. I would hunt him down like the dog he is and would burn him very slowly to DEATH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yes Illegals killing our people is only a very small majority why don't you people look at the facts
yes Ed Wrany you are a donkey he shut the government down for 35 days and put government workers with out pay grow up he is a baby if he can not get what he wants
yes Trump is protecting you and I so why would anybody go against this hardworking country loving and God loving President?  I stand with Trump because he genuinely cares and has out performed every President that has come before us in my lifetime.  President Reagen was great and Trump was by his side.  Thank you Trump!
yes A crazy white guy killed my father, and walked away with no jail time. His name is Bobby Guthrie. The cops were so overwhelmed they got it confused with an incident that happened on the near block so no one was there in time. Evidence was missed and ive looked so the guy walked if you want to put a massive amount of money somewhere put it in the police force. A wall wouldnt have helped my family.
yes Worley Michael   Haven't you heard???  Russian collusion and the Trump campaign, ZILCH, ZERO, NADA, NOTHING!!!! NO EVIDENCE OF RUSSIAN COLLUSION!!!!   LOON!!!!!!
yes God bless the dad.
yes Copy pasta

yes THEN LETS DO IT....BUILD THAT WALL
yes Nah democrats want to ban guns already..Liberalism is really a mental disease.
no Fully support Donald Trump The safety and prosperity of the United States is above all "We need a safe wall" The Democratic Party will pay for this wall construction project I say Democrats will have to spend money on this wall   "The United States needs security, not Democratic Party."
yes Donald J. Trump is guilty of fear mongering and incitement. His removal from office won't come soon enough.
no Thank you for putting America first.
no Que love TRUMP PENCE for ever the best our hroe  l
no Dummycrats only think the rich deserve walls
yes I suggest you step down Mr Trump, forcing a bogus national emergency upon America is something I know you know what you are doing and thats why I am calling it out but many don't get it and likely won't. Perhaps that is why you have gotten this far.
yes Jeremy Harbolt dont lock ur doors then....
yes Julie Albers Hampe I guess if you like drug traffickers, child trafficking, and gun smuggling then thats up to you.
yes So why did Trump sign a open border, amnesty bill that incentivizes illegals with children to come here and is predicted to culminate in the biggest surge of illegal crossings ever? Sorry Trump you betrayed us and unless you have a plan to rectify these laws asap, I'm off the Trump train
no Just shows our politicians only care about power and money. Donald can only be in office for 4 more years then it's back to the same old.
no GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP.
no yehaaa build that wall, a uk supporter
yes Trumps fake emergency is a sign of weakness, not strength.  He ran on the wall, he had two years of Republican control of Congress, and he still couldnt get it financed. Weak president!  #OrangeMoron #WeakPresident #SeanHannityLapDog
no Charlesetta Brown the recession was in 2007 and 2008. He did nothing to end the recession. It was the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates to 0.
no Build that wall!!!!
no Just say no to caravans ....BTW !!
no Huh a couple of Americans put the  Middle East into the heap of mess it is today. You don't see any of the Arab nations banning you folks. While I do deeply feel sorry for your loss, I do also think that such a generalisation isn't something to be trifled with...
no Linda Gayle Hutson is good they are doing that to the president
no YES THEY COME HERE BUY CARS AND DRIVE WITH OUT LICENSE MANY THINK AGAIN OUR PRESIDENT DONALD  TRUMP IS TRYING TO PROTECT OUR LIVES HE IS FIGHT AGAINST TERRORIST AND IN LEGAL PEOPLE ISIS AGAINST DRUG SMUGGLING INLEGALS I VOTED FOR TRUMP WILL AGAIN IF I AM STILL ON EARTH LIFE IS SO SHORT TRUMP HAS DONE MORE GOOD  THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT    HAS SINCE KENNEDY
no and theyre on a steady increase now...60,000 a month
yes Bullshit as usual the wall will definitely not work waste of money
yes Danny Jones Don't listen to the bigots here. My second moms is in the UK and trust me I hear how bad it is. Takes a good heart and some bravery to sat what you did. You're very kind and I truly hope these hateful people do not take your sunshine away
yes Are you stupid?  You're definitely confused; You confused  Obama and transgender wife Michael with President Trump and First Lady Melanie. You really should stop smoking that pipe, come back to reality, start drinking coffee. Wake up. Find God and support the truth not like Obama the father of all lies. Keep in mind(,if you have one, or can find it) that Trump is not a politician, and is the main reason Trump is President. Politicians lie honey Trump has proven himself to be a man of his word. BTW take those CNN blinders off and be apart of the solution not another liberal liar supporter of Globalization. It will be here soon enough with out your support.
no Amen my brother, we're with you, build the wall.
yes Thank you President Trump for your dedication to secure our border and protect the American people!! We trust you, stand with you and support you 100%. We know you have our best interest at heart.  God Bless You and God  America!!! #TRUMPPENCE2020 #FINISHTHEWALL
yes I believe a investigation should be done on Nancy and Chucky on there financial background and see where all there income comes from!!!
no NOT BUILDING THE WALL HASN'T WORKED SO WHY NOT TRY IT. ATLEAST TRUMP IS STEPPING UP AND TRYING TO DO SOMETHING.
no BUILD IT!
yes You .... are a country made of immigrants ....
no Lmfao he has a joint Facebook account with his wife who TF would've ever guessed that he'd be a snitch
no Tim Masters if the tradgedy happened to you would you feel the same? Doubt it
yes So sorry for all the angel families.
yes Don't Americans kill fellow Americans daily? Are we gonna build a wall around them too?
yes Janet Woemmel-Spicer
no The deepest swamp in the US is the corrupt Trump family - that's the national emergency
yes Funny you should mention El Paso...isn;t that the city with some kind of wall that was put up on the grounds it would way lower crime rates...but the city was already among the safest in the country and its wall didn't lower crimes rates...?
no You lie. You couldnt care less for Dems and you cant help but blurt it out every day.
yes Beverly Harris but they come in illegally. And bring in drugs and gangs
no THE WALL WILL BE BUILT!
yes We have to have a wall ...Do you want this in your neighborhoods ???
no Happened to my family too
yes BS!
no Terry G. Taylor if you are an American you will be chosen for the job after they have filled their illegal obligations.  They past really does repeat itself
no Create an executive order that all democrats have to tear down the walls around their homes and must accommodate illegal immigrants.
yes Trump not keep nobody safe,because all the people in DC will not work with him. All you do carry your gun and protect yourself.
no Hitleresque propaganda is fucked up.
no http://www.coolstuffinparis.com/le-passe-muraille.php Make the wall awesome
yes Loretta Sleavensky yes!!! Keep the gun toting Americans out? Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher.
yes Bullshit. You declared an emergency then went on vacation
yes Well,,my husband died from poor medical treatment...no walk was gonna give me good health insurance.
no Another point of 'illegal' immigration is the impact it has on our economy. I'm a construction general contractor, I have seen so many people in my industry struggling to find jobs or decent wages due to the influx of people here illegally who have infiltrated our construction job markets. This is taking jobs away from sovereign citizens of the United States and most of them send a large portion of their income back  to whatever country they came from, hence, depleting the monetary circulation of our internal economy... Build the wall!
no Just keep doing the great work you have done for two years. We see it, appreciate, and thank you for it.
no So sad we deserve to be kept safe
no Why are dims against it, before they voted for it?
yes Build The Wall High And Fast President Trump. The Real American People Are With You Sir. Thank You For Saving America and Her People.
yes Liberal stupidity is rampant.  Hey Libs you get to scream at the sky on Monday at noon!!
yes Sir my condolences but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver. Are you part of Mother Against Drunken Drivers. In that area many have been hit or killed by drunken drivers- what is being done?  Dont Drink and Drive
yes "Illegal Immigrant" is just a nice way of saying criminal,,There are thousands of people in prison for lesser crimes.
yes And the victims of Orlando, Las Vegas, & Marjorie Stoneman Douglas, what do they get? Oh yes, thoughts and prayers aka absolutely nothing.
yes Stop with the lies already, walls don't work and they won't keep us safe. We're not paying for a billboard for you to plaster your wife raping pedophile face on.  https://www.cbsnews.com/news/border-patrol-agents-have-discovered-at-least-230-cross-border-tunnels-since-1990/?ftag=COS-05-10aaa0h&utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&utm_content=5c4a8a3b3ed3f00001512fb6&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=facebook&fbclid=IwAR0J1uIo9b_RhMR7yskRM-q317Sbv-UDsQZzMNNAPr5VkHJgWt52L3d2xOU

yes trump 2020 build the wall
yes How many lives do we need to loose before people realize WE NEED THE WALL!
yes People dont realize that these people coming here the wrong way could be criminals. Also they try to bring drugs over in turn kill our loved ones.
yes Cut the cash flow and they will go! Mandatory e-verify, voter Ids, end chain migration, cut off the freebies like healthcare and welfare and free education from sanctuary cities Donald J. Trump
yes Tim Masters right and Congress over the years handing power to the executive branch is the problem too.  They have to take back what they got lazy about and handed off.  Executive branch can now create laws and regulations all on their own in different departments
yes AND THEN SHOOT TO KILL ANY ONE TRYING TO JUMP OVER
yes Another challenge for our President.  Presidenc Trump has broad shoulders and perseverance, HE WILL BUILD THAT WALL.
yes Stefan Beukman
yes I do not even know how the demorats  sleep at night  oh yes they have no soul,  I'm  so sorry  for  all of you that lost some one to these illegal s  May God bless and comfort  you all
yes Lisa Mann A Wall will make it much more difficult and time consuming than just walking in.
yes An illegal alien who had been deported 7 times killed my best friends ONLY child along with another young girl that night. He simply just snuck back in every time. Cant help but wonder if it hadnt been so easy to sneak back in if those poor girls would still be here.
yes The dictator is a fascist and and a crook and will be in prison soon.
no What about the hundreds of families who have lost a child to gun violence in their schools? Why do you not own their pain?
no Id feel a whole lot safer if trump was behind a wall... preferably outside the White House, out of power, and without twitter.
no Alberto Venditti certo..
no Luis  Lpez Good luck with that! Smh
yes You haven't convinced the people , and you haven't convinced congress . You declared your national emergency already, now let's see how you do in courts ... So Stfu about it and move on to other issues .
no What a lot stupid people behind a stupid president the rest of the world is in panic
no Ryan VanBuren , very weak argument
yes All for the wall!!!!!!!
no We need sea walls.
no Amen...
no "If Trump gets any more incoherent, the right-wing evangelicals will claim he's speaking in tongues."
yes Stop giving them welfare, food stamps, free medical care, cell phones, and housing. They will stop coming. We need Immigration reform and voter ID.
yes If an emergency can be manufactured over border security when illegal border crossings are near a 20-year low then its a snap to make the case for an emergency over gun deaths, which are near a 20-year high.
yes What about the mother's that have lost children to gun violence? There are substantially more of them. Yet you do nothing about that. Why?
no Nobodys against the wall their against trump getting credit for it
yes God bless you
no Build The Wall !
no Brandyn Sutherland then take away the guns
no https://www.kveller.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-14-at-2.26.44-PM-1200x734.png
no Build The Wall.
no A Trump supporter murdered a bunch of people in a Jewish temple in New Jersey too.
no What about the school shooters? Are they mexicans?
no concentration camps are welcome in America... well apparently not in America just to divide America
yes Telling the dems, or reminding them of these tragic stories does NOTHING.  Their agenda is more important.
yes Wendi DelValle  so sorry for your loss! The peoples president has your back he WILL build the wall!!
no JOKE  An Englishman, and Mexican cartell,  and Osama Bin Laden were all in the desert when a genie appeared and said he'll grant each a wish. The Mexican cartell went first and asked the genie if he would make the land in Mexico fertile so the dope crops could flourish, and there would never be famine. With a flash the wish was granted and Mexico forever fertile. Osama Bin Laden was next and he wished for a wall surrounding all the muslim countries so no western ways could corrupt the perfect muslim way of life, and with a flash there was the wall all around the muslim countries. Next was the Englishman, he looked at the genie and said, please tell me more about this wall, so the genie said its 5000ft tall and 100ft thick nothing can get in or out, so whats your wish? The Englishman pulled out a cigar, lit it and said, FILL THAT WALL WITH WATER!
yes A bunch of white men committed mass murders in this country centuries...i dont think its a wall we need
no God bless America. God bless Trump
no Please build the wall. We are with you Mr. President Donald J. Trump
yes TRUMP IS A JOKE!!!!!!!! TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE A BUNCH OF IDIOTS!!!!
yes Sharon George Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher.
no So sorry for your loss Sir.  May she RIP.  Yes President Trump truly cares about this country and all it's citizens..  It's the democrats and socialist who want to take over
yes Any of you bleeding heart lefty libs wanna ask this man, or Kate Steinles dad, if they think there's a border crises!!?? I didn't think so you hypocrites!!
no Should have been a clean DACA for the Wall bill.  Thats fair.
no THE POPE LIKES HIS WALL!!!
yes Anyone who opposes securing our southern border is a traitor this nation!
yes I hate this argument.  Don't get me wrong - America should get her beautiful southern border wall...  But this argument is entirely emotional - there is no rationality to it whatsoever...  Then again people are emotional beings - this kind of message may be an essential part of a rhetorical arsenal.... but I still hate it...
yes If walls didn't work why do all those demoasses have walls around their homes. The United states can not take on the whole world at one time. If the wall allows that, build it.
yes My father was also killed by an illegal immigrant on February 17, 2017. We must have the wall and deportation!
yes Cheryl Bowler Schrager, you mean its despicable for anyone to tout gun control by using victims as props?
yes https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/2890714002
yes May Our Lord, Thy God Almighty in Heaven continue to Bless you President Trump and all the Trump family in continuing to MAGA and One Nation Under God blessing you in all ways and forever in your life .

no #BUILDTHEWALL #NICEANDTALL #THANKYOUMRPRESIDENT
yes Henry Bilboa I saw about 3 or more posts of Americans killing people and sexually trafficking kids. I didn't tag you either.
yes People love addressing every negative encounter theyve had with anyone that looks Mexican.  Can we address police killing people along with mass shooters?  Pretty sure those problems arent gonna be solved with the wall
no BUILD THE WALL!!!!!   STOP THE INVASION!!!!    No amnesty.    Get in line like our ancestors did!!!
yes That's because he wasn't a pregnant illegal alien. They can get free Medicaid along with their anchor babies!
no Useless Democrats don't care.
yes Lets bring the rest of the world up without collapsing our civilization!
yes Betty Bilbrey Exactly.
no President Trump is making a bill for DUI,, criminal offense, best president ever Trump 20 20 
no Triumph comes not by force but by wisdom. A strong wave will bring ruin to what it touches but in its wake you've discovered a cleansing of the shores...
yes Throw........ MS. Nope already got trump getting dump over the wall and let the Spanish and cartel take care of him. Then.... Tear the wall down
yes SINCE WHEN IS KEEPING AMERICANS SAFE FROM CRIME, DRUGS, AND DISEASES A BAD THING?????  DO NOT LET YOUR ***PERSONAL HATE FOR TRUMP*** GET IN THE WAY OF AMERICANS SAFETY!! BUILD THE WALL !!!!!!!!!
yes I have a good feeling that better days are ahead!

yes www.sultan.org
yes HERE ARE THE NUMBERS WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND: Yale University released a study (October of 2018) by three researchers, all of them liberal I believe, who concluded the actual number of illegal aliens in this country is not 11 million--it's north of 22 million. Twenty-two million.  The Democrat Party is now, as a matter of policy, calling for the legalization of ALL illegals in this country, citizenship voting rights. 22 million new voters. The overwhelming majority of first-time immigrant voters vote Democrat.   The largest margin in American presidential history was 17 million votes in a 1984 election between Mondale and Reagan. 17 million. You would add to our voter roles 22 million at least permanent electoral majority, in perpetuity.  That's what this (this insane resistance against President Trump and his call for building a southern border wall) is all about. It's not about making the country better, serving our labor needs, and helping the population. It's about putting Democrats in power, FOREVER.

no What will you do when a white man shoots up your church then?
yes Adrian Dahlstedt We were already great! Trumps a scam artist
yes Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin 16) Defense  ~Executive order keeping the detention facilities at U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay open.  ~$700 billion in military funding for FY 2018 and $716 billion for FY 2019.

no No because the money set aside for Homeland Security in the future will only be raided by Democrats and used on welfare, abortion and the climate
yes Sorry
no Dawn Duff trump troll indeed.
yes For the safety of all Americans build the wall!
no Should built a roof too since most get here by plane...
yes One life lost to someone on our country illegally is one too many.   Stop the madness.  Put Americans first
yes What about all the us citizens that have done all those shootings I don't see trump do anything about that but yet he is doing so much to but a wall that won't work
no So sorry for your loss.  It should never have happened!
yes Even if you dont get the wall built youre still gonna win 2020. I dont think the Democrats understand how many people are against late term abortions !! That alone will get Trump reelected.
yes Those white inner city shootings in Chicago are out of control
yes Yeah...such an emergency.  That's why it's taken him two years.  And, he's only getting 55 miles.  You Trumpers are the dumbest species on this planet; what's left of it.
yes Very sad situation, however, violence from illegal immigrant pales in comparison to that of school shootings.
yes they feel special and don't want to stand in line
yes Trump needs tofuck off   hes a self serving bastard
no "WE STAND WITH YOU MR. PRESIDENT"
no Ok Mr. President you are truly great at fear/hate mongering, how about you do something presidential now.
yes just look at britain if you dont believe him, we are fucked
yes This our last chance under President Trump Build that Wall & abolish the Democrats God bless you President Trump now you know how Custer felt at the little big horn we are with you all the wall .
yes Timothy Kershner So we should import  more criminals illegally? That's a old weak talking point!! You my friend are the one that need to shut up!!
yes No.   You are wrong.   Perhaps we should ban WHITE men/boys because of the mass murders they committed.  The Las Vegas murders, the Miami murders, the Parkland school shooting, and let's not forget Timothy Mcvey (sp) etc...etc...  I think a white man just killed five co-workers and injured fire police officers...mmmm
yes LEGALIZE CANNABIS! ! ! THX
yes You should not have signed the Omnibus Bill that you just signed!  What were you thinking; this only made our battle worse and gave more rights to illegals.  Not happy with you Trump.  The wall is only one part of border security.
yes Secure our border and prevent criminals from being exported to our shores
no In a sense, the wall merely represents the Trump administrations worst instincts and desires. It is harmful, wasteful, and offensive, but an ineffective wall is nonetheless better than the surge of 5,000 new Border Patrol agents and 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to round up and deport people that the president also wants. No wall has ever arrested, robbed, battered, or murdered nonviolent people, as immigration enforcement has. A wall will not create an interest group to lobby for itself, endorse nationalist presidential candidates, and demand more power and funding, as the Border Patrol union does. The wall is more than a symbol. It will harm the lives of thousands of border residents and immigrants while wasting billions of tax dollars. But in a world run by nationalists, the one small source of comfort for non-nationalists over the next four years may be the knowledge that it could be worse.  -  D.  Bier - Cato Institute
yes Denise Paige  if the border is over 2000 miles long 200 miles of wall won't do anything they will have 1800 miles of no wall to still come across.
yes PUT UP THE WALL!!!!!!!!!
yes President Trump thank you for fighting for America. The low life cowards in DC never saw you coming. Wish more of the Republicans new how to fight so you wouldn't be alone in this dirty street brawl. Though our history certain men were born to accomplish great things and I think you were so burdened
no Trump is a terrible president and shouldn't have been one. I would rather take my chances with Hillary than with trump. He had a tantrum like a 2 year old child over a wall he didn't get so he she the government down, he got rid of Obama care, and he also forcefully took kids away from their parents. That's not making America great again like every one thinks.
yes Thank you for the emergency declaration to build the wall, President Trump. TRUMP2020. MAGA
yes Propaganda
yes AGREE
no Teresa Pagniano where did he get his first dose?
no Nazi's used propaganda like Trump does to condemn the Jews. Demonizing an entire group of people for the crimes of the very few is never justifiable.
yes Excellent Mr President
yes https://www.facebook.com/341163402640457/posts/2436705443086232/  What about this you fucking clown????

no Listen up. It is written.  No question about it. The wall is necessary to secure our borders and protect the Nation of United States of America and its population.  Sir, excellent decision. Lets finish the wall necessary to secure our borders and protect the Nation of United States of America and its population.  Israel re-built there wall in 52 days during the Bible OLD Testament time with no modern tools as we have today in the 21st Century.  Nehemiah 6:15-16 New Living Translation  The Builders Complete the Wall  15 So on October 2d the wall was finishedjust fifty-two days after we had begun. 16 When our enemies and the surrounding nations heard about it, they were frightened and humiliated. They realized this work had been done with the help of our God.  Definition of enemy plural enemies 1 : one that is antagonistic to another; especially : one seeking to injure, overthrow, or confound an opponent 2 : something harmful or deadly alcohol was his greatest enemy 3 a : a military adversary b : a hostile unit or force  http://biblehub.com/nlt/nehemiah/6.htmbiblehub.com
yes Send this snake to Satan!
no Mike Charles wall
yes MISTER PRESIDENT! OVER HERE
yes " 'I didnt need to do this,' President Trump insisted at a Rose Garden appearance on Friday, as he declared a national emergency aimed at shaking loose a few billion dollars in financing for his beloved border wall.  "The presidents assertion was both ludicrous and self-defeating. If a declaration was unnecessary and the wall on track (the wall is 'very very on its way,' the president said earlier in the week), how could he claim to be addressing an emergency? As Mr. Trump explained it, 'But Id rather do it much faster.' A presidential desire for speed does not constitute a crisis  no matter how eager a president is to camouflage his failures." - NYT Editorial Board  "This weeks bipartisan spending bill, which contained no more wall money than the one over which Mr. Trump shut down the government in December, was a particularly humiliating defeat.  "Desperate to save face, the president and his team cooked up a nonemergency emergency with the aim of seizing funds already appropriated for other purposes. Currently, the plan is to pull $2.5 billion from the militarys drug interdiction program, $3.6 billion from its construction budget and $600 million from the Treasury Departments drug forfeiture fund. The White House plans to 'backfill' the money it is taking from the Pentagon in future budgets.  "And so, in a breathtaking display of executive disregard for the separation of powers, the White House is thumbing its nose at Congress, the Constitution and the will of the American people, the majority of whom oppose a border wall.  "Even as he spun this as an act of strong leadership, Mr. Trump acknowledged that his declaration resolves nothing and creates a host of legal, legislative and political troubles." - NYT Editorial Board  https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/opinion/trump-border-wall-national-emergency.html
yes What will president hannitys next order be????
yes Yet you do nothing to stop people like the Aurora shooter.
yes Peter Darling, way too funny! Dwindling base??? Actually, according to RCP, Trumps average approval is only 1% below his highest. See below for the truth   Poll	Date	Approve	Disapprove	Spread RCP Average	1/25 - 2/14	43.6	53.6	-10.0  Rasmussen	2/12 - 2/14	50	49	+1 FOX News	2/10 - 2/12	46	52	-6 Economist	2/10 - 2/12	41	57	-16 Reuters	2/6 - 2/12	39	57	-18 Politico	2/7 - 2/10	45	51	-6 The Hill	2/7 - 2/8	47	53	-6 Gallup	2/1 - 2/10	44	52	-8 CNN	1/30 - 2/2	42	54	-12 Quinnipiac	1/25 - 1/28	38	57	-19 All President Trump Job Approval Polling Data  As far as Manafort goes, all this narrative about someone who was sent to prison over something that wasnt even a part of the 2016 campaign. Amazing!
yes waiting 2 years to declare an emergency is hardly addressing an emergency if he waited until after he didnt get his own way to call it , he just needs to keep his base happy so he gets a second term
yes If you would like to report illegal aliens, please call Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at 1-866-DHS-2ICE (347-2423). They will need to know names, locations (either work place or residence) and any other specific information you can provide. #BuildThatWall
yes They will help a lot
no Krishna Shree Jones Jebaraj country  should be protected from capitalists, liberals  and conservatives and especially white superamascist patriarchal men. Do that america does not need a wall. Since trump is a white superamscist he would spray hatred on Asians and Mexicans.. infact majority underpaid exploited unorganized sector is of these people. Before building a wall one should realize who has built america .
yes Resign!
no What culture?
yes This is so easy to solve this problem. No wall needed. Just stop giving them free EVERYTHING and they will stop coming.
yes How many were killed by USA  Citizens, with GUNS yesterday ???
yes Paulo Americo Rocha very few attempt crossing the desert it is a very long and arduous Journey through train that most of the year will kill you from dehydration in less than a day.  I assure you it is much easier and more common for someone to hop in the trunk of a car then it is to cross the Sonoran Desert.
yes I support the wall and the great things this man is accomplishing. In the public eye and outside the public eyes. Your a true patriot Mr. President! And America needs you!

no Petion is online to impeach Pelosi and Schumer!! Sign it!!The wall needs to be built! Charity starts at home! Take care of our citizens first then help others! We give money to many countries billions start here first!!!
no President Trump can you have the new Attorney General and the  DOJ  investigate if El Chapo gave millions of dollars to Clinton, Pelosi, Schiff and others? I'm a concerned American  citizen and veteran  that has been hearing that he did, but he was silenced. Thank you for Making America Great Again
yes I agree!!
yes Last year, a Canadian man stabbed a Michigan police officer.  Donald J. Trumps failure to declare a national emergency and fund construction of a wall along the northern border is inconsistent with his recent assertions to the American people.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1GY00I
yes Dems seems to forget about all the people affected by illegal immigrants. From murders, robberies, illegal driving to identify theft and all the companies who pay illegal immigrants under the table to avoid paying taxes. These people who come in illegally cost the US billions of dollars.  But dems would rather let them in to illegally vote in elections.  We need to be safe!  Walls work!
yes DAMN..RIGHT THEY WORK...ITS TIME TO CLEAN OUT THESE ANTI AMERICAN DEMOCRATS
yes the real American emergency! https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/16/us/illinois-aurora-shooting/index.html

no Especially in the vulnerable areas!
yes Thank you President Donald J. Trump for protecting the USA as your highest priority! We the people appreciate all that you do!
yes Yes Sir!!
yes Chris Jensen
yes Not to minimize what this poor father experienced.  What are you doing about the real emergency of thousands of children being murdered by guns every year? Cant wait until we get a real president again.
no Jo Sechi Surely you're not implying that deaths caused by illegals are less significant because they are fewer than gun related deaths? And to go all the way back to 1968 to inflate the number? How many gun related deaths last year? This year so far? How many of those are outside Chicago? Don't preach to me about gun control. The number of American babies murdered since 1968 far outnumber the American lives lost to guns. SIT DOWN.
yes What about protecting our kids and families from shooters like yesterdays,  Illinois shooting?
no Ed Wrany worrrrrst president there ever was!! Worst than the second bush!!
yes I can not beleve that this new democrat party has as many supporters as they do . I think every single nut case in this country are the only people supporting them . mentally ill voters are more dangerous than mentally ill gun owners
yes Build the Wall Now.
no Ron O'Hearn  Whipping is cheap and effective, you can even train animals with a whip.  It's actually the way I was trained to have respect for the rules.
no President Trump 20172025 As you said in your SOTU speech,  "If walls are immoral and don't work,  Why  does bitch pelosi  have a wall around her multi million, dollar mansion "???  Thank you God's  speed and God bless America and  your family,    Indict  bitch clinton,

yes Having incompetent Presidents in the past has cost us all......about time someone was looking after those who do the right thing
no Janie Rogers Doss  yep!!
yes Wow this is insane
no Lauren Vaden
yes It's literally a fact that native born people are more likely to be violent than illegals. Again I'm not for allowing a free flow of illegals. Just the statistics
no Timothy Kershner that doesn't mean every illegal is now ok. That is the 0000.1% of illegals.
yes Larry Martin .. I don't have to ask anyone, he's done more so far than many past Presidents and that's even while having to deal with all the bogus accusations and investigations. I'm certainly sure that he's doing more than what Hilary would have done!
yes Wall and electric fence +drones with guided missiles please President.
yes Texting while driving is one the principal causes of car accidents in the world... lets build a wall around cellphones too
yes BUILD THE WALL NOW!!!
yes A completely useless death and a travesty of justice. Is Beto willing to allow his kids to be victims?
yes It must be 25th amendment, 30.
no Linda Durbin; last post 5/15 Comments are full of these revived, foreign, & newly created Facebook accounts to show support for propaganda and spread discord.
no I cant get over the fact because an illegal took your loved one makes your grief heavier then mine, a broken heart is forever, in some ways mine is worse, guns are passed out like candy in this country, if my grandfather was shot by an illegal Id be saying how the hell did he get a gun?but because he was a citizen everyone said its his right to own a gunI will never defend the right for all the crazy people running around with guns, look what just happened in Illinois a sicko killed 6 co workers and injured 5 cops, build a wall that will protect from mass shootings, gun violence the real threat to this country
yes Sorry for your loss. I agree we need the wall
yes The Parkland shooter was a native-born American the killer in the factory in Illinois was a native-born American not immigrants 8 billion dollars for wall is stupid when people in California have burned homes to the ground when people in Puerto Rico are struggling still America can help not only at home but across the pond Haiti Venezuela wake up Trump better yet get out
no Now hear this there is no national emergency at the southern border when the president is off playing golf and of story no wall... Sorry for your loss
yes mARXIST cOMMUNIST LEFT =jEWIISH INTERESTS
yes What about mass shooters? What about drugs flowing into the country at the ports ?
yes I want to donate... Is the link legit?
no Many have been killed by shooters who were citizens.  We have a gun problem.  I
no A legal citizen kills people everyday.   What idiots
yes The Great Hoax of Open border (ILLEGAL) Immigration Policies will be exposed by history as one of the most evil and corrupt actions by our Capitalist Political Establishment. It benefits those with capital who want to employ cheap labor. Our middle-class and low income disproportionately suffer the ill effects and social burden of this sick self serving policy. Thats assuming all illegal immigrants we welcome here arent criminals but just good people appreciative of the opportunity to bare racial and economic discrimination for the many opportunities USA provides. Criminals, Gangs, Terrorists, Social misfits and Powerful Transnational Crime Organizations are able to exploit this horrible policy to our detriment, again overwhelmingly disproportionately affecting the middle class and poor. The people who all these lying politicians have been saying for decades they care about and work for. POTUS Trump is working to force common sense immigration reform because he truly does care about Americans and our country. Controlling our borders is essential and the easiest place for him to begin this reform. 
no Danny Jones  The 39 billion is the divorce bill that we HAVE to pay to the EU.muppet!
no Who is going to protect us from homegrown domestic terrorism?
no YOU ARE THE BEST PRESIDENT EVER.

no Democrat communists dont want to make America better they want to make America worse so they can hidr their crimes
yes Jo Sechi , Still dont want  Illegals here period. And dont want more gun controls. You have to realize that good Americans dont commit gun crimes. And according to the department of Justice more deaths are committed by hammers than rifles in the US, so pick your poison and believe what you want. Gun laws infringe on the 2nd Amendment. And ban Shaiah law Nationwide too.
yes Trump On!! WALL!!!
yes trump!! great man
no Wat if they come by tunnel? Like how Pakistanis entering India .
yes An American full blooded shoot my grandfather to death, dead is dead

yes Yet, you probably thought Sandy Hook and Parkland were hoaxes, right?  And, even if not, you don't think gun control will make a difference, right???

yes No one but this great man could withstand the abuse and the lack of support and still accomplish the unthinkable. Youre a warrior, sir. We thank you and we love you. God is with you. In my 74 years, no one even comes close
yes Cathree Gori like the government assistant loving red states?
yes Angel Roy and guess what?Have built walls to keep bulls from breeding  other people's cattle!!!Broke down walls..... can't stop an animal n heat .
no "No matter what you do, drug trafficking will never go away, and one of the reasons for this is that the US is the largest purchaser of drugs, I'm not the problem, you are" ~ Chapo Guzman  ....he's right you know. 
yes I have more problems that would make people like you scream mama. But I' m a disabled vet who gave an oath to protect my country when only 18 and 40 years later that oath is as strong as then. You want to talk about money that could be used instand of a wall. Then lets take your money and pay for all the death cause by the illegals and for all the pain. Want about the over Crowded schools the medical thats payed for by the american tax payers. And don't forget the money that's payed out for the useless democrats in washington. Get some commen sence.

no This is definatly a spirtual war we are fighting in this country. Wars get very bloody but we are ready!!!!! Majority of America stands with our PRESIDENT We  have never had anybody in office that would stand for the people and stand rock solid like Trump has done!!!!! All through God's word, he sought out for strong, courageous, faithful at heart for His cause and places them in postion. NOBODY could have ever withstood such flaming darts from the enemy as Trump has. He is definatly planted in this position by God. Even the great Moses became weary, Exodus 17:12.  (Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.) President Trump, we are your Aaron and Hur!!!!! Your supporters are your armorbearors!!!!! We support you and also take alot of poisonous darts everyday for this great country!!!!! The left is not of God and most of us know what we are battling. We lift you, your wife, family and your administration high and lifter in prayer everyday. Gods WALL OF protection around you all.

yes WOT SOUND DO THE FOXES MAKE ?? NNNNNNNNNNN BUM BUM SOSAGES
yes The "stable genius" is so dumb, he doesnt even know that weather, and climate are different things. He is so dumb, he cant close his own umbrella, he is so dumb, he mispells Hamburgers as hamberders. If you read a transcript of ANY of his speeches, they make no sense. Its gibberish. He is the worst speaking President in history. He is so dumb, he doesnt believe in science. He is so dumb, he believes 99.9% of the world's scientists, are playing a climate change hoax on him. Im sorry, but if you believe Trump over every scientists in the world, youre probably dumber than he is. If you have been alive 20 years, u cant tell me that winter is the same as it was 10 years ago. He ignores these facts bc he personally makes money off natural gas and oil. He has a motive for denying science. His supporters have no excuse besides being gullible, and stupid.
no Roy Norwood it's over your head Roy, don't give yourself brain free.
yes Steve Martin I'm sure you will not be calling it a false alarm when it affects your family and children. The Angel parents know it's very real. You'd think you would be funny having that name.
yes By proxy the democrats that oppose the border wall killed her by their inaction on our security.
no YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE.... THIS BS OF USING ILLEGAL HAS GOT TO STOP.....ILLEGAL IS RHETORIC THAT SEEMS OFFENSIVE TO OTHERS....!!  I'D RATHER WE SAY..UNWANTED,  UNDOCUMENTED..

TO ALL BEINGS HERE THAT BROKE LAWS.... WE ARE DONE SUPPORTING ANY OF YOU.....!!!  LEAVE.....! GET OUT...AND DON'T COME BACK....!!!!
no Hmmmm...What about the unborn being aborted and torn apart EVERYDAY IN AMERICA! ..... Shouldn't we be saying, a DOCTOR IN AMERICA KILLED MY SON OR DAUGHTER!.. Plus, he was, PAID FOR IT! WAKE UP AMERICA! It's NOT a choice!
yes So when the wall does nothing to cut the crime rate in America, he will have to point the finger at another group of people. So be safe and don't belong to any group.
yes #Resign Donald J. Trump
no "If Americans who Hire harbor or give welfare to illegals were imprisoned for 5 years you would not need a wall or even a fence"
no Are you talking about killing indigenous people of America?
yes I with President  Trump  100%
yes So one daughter is worth more than 14 kids in Parkland?
yes https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/51112586_10218015968013047_144837176373280768_n.jpg?_nc_cat=1&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.xx&oh=403cf388720000ae216aa974a9f098ad&oe=5CFA0718
no So what about the killers here in the U.S. we will never have a safe Place without killing they're all around u WITHOUT u even knowing until they get caught up...
yes Kimberly Danik We need to move on...Obummer did his dirty work, now we have to do EVERYTHING in our power to fight back, make America stronger again whatever it takes, so join American organizations, make new friends and strengthen the bonds of old friendships, buy American, support all things American, vote for Republicans across the boards, and run for local offices whenever possible, have meetings, conversations, celebrations, f2f positive interactions with anyone and everyone and discuss what is happening in our country, encourage each other, write letters, sign petitions, get involved in your local schools, churches, Vet groups, hospitals, nursing homes, etc, etc, this is the way we are going to #bebest, to achieve what the POTUS asked of us in his SOTU speech, to be excellent in all we say and do, and to unite for the sake of our future. I personally am going to become a foster/adoptive parent now, and hope to influence many kids over the next 10, 20 30 years or however long I have, caring for them and teaching them all the great American values that will enable them to become great citizens of our great country. Also, I have started to write down any pertinent names, info, addresses, email, phone #'s and I contact the appropriate offices, when I learn about any person, entity, politician or group who are doing anything I feel is harmful to our American way of life and freedom. For instance I have been writing, calling and signing petitions to have traitors such as Rashida Talib and Ilhan Omar and also Linda Sosaur ousted from their positions, and at least bring attention to them that shows how many citizens want something to be DONE about their slanderous and evil words, behaviors and deeds. It has to stop, and the majority of American citizens feel this way, or else Trump would not have won the election. There are MILLIONS of us who can do these things that I am talking about, and these are respectful, legitimate and peaceful ways to get our point across and to get results. I hope you will join my efforts, thank you and may God be with us! 
yes How about this: at you next rally and press conference about the Wall, you display large photos of everyone killed by an illegal with their date of death printed on them for ALL the press and people to see.  To finally drive a nail into the idiots that refuse to see the need for the Wall.
yes Sylvia Grimes so you turn your back on your family don't tell me you don't have family in Mexico all Hispanic do in family if you look into your family back ground .

yes So sorry for your loss. Yes President Trump needs to finish the wall!

no Im so sorry that these Dems dont give a damn if you lose a loved one its only about their agenda nothing else! Pray to God that these evil people will come to their senses
yes Dave Callender Moronic comments.....
yes Don't back down Stand your ground We pay taxes for protection and we demand and deserve it. Thank's a lot Democrats,Hollywood and bias media.I'm sure everyone knows some one who over dosed on fentanyl lace heroine.It's killing Americans and 90 % of it comes over the southern border and so does 75% of the heroine. Think about that every time you stick up for the Democrats.Build the wall or let more kids die,plain and simple.
yes https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-sanders-2020-vermont-senator-says-hes-running-for-president-in-cbs-interview-political-party-views-stance-on-issues/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7e&linkId=63780371&fbclid=IwAR3PN47LJmaDhkbswmR7pSrKTobg7gSaak-DunLk8qoauxh9XxhXyto20G4
yes Thank you!
no A white guy killed over 50 people watching a concert in Vegas...whats being done about that other than my thoughts and prayers....
yes By that logic, an illegal immigrant saved my life. We need to tear down any type of border.
yes Just like the demo leaders using shootings to further their gun grabbing bullshizz??
no I totally agree Janine!
no The real threat is Americans. How many immigrants committed mass murders is United states? 0!
yes What about the shooting in Aurora? I guess you only politicize violence when you can manipulate it to support your own fearmongering.
no Go Trump maybe we the people need to go down together build the wall Gov support the supplies
yes You are the greatest President, I know you can do it the best you could for the Americans citizens people to build the wall for our safety. We need the wall for stopping illegal immigrant crossing to our border by saying that my son's car got hit by ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS and the car he drove NOT even registered on his name.
yes Its a presidents #1 responsibility!  Build the wall and increase ICE AND BOARDER PATROL FUNDING!!!
yes They are some strange aliens. They cant be from this world.
no Ruben Palomo I don't see the relevance...
yes who killed those FIVE people in Aurora and FIVE in rural Texas ? Don't they count?
yes He's under 17 criminal investigations.  Nothing great about him.
no https://www.facebook.com/groups/384296842094377/permalink/508906516300075/
yes And who would be the first to blame President Trump if an illegal killed one of their family members because a homicidal immigrant walked across the border without detection because there is no deterent like the wall.  Hypocrisy in the highest form Demwits!!!!
no An immigrant saved my brother from being robbed
no Thank you, President Trump! Walls Work! The Democrat Party is void of sustainable ideas that attract voters -- so they have been importing them -- actually paying them to come with taxpayer money. A country without a border is no country. Congress should repeal Senator Edward Kennedy's un-American immigration law. We want the world's best and brightest if they swear allegiance to our country only and to our Constitutionally protected Liberties. Most all the rest should work and go home, just like foreign laborers in every other civilized country, until recently.
yes Jim Thornburg background checks aren't the problem  , they steal them or buy them off the streets
no So sad my prayers for them
no So are abortions, which is worse ?
yes https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-took-putins-word-over-us-intelligence-on-north-koreas-icbm-2019-2
yes so sorry for your loss. I agree with you for many reasons
yes Wall by itself isn't enough We also need to be learning fluent spanish and some dialects so we can hear trouble coming. It would be Really Nice if a clear enforcement partnership existed with the Mexican government, too.
yes That is a sad story but it has nothing to do with the wall or a "National Emergency".
yes Chuy Jesus Santy sunday comics isn't a history book , go to the library and grab a real book
yes If I was a Mexican criminal, why wouldn't I go north?  No wall and sanctuary City morons will even protect me!
yes We also need Congress to change the laws to stop catch and release. Send them straight back if they are caught illegally. This release within 20 days because the courts so backlogged will never get fixed otherwise.
yes An illegal  immigrant  almost killed my boyfriend and father in law. Hit them in the back  made them roll 4 times and he ran!! Still got away with it. He was drinking and driving...president Trump build the wall!!!
no Someone run against Nancy in California and all her friends and vote them out of office .
no AMEN
no Statistics dont bear out this story. Anecdotal evidence is not statistics. You can cherry pick stories, but it doesnt change reality. A wall is ineffective and a waste.
no Walls do not work
yes Steve Ware whats your point? Every country has bad citizens that do bad things. Thats why we have prisons. That doesnt mean we want illegal people from other countries that also includes bad people.  We have enough of our own to take care of.
yes Linda Gurtz Hildreth big deal
no We need the wall!
no Why doesn't he care about all the children killed in schools????
no More Americans are killed in America by white Christians Americans.
yes Alyssa Marie Duran shut up
yes What kind of wall after the Vegas shooter?
no I can understand someone feeling this way if their child is killed by an illegal. I would feel the same way.   But lets look at the numbers.   106,000 Americans are killed every year by adverse reactions to prescription drugs. Thats 12 people every hour that could be prevented.  And theres no crisis or emergency for the families of those victims. This isnt even on the news.   From all available data, it appears that illegal immigrants (mostly gang members) only kill about 77 people a year in the US. Compare that to 106,000 killed by drugs or 250,000 killed every year by medical mistakes.   https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugInteractionsLabeling/ucm110632.htm#ADRs:%20Prevalence%20and%20IncidencePreventable Adverse Drug Reactions: A Focus on Drug Interactionsfda.gov
yes Bull crap. You are an idiot. Your base is a congregation of the kids who dropped out.
no Your loss is heart crushing.  I understand.  What I don't understand is WHY it is only the handful of victims killed by "illegals" are worthy of sympathy?  There are murder victims every day all over this country.  Families of those victims aren't deserving of notice because it doesn't further trump's agenda.  Why do other victims not matter?  They too are somebody's child/sibling/parent.
yes Yes... What happens when  white kill  Black.. Hispanic.. Asian. Same white an kill Police officers..
yes God bless you.
yes So sorry for your loss.   WALL
yes For more than a century, innumerable studies have confirmed two simple yet powerful truths about the relationship between immigration and crime: immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes or be behind bars than the native-born, and high rates of immigration are associated with lower rates of violent crime and property crime. This holds true for both legal immigrants and the unauthorized, regardless of their country of origin or level of education. In other words, the overwhelming majority of immigrants are not criminals by any commonly accepted definition of the term. For this reason, harsh immigration policies are not effective in fighting crime. Unfortunately, immigration policy is frequently shaped more by fear and stereotype than by empirical evidence. As a result, immigrants have the stigma of criminality ascribed to them by an ever-evolving assortment of laws and immigration-enforcement mechanisms. Put differently, immigrants are being defined more and more as threats. Whole new classes of felonies have been created which apply only to immigrants, deportation has become a punishment for even minor offenses, and policies aimed at trying to end unauthorized immigration have been made more punitive rather than more rational and practical. In short, immigrants themselves are being criminalized.
yes Lie
no Jamie Rochelle if we had the wall less people have to lose their families, less Americans have to grieve....but you dont care about them....right?? Until that illegal goes and gets drunk and kills your family....we dont hear about that because they dont collect that data.
no If the wall saves only 1 innocent life it is worth every cent.
yes Walls won't stop this, and you ignore this emergency.   https://www.abc15.com/news/data/mass-shootings-in-the-united-states-when-where-they-have-occurred-in-2019
yes So true Donald Trump
yes Socialist DDR build a wall in Berlin. It did NOT work.

no Maga!! Build the wall
yes MANY MILLIONS OF AMERICANS AGREE WITH YOU. WE MUST BUILD THE WALL FOR AMERICAN'S SAFETY.
no Send the military to California and build the wall.
yes Lynn Limauro Floyd  firing squad is better
yes YES YES WHAT IS WRONG WITH THOSE STUPID PEOPLE GET THE WALL DONE
no Until Prisons are safe of Drugs and Crime then we should support a Wall.  A National Emergency should have been when School Kids were Slaughtered by White men with AR's.. Let that sink in Chump..
no Build the wall Mr. President, Trump 2020!
no Build the wall our country needs it for our children's future
yes Build that wall around the Demodopes
yes In February 2009, Congress approved Obama's $787 billion economic stimulus package. It cut taxes, extended unemployment benefits, and funded public works projects.  The recession ended in July 2009 when GDP growth turned positive.  In just seven months, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act pumped $241.9 billion into the economy. That increased growth to a robust 3.9 percent rate by early 2010. By March 30, 2011, almost all ($633.5 billion) of the funds were spent.   2. Modernized the Auto Industry Obama bailed out the U.S. auto industry on March 30, 2009. The federal government took over General Motors and Chrysler, saving three million jobs. It forced the companies to become more fuel efficient and therefore more globally competitive.
yes well diaper donny lied to you his wall will be tied up in the judicial system and won't get built just another one of his lies
no Oh dear
yes If there were only ONE person killed by an illegal  immigrant; the (complete) security wall should be built!
yes Build the wall way to many entering illegally.
no #SecureOurBorders
no Dave Callender How many people have been murdered by Illegal immigrants VERSUS How many people have been murdered by white Americans lets say in the last 10 years?
yes Who's going to protect America from YOU, you creep ????
no Thank You Mr President!
no a legal resident killed over 50 in vegas...wheres the wall around vegas tbh.....
no This is plain not true. Trump does not care about all of us at all. Wake up voters and see it is you he has harmed the most.
no Betsy Hammond  Yep so many more REAL emergencies than the stupid wall. What a Con
yes Yep, it's called personal responsibility and being aware of your surroundings.
yes The Democrat Party has every sociopath in the world trying to take a swing at a us.
no It's sad the left cares more about illegals than the Angel mom's. You never see Angel mom's on CNN or other leftist news shows.
no Not slow--nonexistent matt f.
yes Yes, yes, yes!!
yes Pandering to the lowest denominator as usual. All surface and no substance. I guess it work for you.
yes Including all the gun deaths that are created by Americans like in Illinois yesterday?
no I am sorry for your loss, but that American can face the charges, instead of being protected by sanctuary cities or deported,  only to come right back.
yes Build the wall. Start a go fund me page. Lets get that money and build it.
yes Thank you President Trump for building the wall and protecting the boards
no Kent Wojahn  well said!!

no U dont give a crap, youre just trying to check off your campaign promises on your white board, yeah, I read the book fear.  
yes Ted Bundy was convicted of killing 36 women. And he did so by going state to state and escaping from prison a few times. We should have border walls on state line.
no what about the kids that were killed by americans during mass shootings?
yes an Anerican shot up Vegas Strip smh
yes They have bought up an rented all the houses in every city and small town. The blacks an whites are out numbered, an they have Hispanic running for president already. What happened to the Alamo?
no When you said, "I believe Vladimir Putin" regarding the potential of North Korean missiles to hit the US, were you high or out of your mind? Benedict Donald needs to be arrested, interrogated and imprisoned ASAP!
yes Abdul Majid    Shes Legal, unlike YOU, Abdul !!
yes #NoBanNoWall
no Robert Dahlquist in some cases it can be much more. My previous job was a medical biller for a pediatric rehab where they offered speech, physical and occupation therapy. We had many patients that lived in Mexico come across every day to receive treatment that was covered by Medicaid. Basically it seems parents are having kids on this side of the border with no intention of living here, only to qualify their children for benefits. We billed over 40k a week. This particular clinic is closed now due to budget cuts, but this is going on all over.
yes Walls work throw da tards over with their buddys
yes What would u do
no No one talks about the money spent for land purchased by the prior administration for the border wall.
no not because of one dumbass everyone gotta pay...
no You,sir, are a fucking hoax!  https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-mar-lago-national-emergency-1332979
yes Yet one here will acknowledge how many times act of terrorism have happened on our own land by white males.
yes no they don't...
no Katie Hamilton Kramer that particular girl wouldnt be dead if her killer was in his own  country and had not broken the law by coming here illegally.
no If a wall could have stopped a death, can you imagine if no guns could stop all these senseless shootings?
no Tell that to the victims families of yesterday's mass shooting, dick head!
yes There are more important things to do in this country than build a fucking wall because that QUACK(Trump) wants to see how much power he has over the pocketbook of America, he better worry about those chains that they are gonna put on his fat ass and his kids when Mueller puts out his report showing that the entire family of hardened Criminals were Traitors to our country, their is way too much to do in this country than build a wall because Putin is making him do it, time for that QUACK to go, specifically speaking to Prison for the rest of his worthless life!!!
no Stupid orange fk.
no Walls didn't work, why are they around every Hollywood stars and politicians homes?
yes 110% I support the safety of all american..and those who live here legal  no matter who you are and where you came from. I came here as an immigrant,,in late 80's from the Philippines. I went and have my physical exam, i waited to call my name, the day I was suppose to have my interview, we had a typhoon, but that did not stop me from going to have my interview,, the point is,, if you wan't something really bad, you can do it no matter what how hard, and do it the RIGHT way, Legal Way. Now I am American Citizen,, I had to start all over again,, study, pay, apply, waiting to be call my name, I work hard and Pay my tax every day when i go buy something in the store, I pay tax and yearly. If I can do it, anyone can. But Do it Legal.. Illegal is wrong, Period!
yes Build the wall! Trump 2020!!!
no To keep Americans that are inside the womb safe we must complete the PP wall.
no A Christian man killed many people. Lets deport the Cristians!
yes Jail2020
no Anna Sophia Wheland I am sure you have decided to believe that not banning guns -and not having sensible, enforced gun laws either- would save more lives, but facts have already proven your belief to be wrong.
yes GOD S NOT HUMAN. How does he become a child ? Who created Mary. you don't think !!!            KURAN  CHAPTER 112 ihlas verses In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.         1  Say, "He is Allah, the One.       2  Allah, the Absolute.         3  He begets not, nor was He begotten.          4  And there is none comparable to Him."
no We are here supporting you !
yes Thank God for Trump !!
no Will Trump share the opinion pieces by the victims of Parkland or any other mass shooting?
no Kenny Shuster except that the boots on the ground at the border said they need it..
yes Randy Mac Tina King well then they can do that for the other ppl lol
no Stephen Mattison Now there's a mindless assertion....  Nice dream you must be living in.  Enjoy the delusion as long as you can....
no As we protect our country from people entering illegally,could we also raise the danger level of Mexico?   Our son was murdered there on vacation 3 months  ago.  The murder statistics are outrageous.   Statistics are higher each year.  There were 30,000 murders there in 2017 and 17,000 in US.  Mexico is 1/3 the size of US.   We need to investigate murders of our citizens in Mexico!
no the Arizona desert is a great pastime target practice patience a night scope and a great time feed the coyotes and buzzards love Arizona
yes Quran chapter 103 asr Time verses         In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.      1  By Time.         2  The human being is in loss.              3  Except those who believe, and do good works, and encourage truth, and recommend patience.
yes Build a multiple layer barrier from the Pacific to the Gulf shut them down
no Thank you Trump!!!! MAGA!!!

yes Sorry for your loss..  for your family
yes Built the wall, keep the illegals out.
no Politicians dont mind,not their kids,,
no We must have a Wall now
yes Obama started building the wall, democrats passed bills to pay for it, a lot of illegals were stopped but the wall needs finished.  The democrats don't want the wall now since a republican is in office.  They want the illegals here to vote.  Same reason they don't want voter ID.
yes Agree with you Mr President
no How about doing it the legal way  ?
yes If Pelosiphy has wall, why not the country? So, build that wall. God bless POTUS
no Laura Anglin Peterson  I'm so sick of liberal stupidity.  Crime is a state issue.  This is a federal issue since it has to do with illegal immigration.   Stop voting Democrat, and your state will fair better.  Also, go back to school and educate yourself on state and federal issues.  You must have skipped government classes.  You can't use national security crises on guns, because it's a protected right in the Constitution.   Obama used national emergency for Obamacare, and the courts said its unconstitutional.   Quit feeding your mind with liberal poison.
no President Trump wishes to protect Americans!  Democrats don't care about Americans, only votes.
no What about all the legal Americans that are running around killing people?
yes YOU are so full of crap
yes Shut your whore mouth.
yes BUILD THE WALL. BUILD THE WALL.
no mendoza out of the country
yes Just wished that bone spurs would show some concern about shool kids and others who are killed by born citizens who have killed huge nos. In the last three years. But Orange man never says a word about them. He only points out an immigrant on matters of people killed.
yes Tom Barker The most successful president in 32 years. Pres. Trump has done more in 2 years than Obama, Bush, Clinton. The best part???? Destroying Obama's legacy...
no The FOREIGN DOGS have to go, NOW !
no From  U yes!
yes I think illegal immigrants are the scourge of all our countries , whatever it takes to stop them going into other countries,
no Sum of the PRAISING COMMENTS ARE SO HILARIOUS  !!!!!!!!!!!!
no De Bolden ots HORRIBLE u just dont like that it's part of the problems this country has.  We have laws and I do support others who want to be a citizen of this country but do it LEGALLY!!!!   And u talk about privilege, no one has it anymore!!!!  This country will become France and I do hope all Liberals/Democrats love the 3rd world country u have made it out to be!!!!
yes White people kill folks all the damn time.  Thats your crisis. Stricter gun laws
no BUILD IT HIGH!!
no These people live in Iowa or Kentucky and they have no idea what goes on at the border.
yes NOT ONLY DO WE NEED THAT WALL, WE ALSO NEED TO ROUND UP ALL ILLEGALS AND SHIP THEIR ASS'S BACK TO WHERE THEY CAME FROM
no Danny Jones hear hear!
yes Mention one mass shooting or school shooting by an immigrant?  The problem here is trump that is dividing USA with his hate on immigrants
no My thoughts and prayers go to all the families of those whos lives were taken by those here illegally. BUILD THAT WALL and keep America safe.
no Its been a crises for decades....and its about time we have a non-political hack with some balls to do what is right.
yes Sad losing child
no Tudy Anderson Latulip sad our president doesn't care about the Constitution.
yes Walls dont work have u heard of tunnels 20 feet under ground
no yes
no So very sad!
yes Maureen Hersey Brown .... Want to know why just look at the way trump's supporters berate and call Democrats and other political critics vile names (as trump does to his critics).  i have immigrants living in my neighborhood and they are way more decent than some of trump's that one sees in his posts.  Incidentally, I'm a proud Democrat and veteran who has served with others ... of both parties so you're slam is not only wrong it's not patriotism in any sense of the word.
no RED WRITTING LINES STILL SEE IT 30FOOT HIGH CLIMBED IT
yes Patsy,this is my reply to your earlier inquiry in part only, more very valid reasons exist also.
yes And most were registered Democrats let that sink in.
no Its good to know that banning immigrants will stop drunk driving.   I guess MADD spent money for decades for nothing.
yes This is why we need a wall. Here are some of the victims stories. Some of these people who are murdered were murdered by illegals who were previously deported. http://www.ojjpac.org/memorial.asp
yes James Ellis gun control
no So when white guys with guns walk into s school a shoot our kids by the dozens .. thats a not a problem but singular murders.... thats a national emergency?
yes Sorry for your loss.  There are many of us who stand behind Trump and the wall.  We must stop the illegal immigrant invasion.
yes I agree that illegal immigration is a problem.  Not enough for the wall though.  The bigger threat is all of the homegrown terrorists.  Shouldn't we focus on them first?
yes I'm disgusted with you r president. The bill you just signed guts ice and helps illegals  https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/02/15/trump-decries-catch-release-while-expanding-release-illegal-aliens/
no Im just here because Soros paid me to say no wall, crime dont stop with walls where do I get my $5 now
no God providence with brother Flag
yes All Lies
yes Grab it by the pussy
yes Fences make good neighbors
no Alberto Weisz exactly
yes Thanks President Trump
yes How many times have Progressives justified regulations on business and ignored the cost ...even if it only saved one life... Now the deny the most important function of the Federal Government, defense of the country, which is killing more people and doing more damage than all of the "safety measures"that they are forcing on us. Wake up! They want power & control  through centralized government by bureaucracy doing there will.
yes Yes sir! You are only doing your job for which the liberals are persecuting you! Never in my life in my 71 years in my country have I seen such hatred, corruption and deception. God bless you Pres. Trump! Now you need to get all the families that have suffered the loss of their loved ones and have a conference on TV with them. I mean all of them and there are a lot!
yes I would love to see a program like 60 minutes take a camera crew to the towns along the Mexican, US Border and hold town meetings to get the residents opinions about the wall, screw all these people who live far enough from the Border that their not really effected !
yes How is this even a debate for scumbags like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Senator Chuck Schumer and the rest of Democratic Klan?
yes Danny, the perp you cite is unfortunately one of us and we are left to deal with these kinds of things as a community through legal channels. The perp who took this mans daughter should never have been here and, given serious, intellectually honest and bipartisan action to secure our border bring sanity back to our immigration enforcement process, likely would not have removed her from our midst.   Sorry for your loss.
yes There are federal codes that allow him to protect the homeland.
no Amen! With you all the way! Answered the call on 9/11. Son answered it as well as a US Marine and still proudly served YOU and all of us!
no So true England is looking like Pakistan. Sad!
no God bless you and your family.My deepest condolances.
yes Fear mongering
yes people in united kingdom just  giving up on British government to do their jobs they care more about   approval ratings and deporting illegal immigrant isn't on the list.

yes We need the wall to be safe from outside, okay, but how can we be safe from inside with these stupid gun laws...
no I'm so sorry for your loss however more kids get killed in this country by American citizens. The immigrants aren't the problem, the guns are.

yes Finish the wall secure our Southern border
yes Here's a true story and a very sad one at that.  A few years ago in my city, a young mother was viciously gunned down by her own father who had snuck back into this country after already being deported.  He snuck in and killed his own daughter all because he felt disrespected because she was dating an older man.  So yeah, I'm all for the wall.
no zgn Sere Ergr yes.. ask the Chinese Korean Vietnamese an others that ares ..   What happens whit ISIS crossed from Canada borderline

yes Then deport all of the insurgents currently sitting in detention. Sweep the American Southwest house by house and remove them all.
yes Build the wall! Prayers for all!

yes Amnesty for all!
no I can barely walk because I was tboned by a illegal alien, fourth surgery is March 1...Build the wall!
yes It's very sad that you lost your child that's horrible. At one time your family were immigrants and needed to come to a better environment to have the necessities for life.
no don't sign that bill
no You should protect the American public against the American terrorists too.
yes So sorry for your loss.   This shoulda  already been handled.  Thank you President Trump for being in charge.
yes BUILD THE WALL TRUMP 2020
yes Dennis J Sitko theyre our citizens and they will be punished. We dont need criminals from other countries.
no Gabriel Anibal Toribio i saw 3 posts today of illegals killing anericans...i didnt bother tagging you..
no Luis Zepeda-Hernandez
no Mass shootings by domestic white male terrorists is the National Emergency in this country, but it's all crickets from  the Orange Turd and his ignorant gullible supporters.
no Im sick of this lunatic using families like its a parade... Sickening.
yes build the darn wall...
yes YES INDEED WE DO
yes Q1AWE ARE LOSING WAY TO MANY PEOPLE  BECAUSE ILLEGALS COMING INTO Ameria
no We have enough homelessness, drugs, crime, disease.  We need to solve these problems.  Build the wall!
no whats GROTESQUE is your opinion...but thats your right
yes Quit using fear tactics to scare your base. Pathetic wreck.
yes We must have the WALL
yes Gun control is more important, DOTARD
no One of my good friends was killed by a guy whose surname was Wall
yes It seems to be your only priority.  Hate wont bring them back. Guns in the hands of Americans kill more people than undocumented immigrants. That is our national emergency.
no Dylan Shaw so how many come in undetected?  No way to get accurate numbers.
yes https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/have-undocumented-killed-63000-us-9-11/      https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/03/us/immigrants-crime-numbers/index.html     [The majority of mass shooters have been far right politically and American citizen nationally from the beginning of the Trump administration] https://www.vox.com/a/mass-shootings-america-sandy-hook-gun-violence
no Keep up the great work Trump!
yes So many sheeps in this post
yes A+
no Keep us safe !!  Let the left howl, moan, and threaten. They are mad because you are getting your hands on their money their greedy hands won't get.
no Of  Course  we  do  !!!
yes You distort the risks as you exploit personal tragedy, all because your position 'Tests well'. History will judge you harshly.
yes The Great Wall of China, is a model to us with many lesson; including the story of the King of China who  had a kite maker killed and his kite burned, so that no one would ever fly over THE WALL !  ...there are more important problems in America and a Wall is not really going to help much !
no https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/media-releases/all
yes When I post on here !! I hope im giving you good advice. If you want to end this Socialist calling card. That the Democrats are using as a tactic.They want to attract people who are living paycheck to paycheck. You have a history of renting properties. Affordable housing is a major problem. It is swinging hard working Americans to the left. You could ruin this for Nancy and her crew. You could be the champion of the working poor. You need to start a program to subsidize rent based on income. You could fund it by putting a small tax on All rental properties and corperations, sales tax ect. I think this country would be behind you on this 100%. Id be glad to add one dollar to my monthly rent to pay for this. So would big corperations. Why ?? because it would help everyone to have a nice place to call home. It also could be used to provide housing for the chronic homeless people and vets. The Dems have painted you as this rich arrogant monster. This could be applied to home buyers also. You are a great leader. Show the American people how great a leader Donald J. Trump can be ~~ God Bless
no That's not the point ass clown. Can't stop it all but we can protect our border as a preventative measure. Get a clue puppet
no Right. But if a cop uses excessive force and kills an unarmed civilian, he's just "one bad apple" and not exemplary of all cops. Statistically, undocumented immigrants commit fewer crimes. For an obvious reason: they want to keep a low profile.
yes Only a coward will use those unfortunately events for a political game, a coward and a traitor!!
no Youre a Moran president Trump!!! YOU are the National emergency! Impeach Trump now! Stupid narcissist
yes 100 victims die from gun violence every day in America. THAT'S an emergency.
yes FINISH THE WALL
yes we'll save you some crumbs
yes Trump is doing what no president would of done!
no I'm so sorry for your loss Mr Ferguson I cannot  imagine  losing my daughter. But  I Iost my cousin on September 11th at the world trade center by terrorists. It's just not Mexicans that are coming here illegally it's other illegals  aswell from other countries. We need the wall built it's a loophole for anyone that wants to come to our country we need all the Mexicans and illegal immigrants to go back to their own country and  if they want to come here they have to do it legally bottom line
yes Yes everyone knows that..has nothing to do with disliking immigrants..it's the ILLEGAL one's..do the proper process and there is no issue at all
no Best President in my life time. Trump, 2020.
yes Matt Burdeno
yes My heart is broken for you. It is past time to have this issue addressed and the criminals handled and our American laws enforced!
no BUILD THE WALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yes hi
no Fact: Those in the Trump administration commit crimes at a higher rate than illegal immigrants.
yes BLOOD BART LINES NO NO
no ll that money Obama sent to Iran could have payed for the wall . And the money was already aproved years ago and where did it go.
yes Why doesnt he ever post articles about all of the victims of gun violence by white men?
yes What kills me is most of these morons live in a gated apartment or neighborhoods that say walls don't work
no An illegal killed my nephew, a young dedicated police officer. Shot him during a traffic stop! Walls that are dug in deep and built very high will save lives, no question!
no Many more lives have been killed by American white males in mass shootings than by illegal immigrants. If you would have declared a national emergency on the gun violence we would stand with you because that is a true national emergency.
no Electrify the wall
no How sick Pepe are to try to make excuses for a wall
yes Diana Klausner theyre standing up to the good old boys club and established oligarchy, they hate when the status quo is upset!
yes Some of the points on here are good ones. But the big point that some don't want to see. If we was not spending billions and billions a year on illegals. That would be money that could be used to help people with medical issues. Help vets. Help the homeless. We are spending billions a year on people who have not brought so much as a soda pop In this country. As for the water in Michigan. It was a problem long before trump was elected. If the voters in Michigan would quit voting the same people in that got them in this mess. Just maybe things would get fixed. Your water problems are controlled by your local government not the president.
yes De Bolden where was the shooting?
yes Trump hires undocumented workers? Just five of the 565 companies in President Trumps business empire are signed up to use E-Verify, the governments best tool to weed illegal immigrants out of the workforce, according to a Washington Times analysis that suggests the president could personally be doing more on that front. Mr. Trumps golf courses in Charlotte, Los Angeles and Miami, his hotel in Washington, D.C., and a hotel he operated in New York are signed up. But his marquee Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida is not signed up, nor are his golf courses in Virginia, Philadelphia or Bedminster, New Jersey  where, The New York Times reported Thursday, some illegal immigrants have been working for years. One of them, Victorina Morales, a Guatemalan woman who jumped the border in 1999, has been at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster for more than five years, making Mr. Trumps bed, cleaning his toilet and dusting his golf trophies, the newspaper reported.

yes Affffff he still playing this game and the trump-zombies are oh yeahhh... Jesus, year by year guns are killing innocent pple and Americans (not only in North America but in the whole north, centre and south... all sent from U.S.A.) more pple are dying from guns from America than casual accidents where unfortunately people had their faith to cross with, which involves anyone that comes from other countries trying a better life in U.S. - but yeah lets talk about people from other countries coming over U.S. because that sounds legit instead of the real problems you guys are facing ... are you guys drinking the kool-aid or what ?! (Everyone remembers how the kool-aid pple died right??!) stop being fool ! He is the only one killing Americans and everyone elses while making profits on the top of it! ... and Trump-zombies are applauding believing every kind of nonsense - what a clueless nation!
no How many kids are killed from school shootings? How many people die from poverty and not being able to afford their medicine? Didn't 16000 veterans kill themselves this year?? But yes the Mexicans are our country's main concern. Idiots.

yes sorry about your daughter and i agree the wall must be built

no Eva Graham bella fucking Pelosi
yes 45 is a sick psycho who is a malignant narcissist,  mysogynist,  child raper!!!
yes The true enemy of the people is the state.  We'll never defeat our oppressors divided.  Police are the protectors of the elite rich top 1 percent.  Bankers bought their power over the us government when they established the federal reserve.  We're tricked into hating each other for skin color,religion differences,  and political views.   Statism is slavery  Taxation is theft  We're all servants to the state.  The government is our God.  Try to opt out of paying taxes,or a traffic ticket.  Everything is enforced by state violence via cops.
no I WANNA SEE ALL YOUR GRERN CARDS NOW
yes Bull$hit! Trump doesnt care about anything but his own sorry, fat a$$! Nothing worth believing coming from this moron!
no Yes and yes
yes Tudy you beat me to it. You're exactly right. We have enough criminals, we don't need any more.
no Secure the border stop the madness. "Finish the wall." it is a crisis and definitely ," National Emergency." God bless the only man in D.C. who cares, My President Donald J. Trump, voted for you and nothing will stop us from voting for you again, We humbly give you our vote , as it is all we can give. God speed good man.

yes The 80s called and they want your hairdo back..
yes But we also need protection from our govt.
yes Mr. President,
yes Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher.
yes How many have been killed by white right wing terrorists?
yes It is our constitutional right to be safe even against our own government. Build, build, build. Thank you for all you are doing President Trump! Trump for 2020
yes BITCH let's not forget what your own Government did to Paradise
no Tony Connelly how many die from drug OD from drugs smuggled across the southern border?

yes Ill bet that Nobel Prize will look great on the mantle under the stuffed elephant head, next to the economy bucket from KFC.
yes This is HORRIBLE that our President would share something like this. Smh from a drunk driving accident? Come on now...this is SO DIRTY! That white kid in TX that killed a whole family didnt even get any jail time because of his privilege. But u wanna use this as a platform for billions of dollars for a wall??? GTFOH!
yes An illegal alien driving a loaded simi ass-ended a line of cars stopped at a road repair who were waiting on the pilot car to get through. The older couple in the last car in line was smashed into a pickup. The pickup smashed into the back of a loaded cattle trailer and was deflected into the ditch. The older couples car was then smashed flat between the oncoming simi and the stopped simi and were killed instantly. The truck driver was an illegal and was burned in the crash. He was taken into custody and transported to OKC for treatment. There was never any news of what was done with him but I imagine he was released and hauled ass for Mexico leaving Americans with the medical bills and funeral expenses.
yes Daniel Antonio Thomas  well how does that stand for crime committed by Your own people? Pearl Brown Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans. (Legal immigrants were 87 percent less likely.)  Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And over 40% of illegals come by AIR
yes Do you think that a fucking wall can protect you. I think that it is not a solution
no Let's not hate people who don't look like us!
no Wall now
no I can't help but wonder what the  parents, siblings, friends, or even the victims themselves,  that were killed or knew someone killed by an illegal, feelings were on illegals and Sanctuary cities prior to these tragic events.
yes Stand firm President TRUMP We are with you - God speed  #Trump2020  #BuildTheWall

no heartbreaking
yes What about the underground tunnels?
no So sad.
yes Los  Angeles Times  03/04/2008  ""Stanford University called about Jamiel Shaw a week or so ago, intrigued by the slight but speedy running back for Los Angeles High School, the Southern League's most valuable player last year. Rutgers University called a few days later. The Shaw family already had reason to be proud. Jamiel's mother, Army Sgt. Anita Shaw, was on her second tour of duty in Iraq. On Sunday night, it was Jamiel's father on the phone and then his son's girlfriend, Chrystale Miles. Jamiel Sr. called to tell him to hurry home from the mall. The 17-year-old boy was three doors away when someone (Pedro Espinoza ) shot him to death while he was still talking on his cellphone to Chrystale,  Jamiel Sr. heard the shots almost as soon as he hung up. He ran out of the house, raced around the corner and found his son lying on the sidewalk, bleeding."  "Los Angeles police officials described the killing as random and senseless, cutting down a youth who had been doing everything right in his life -- from hitting the books to never missing church to inspiring the Los Angeles High Romans to last year's Southern League title. A police spokeswoman said two Latino men pulled up in a car, jumped out, asked Jamiel if he belonged to a gang, and shot him when he didn't answer. She said Jamiel was not affiliated with a gang". "The youth's football coach, Hardy Williams, was with the family Monday at their 5th Avenue home, where Jamiel's trophies and medals lined the mantel. His 9-year-old brother, Thomas, wore Jamiel's favorite Atlanta Braves cap. Tears flowed. "He was a very special kid," Williams said. "Not only was he an outstanding athlete, he was a good person. I've never seen Jamiel mad. He had such a big smile." The coach described his standout player as "a Houdini on the football field," and the numbers backed it up. As a junior, Jamiel rushed for more than 1,000 yards last year, averaging just over 14 yards per carry. An invitational All-City first-team selection, he scored 11 touchdowns, returned punts and kickoffs, and played defensive back. He also competed in track. Hours before he was shot, Jamiel had spent the day at a football camp at Pasadena City College, Williams said. "Stanford just called me about his transcripts," he said. "Rutgers called a couple of days ago. He was just on track. . . . He was very elated." He is not elated anymore. He is dead. Rotting under six feet of dirt, Donald Trump is his only voice. He speaks for the Dead.
no Build the Wall! Enought is enought.
yes Bahahaha!! Yeah, that's why the dumbass Chicago mayor wants it to be a sanctuary city!

yes BUILD THAT WALL !!!!
no An American killed 5 people yesterday. Wheres your outrage?
yes Danny Jones  Quote Great British culture. I'm a Brit. The EU hate us. End of. So I'd rather we gave the USA 5 billion as a gift for the wall rather than give 39 billion a year to the EU ...  You havent really answered any questions - just added more illiterate drivel.  What is your view of the great British culture and how has EU membership eroded it?  Do answer with specifics if you can. Why do you think the EU hate us? They certainly dont want us to leave but theyre not going to compromise their membership tenets to suit the U.K. - we already have a good deal. How would gifting 5billion to the US benefit the U.K. as much as membership to the EU has?  I doubt youll be able or willing to answer any of the above - just like Trump supporters, youre not that bright and completely misinformed.  Twats like you shouldnt have the vote.
no The wall yes
no Kenzie Kawamura  Democrats do not want to send them back.  There will be several steps in this progress.
no It was the largest cocaine bust in 25 years at California's Port Hueneme.  More than 200 pounds of cocaine were found hidden on two ships.  The feds announced the bust on the same day Donald Trump said drugs don't come through ports of entry.
no Build Wall!!!!!!

yes Comrade stooge motherfucka individual 1 made the greatest declaration of a national emergency in American history the emergency at the southern border is way more serious than the 911 attacks and if anyone says otherwise just ask the angel dads and moms #TFA #GoBackToRussiaTraitor #HateHasNoHomeHere
yes So sad!!  We must work to stop this!!  The wall will help!!!
yes What's even more amazing is that White mass shooters kill more innocent people, yet Trump won't ever talk about em why?? If Trump does all of a sudden it's a "mental illness" is it a mental illness if an illegal does it??
no Ahmad Mahmoud it is not a beauty pageant.  Trump is doing what he was elected to do.
no Ib
yes "Someone was killed by a gun,  so we should ban guns" That's how dumb this is

yes why build a wall that can be tunneled under . makes no sense to me...
yes God bless you, President Trump, for ALL you do for us. I pray for you and your family and those working to help you save our wonderful, free country every day. You are doing a phenomenal job under idiotically difficult circumstances!!!   
yes Many, one could say it's the addicts fault but I wouldn't. The facts are 90% of herion come across the southern border.
yes Need To Impeach
yes Bbuild now
no We are so sorry for your loss and totally agree with you and President Trump that there IS A CRISIS at the border and the wall in the right places can help keep all Americans and their children safer!
no Any chance you can come over here Donald and build a wall right around our little London bubble?

no Sad and sorry for their lost...pero no te agas pendejo Trump, what about all the undocumented human beings here in the U.S. that also have saved American lives..you know the storys are out there...
no Wendi DelValle sounds like guns in the wrong hands is the issue, not walls.   5 Americans shot and killed at their job, by another American.
no An illegal killed my cousin husband .
yes Stricter gun laws will protect Americans walls will not help the crime problem
yes Get rid of the white male gun toting Christians and well all be much safer.
yes One death of any American by an illegal is 100% one too many. It should be ZERO! These Americans should be alive today. Once again Democrats have blood on their hands. If they arent murdering full term babies they are leaving us wide open for the taking! Build the Wall! Stop these Democrats and their Anti American Agenda!
no https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/votes-put-emergency-termination-trumps-desk-sen-tammy/story?id=61122331&cid=social_fb_abcn&fbclid=IwAR0-VC36RbC2d42UWj8-aVKWVAFXto4n83xVsVNx7s6YIHcq7zy-IUF4wng . ..

no Build that Wall Mr President
yes BUILD THE WALL AND MORE LAW AND ORDER,
no WALL!
no The wall is a way to nip it in the bud. If stopped at the border, the pos liberal democrat so called leaders of ours can't have a chance to give them our tax dollars. No illegal deserves the first free thing from the American government. That's just the most obvious reason. There are several.
yes Pam Tigert Me too
no Bull O'Neill The Military Doesnt Seem to Appreciate Trumps Border Stunt                                                                       President Trumps decision to deploy thousands of active-duty soldiers to the border with Mexico, ostensibly to defend against an invasion of asylum seekers from Central America, is such a transparent political stunt that even his fellow Republicans are dismayed  if only because they think its a less effective midterms strategy than focusing on the midterms. As it turns out, another group you might generally expect to support the president is also less than thrilled with his order: namely, the military itself.  Responding to criticism of the dubious deployment last week, Defense Secretary James Mattis demurred: We dont do stunts in this department. The soldiers being sent to the border are there to provide support to the Department of Homeland Security, just as they often do after natural disasters, Mattis insisted. The secretary did not speak to the question of whether a dwindling caravan of around 3,000 Central American asylum seekers, currently 800 miles from the border and traveling on foot, really merited the same emergency response as a hurricane.  Since then, several reports have come out showing that Trumps original vision for the deployment, tendentiously titled Operation Faithful Patriot, was larger in scope than what the Pentagon ultimately allowed, as some of what the president expected the soldiers to do was at best wasteful and at worst illegal. The administrations first request, CNN reported on Friday, was for soldiers to provide crowd and traffic control and protect Customs and Border Protection personnel, which some Defense officials viewed as law enforcement activities the military is barred by law from performing. That request was rejected, as was a proposal that soldiers construct housing for detained migrants, according to Reuters.
yes Sorry for your loss, but Trump is not the answer.
no GREATEST PRESIDENT EVER!  THE ALMIGHTY GOD IS WITH YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP AMEN! ! ! !
yes Waste of a life... how many more die while Dems debate... blood on their hands

no I was in your corner for a LONG time, President Trump. But, I'm starting to feel like you are just jerking us around. Best get it in gear and start getting that wall together QUICKLY.
no Curtis Rice OMG! Your attempt at humor has literally BLOWN MY MIND

yes Cheating betraying manipulating Gaslighting assholes
yes So if he had traveled here legally, drank a bunch of beers, ran two red lights, and hit his daughter...she would still be alive? Do beers make you more drunk if your an illegal immigrant?  Trying to find the correlation to his status as an illegal immigrant and her dying due to blunt force trauma from being hit by a car.  Do we know that this guy didnt come legally and just stay longer than his visa allowed and that is how he became an illegal immigrant? How would a wall have stopped that?
no Thank you for having the courage to safeguard our USA from the invasion of all these countries and how think they can just illegally cross our border.

yes We are withYou, Mr President Donald J. Trump, All ways and Always...
yes However the crime rate is lower by illegal immigrants than by legal citizens.
yes What about husbands who beat their wives? Should they be in the White Houseyou filthy piece of trash.
yes You can not blame EVERY illegal immigrant for your loss...NO WALL
no Lol, go away you fucking idiot and take your red neck inbred supporters with you
no The President is a member of ms13
yes Build the fricken wall
no It is time to wake up California and America and Stop voting for The lying hypocrite communist socialist liberals democrats that are destroying this country. We must put America First. WE MUST BUILD THE WALL
yes Agreed
yes And  somehow,,,the sleazy selfish Democrats like Waters...with her big mouth..seem to not give a damn about these poor people.
yes U covered up the rape of a 4 year old girl by officer Jose Nunez. U covered up the rape of a 4 year old girl. U protected a child molester. All u care about is money. U say and do anything as long as it fits your agenda.  #TrumpIsABitch
no For  your vanity wall: Sending thoughts and prayers.                            A white American male shot and killed five people and injured many law enforcement yesterday in Pence's Indiana. WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT THAT??
yes Funny how all the mass shootings are done by white people ,but you think the danger comes from across the border idiots.
yes This is deeply troubled, but if you only blame immigrants for killing people, you should put even more priority on banning the huge mountain of weapons in your country.  Is it an idea that the arms manufacturers and their factories are being converted into rescue companies that are ready to help people around the world instead of supplying weapons so that they break each other apart. There must be better business models than earning money by causing death. One must be the first, America can make a big revolution so that people get air and can build a life.  With a better life, the need to emigrate also lapses. A win-win situation ..
yes So what's the problem completing the border wall? Most if not all of us have some walls around our homes. If they are not complete then anyone can get into our backyard and break in right? It's really common sense folks. It's not we are wasting 5.75 Billion but just enough to finish building the border walls.
no Patty Bertocchini La Puma you people just dont get it we dont want the illegal immigrants here period.  I dont care if they kill people or dont if they ride around on your democratic unicorns and spread love lol they dont belong here BUILD A GIANT WALL ha ha not sure why the Democrats are so against securing our boarders oh I know because then they'd have nobody to vote democratic ha ha not sure how you people are going to handle 6 more years of TRUMP
no President Trump, I want to travel to America
no https://www.facebook.com/groups/598619343899059/1,543 Members
yes Sorry for you loss. Illegals should be deported immediately.
no President Trump may I suggest you coming to the national farm machinery tractor pull next year
yes oh! is this the best movie of 2020
no #TeamBuildTheWall
no Why do demos  give no credence to our America children. It just astonishing that they dont give a damn about us & only want to Let in illegals. It must be all about votes. Vets homeless on streets that just ignore us & making Americans second on list. Vote red and remember what they are doing. Cant get away with anything unless we vote them out.
yes ONE more of American life lost is already enough... UNACCEPTABLE Stop the genocide of our people.
yes EL chapo schould pay for the wall..
yes You'll get it done. I'm pulling for you, and I'm also going to vote for you in 2020. Keep up the great work, and God bless you and your family, Mr. President!
yes You need to put some ointment on that burnt ego
yes it'd be easier to just get rid of you
no The democrats dont care
no Exploiting a person's death for political gain- is there anything lower? What an incredible scumbag Trump is.
yes Trump's main point of being elected and if elected by the people of United States of America was to build a wall he got elected, hes gonna build the wall! That's what the people who voted him in want!!  It is in no way what's in "HIS" best interests, it's what's in the best interests of the "people" who voted him in! Also - allowing ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION is not in in the constitution, trust me I checked twice. So he's not subverting the constitution in any way.... just saying
no God bless President Trump. We the people love you and will vote for you again in 2020 !!! MAGA TRUMP 2020
no the congress woman(although she wants to be called the democrat socialist) needs to go!
no They murdered my beautiful granddaughter s father
yes Man...... let it go dude
yes Taylor Embree, killed by a three time deported illegal DUI convict; Bakersfield, CA.   This bullshit has to stop.  The American people have had enough.
yes Build a better judicial system. 40 yrs for selling pot? A slap on the fanny and some cool zip tie cuffs for jumping the border? Sarry....biff law
yes Sad day. Borders open. Amnesty. Dems destroy GOP.  NEW SURGE WILL COME. You need to step up your game... https://www.facebook.com/DMLNewsApp/videos/344302992850242/
yes James Ellis thank you Mr no profile
yes Oh, well if that happened once then Im convinced.  Its s national emergency. 
yes Jess Castrejn yeah its honestly sad that hes allowing his daughters death to be used in propaganda like this.
yes Sharon Fantana what prevents me from walking into your house?
no THE BORDER WALL DOESN'T KEEP OUT CRIMINALS. Do you HONESTLY THINK the criminal stands in line, patiently waiting - for DAYS - to get through a legal entry point? Even YOU cannot be THAT STUPID.
yes Walls with remote machine gun turrets work better!
no How about gifting that 5bn to the NHS, you Brexiter muppet coward?
yes White supremacist and other far-right extremist groups have killed 51 police officers since 1990, according to a report published by the Anti-Defamation League last week. Left-wing extremist groups, including black nationalists, killed 11 during the same period.  In 2017 alone, black nationalists and other leftists killed no police, while white supremacists and anti-government extremists fatally attacked a police officer and two corrections officers, the report said.  But while the FBI tracks so-called black identity extremists as domestic terror threats  as an FBI counterterrorism report completed in August and leaked in October revealed it doesnt have an equivalent designation for white extremists.  Experts worry that the broad labeling of black groups, and not white ones, is an indication that federal law enforcements targeting of certain groups is based less on evidence than on politics.  https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article196423174.html
yes mass shootings by white me is the real emergency but nothing is done to stop it.
no My fear is not the defeat of stupidity on the left, the American people see thru the lies.  My biggest fear is weakness from the right, its so hard to defend the party that wont even try.  Trump 2020 without fail
yes Laura Calderwood hated the sound of her daughter's name  Mollie Tibbetts  coming from Pres. Trump's mouth as he sought to use her death to drum up anti-immigrant sentiment.  Laura is living her rebuttal: She has taken in a teen named Ulises, the son of 2 immigrants who were forced to flee the community when an anti-immigrant backlash drove out many who worked at the same farm as Mollies alleged killer.
yes A wall will not stop drugs and illegals, but it is a place to start.  When you want to fix a problem, start with the first step.  Build a wall.
yes or just walk across because of the lack of other security measures...build the wall
yes Don't forget the millions of displaced American workers due to the foreigner invasion.
no Tell Congress Trump is coming and Americans are coming with him...MAGA...FINISH THE WALL...
yes When it finally happens to the DEMS families, then they will realize how ignorant they are for not wanting the borders safe.
no So do guns
yes  Were gonna build a wall!    And military families in need of housing, disaster victims and people suffering from the opioid epidemic are gonna pay for it! 
no Don Rosenbaum
yes Just like 144 police officers killed last year 1 by a undocumented immigrant
no Let's get it built <3
yes We have 30 million illegals here now, when will it be to much?   Stupidity is watching the problem grow and ignoring it.
yes Diane Edwards Linton so the gun walks up to people and shoot themselves?
yes Did you hear about Aurora illinois shooting yesterday asshole? Guess what, he was legal and with a felony and somehow he bought a gun.  How your stupid wall is going to solve that ?
no What about all the legals here who commit mass killings? Should we build a wall to keep them in?
no Deborah Bartlett no it wasn't. The initial package included a 19th century wall with no technology being used. Geez, don't you people ever pay attention?
no Dave David Let's get rid of every brain dead liberal, starting with you!
yes Progressive loons could careless. All they want are votes. Btw this a manufactured crisis. Only its by the globalist and supporters of the. NWO.
yes An illegal alien bastard murdered my godson.  May all MS-13 animals rot in hell.  I stand with the President.  BUILD THE WALL...and crime will fall.
no The democrats and whosoever wanna have humanity and pity for these illegal immigrants please post your Name, address and phone number so that illegal immigrants can come to you! Because of that, you can practice what you call humanity and pity on them!
yes This wall is not necessary! Trump said that it is not an emergency!!!! He just needs to satisfy his nit wit base or he is TOAST!
yes Cindy Sak Nowak obviously your comprehensive skills are based on Fictional world's where the same cops that you idiots are calling oppressors and murderers all of a sudden become your protectors when law abiding citizens have no guns. Get a clue
yes In Germany dies people about illegal immigrants too.
yes Protecting Americans when u r threatening to release 800 isis fighters? So our children (not yours of course) fought and died for what? And those left To live and fight these guys again?  ISIS-controlled territory is shrinking in Syria, and President Trump is declaring a military victory over the terrorist group. But there is another front growing in West Africa.
no More Americans are killed by Americans than come over the boarder
yes Emily Neal new laws will not stop a criminal from getting a gun.
no bunkum.
yes THAT WONT STOP PEOPLE FROM GETTING KILLED - JUST 5 PEOPLE GOT KILLED YESTERDAY - DON'T SEE YOU GOING ON ABOUT THAT.
yes An illegal immigrant cut my lawn we dont need a wall
yes Chenier--This is just one case out of thousands every year. The liberal democrat media refuses to report on them, because it doesn't help their agenda for open border's. The point is, that these illegal's weren't suppose to be here & each case would have been one "less case" of a family losing a loved one to murder, or a killing by a drunk driving illegal.
no https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Las_Vegas_shooting
no https://www.facebook.com/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneWild/photos/a.506655886092108/2136549723102708/?type=3&theater&ifg=1
yes Look it up the judge said that because he came from a privaledged family he would not have to go to jail....for killing an ENTIRE family in a drunk driving incident. Im not gonna do ur research for u.

no Simon Kitson Melania is legal citizen lol
yes Walls work 100%
yes round up all the illegal Aliens and detain the ones who allowed them to enter and stay.
no How.many children have been murdered by American citizens? 1200 last year killed by guns. That is a real crisis.
yes THE RIGGED AND CORRUPT PRESIDENT IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE
no So sad .
yes My 18 year brother was killed by an illegal immigrant in 2005 who was high on drugs and drunk,  he is still in prison to this day in United States.  2020 he will be released back to Mexico. I support the wall 100%  No wall will bring my brother back but maybe save someone else's brother or sister 
yes The MSM doesn't report the news any more but years ago the Mexican president released all his criminals from prisons so long as they left the country and went to America.  That explains illegal aliens of Mexico and crime.
yes Well a white guy killed my relatives.
no I know!
no Yes it will
yes Spreading fears. Wow, how stupid you all are. We do have Americans who kill other Americans too! Quacking, quacking, and quacking.
yes An illegal immigrant killed my friends 16  year old daughter Madison Wells from New Jersey this summer. She was stabbed several times outside in front of her aunt's house she went into the house collapsed on the floor bleeding out her father walked in shortly after her called 911 and she passed away as they were Wheeling her through the emergency room doors
yes White American men kill the most Americans every year. True fact. What keeps me safe from them?
yes https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/02/15/fact-checking-trumps-announcement-national-emergency/?utm_term=.854e3868061d
yes Do not talk. Do it!
no Isaiah Patch fake
no The statistic shows the number of mass shootings in the United States between 1982 and November 19, 2018, by race and ethnicity of the shooter(s). Between 1982 and November 2018, 60 out of 107 mass shootings were initiated by White shooters. The Las Vegas strip massacre in 2017 had the highest number of victims between 1982 and 2018, with 58 people killed, and over 500 injured. Additional information on mass shooter profiles in the United States

yes #MAGA #BuildTheWall
yes Fully agree.
yes There are certain barriers that separate and protect, for the benefit of all. There are physical barriers, there are moral barriers, and there are social barriers. Liberals inherently desire to remove ALL  barriers, in their insane rush to destroy everything (Look to Sacramento, Detroit, any bastion of Liberal 'utopia' for confirmation). Barriers WORK, they keep the illegal separated from the legal, the insane separated from the sane, and the corrupt and criminal from the innocent and righteous. Society NEEDS barriers, it doesn't need Liberals.
no A white legal American killed my family member.. let's stop that 1st.
no Yes, let us build the wall! Let Herbert Hoover get his way over another Great Depression on the horizon! Let there be more government shutdowns! LADIES AND GENTLEMAN! OUR PRESIDENT IS OUR PRESIDENT, HES A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS MAN LOOKING TO MAKE A PROFIT OUT OF THE UNITED STATES.
no And ???A Resident guy kill 5 People in United State! What is the difference??? all we are human beings!!
no What about all the school shooters? What do we do about those, oh they were white btw.
yes Dan, Ryan loves the comment section here
no Why do we assume that every illegal immigrant climbed over the wall. I saw their make shift boats washed ashore in Florida one year? Pretty sure they weren't American and are now walking the streets of Florida! As a matter of fact all the hired help at Mar A Lago are illegal! Oh, wait, he fired them because he just recently(  ahem) found out that they were illegal!!!!! He is so full of it!
yes Thank you for all you do.  You are a REAL PRESIDENT.  KEEP Building the Wall.
yes stop the foreign aid that we have no clue as to who it is actually going to...
no Trump is right the left is wrong
no Brian Sterling a ridiculous number of Catholic priests have raped children.  We should rid the US of all Catholics.
yes I am sorry sorry for your loss.  We are fighting as hard as we can to stop all of these illegals coming in and taking over our country and killing us right and left. God bless Trump.
yes Sam North why are people not seeing through the idiot?
no https://ktla.com/2019/02/16/5-dead-5-wounded-in-cancun-after-gunmen-burst-into-bar-and-open-fire/
no A white American killed my best friend for his wallet. Happens repeatedly every day
yes Margo Smith wow, really? You have fake profile.  Why hiding.  If you say something stand by your words.
no Gun violence by American right wing extremists is also very problematic. When is this going to be a priority?
no I would be on the border with an AR and lots of ammo...when as Americans are we going to stop this crap...
no Great. Waste beelions on a wall that the illegal immigrant probably flew over.
no The democrats and republicans voting against the wall should all be charged with murder for each person killed by an illegal.  They are responsible for the deaths.
yes Some people are just too freaking stupid to get it. Build build build!
yes That dude would kill anyone with a headbutt
yes Steel Slats
no I'm with Trump
yes Walls don't work......they just start digging using fake documents or boats wall is waste of money simple maths says war on drugs has never been won probably never will
no Thank you Mr President! Its too late for my husband who was killed by illegals and left to die on the road. Our family has been forever broken since. All in an effort so they can have a better life! What about ours? His? At what expense is it ok? Its not!!
yes Pres Trump-  The Democrats left you with no choice but to declare a national emergency.  Your supporters stand behind your decision.  -a former Democrat TRUMP 2020
yes Andy Serritella the man's an IDIOT !
no And what chuck and Nancy and the rest of the democrats dont want to hear this ? Build that wall we are with you president trump
yes There is no such thing as an illegal immigrant!! They are either an immigrant  !!! Or illegal Allen!!!! An immigrant is someone that has papers work Visa or the American government is aware they are here.  An illegal is someone that jumped the border and is hiding breaking the law.
no I believe legislation would be way more effective than a wall.  If there were no benefits, no work, no way to even move around the country and commit crimes, and there was immediate punishment (whipping) and deportation, then we wouldn't have a problem with illegals wanting to be here in the first place.
yes A bunch of white American males are responsible for the mass shootings in this country.
no Stephanie Rosenow it's over 29 billion
yes People who speak against the  wall have never had  a child dying in their arms from a herion over dose
yes Meanwhile, yesterday, four Americans were shot to death  by another native-born American. And one year earlier, 17 Americans were shot to death by another native-born American. And we have a mass shooting pretty much every week in this country, committed by native-born Americans. The real emergency is gun violence.  Get your head out of your fucking ass Trump
yes Blame a whole nation for one shitty situation.. yeah seems fair.. dumbass
yes The illegal alien was drunk and driving a stolen truck running people off the road. My uncle was coming home from the grocery store. This should never of happened.
no The Lord Jesus Christ rebuke the DemocRats expose they ARE THE DRUG RUNNERS OBSTRUCTING OUR PRESIDENT FROM PROTECTING THE UNITED STATES amen
no Yes, make  wall  in the  border  with Mexico   our  country    will have   safty from  elegal  enemy
yes What is justified doesnt need to be justified....
yes Wealthy people have walls around their mansions ~ of course walls work. There would be no angel moms if we had a border wall because illegals could not get in the USA to kill Americans. #BuildTheWallNow!
yes And people complained when the democRATs used the deaths of children to further their agenda...
yes Christopher Goodwin I agree...we need more gun laws
yes LIAR!  LIAR!  Over 20,000 Americans are murdered by fellow Americans EVERY year!  Build a wall around that you fat MORON! 
yes I just reread your post ,dont really know what you are getting at.so if I offered you sorry.
no For every single American an illegal kills, we need to kill 10,000 of illegals.
yes You can't drive vehicles through tunnels. Also tunnels cost the cartels a ton of time, money, and resources. Most importantly it slows them down.
yes Keep up the good work
no I haven't felt safe for decades!!...feeling safer, but I live in California and am waiting for Our big beautiful wall and swamp drainage!!

no BUILD THE WALL NOW, NOT NEXT WEEK OR NEXT YEAR. WE NEED THE WALL BEFORE ITS TOO LATE.  GOD BLESS AMERICA 
no THE TRUE COST: See the Tragic List of Americans Killed by Illegal Aliens at a New Online Memorial.

no We need that wall built.  Th dmocrates are deaf.  Guess they need hearing ai ds.
yes Sad anyone is cut down young. People die every day. No wall ever - boots on the ground, drones in the air and tech to catch what eyes miss. Anything else is wasted tax dollars. Pesos wheres the  pesos ?
no Chuck Brantley
yes Democrats support 2 things: Obama and illegal immigrants who kill Americans. Its who they are.
no Okay why don't you do the same post for white kids killing each other due to your stupid gun laws. Oh because the NRA paid you and you don't want to admit the real threat is guns in the US. Actually look at statistics of crime who commits the crimes sorry but it ain't immigrants or illegals because you don't understand the situations that people come from or why they are illegal. For them its sorry you can't enter this country because the USA decided to destroy your country causing all government bodies and data they held about you to  be destroyed as well a lot of the people that would provide the proper paper work are dead or have fled. So after you risk your life escaping a war torn hell none of you will understand or have any sympathy because we fear everything especially if its different . sorry conservatives but apparently you are more fearful than less conservative minds. Don't worry there's not a illegal hiding in ya cupboard Obama put there. Don't forget Jesus was a refugee
no How many Americans kill people every day? What are you doing about them?
yes Keep the illegal immigrants out!!
yes Alyssa Klimek one of the problems.
yes We have a big rat infestation in the "halls of Congress", Globo. Rat. Defined as rodents who are for open borders, Global governance of all nations by one central command and leadership, George Bush, called it The New World Order, and both Demarats, and Rhino crats as well as non party players are against our President!
yes My God this makes me sick!
no Want proof..haters...read the article in the USA today ..jackass!!
yes I support Trump because I support justice
yes Diane Edwards Linton guns don't kill people, moron people kill people. There are more traffic fatality then gun incidents. So why not ban driving? Yeah see my point moron????
yes An illegal immigrant killed my father in 1991.
yes First safety
yes 45,000 people die from lack of healthcare every year. That number far surpasses deaths by illegal immigrants. Your wall wont help that
yes Marjorie Anderson  please don't discredit a 4 year old in such a way. We have a 4 year old... She knows that walls work. She builds them around her toys while playing to protect the people inside  (ps: this is totally making a farce of what was said above, I disagree with the original poster, obviously)
no If President Trump only knew of this... murder... just down the road from the Winter White House...  Hoping to impress upon Governor Ron DeSantis that the FDLE and FBI should "get on this". Murderers walking free because of incompetent Officers and wealthy backers.   Executive Summary:  Palm Beach County family seeks redress, fair justice, and relief after being denied U.S. and State of Florida Constitutional rights under color of law related to and concerning the homicide of NIA LEE ANKNER.  Specifically, in the face of overwhelming relevant, material, and competent evidence, to date all State and Local Authorities have refused to initiate a criminal investigation into and regarding the opiate caused death of NIA LEE ANKNER. Although the surviving family has provided competent and substantial evidence of a homicide; there has been no related criminal investigation initiated nor conducted by any authorized Florida law enforcement entity, being wholly contrary to and violative of Art. I,  2, and Art. I,  16(b) Fla. Const. (1998), and  839.13,  839.20,  843.0855, and  843.14, Fla. Stat.  Due to incompetence of Town of Palm Beach investigating Law Enforcement Officers at the crime scene, and the subsequent and continuing obstruction of justice by supervising Town of Palm Beach Officers; the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, (FDLE), Palm Beach Sheriff's Office (PBSO), Town of Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD), Florida State Attorneys Office 15th Judicial District (15th SAO), and the Palm Beach County Medical Examiners Office (PBME) have all refused to conduct a homicide investigation, as required by Law.  NIA LEE ANKNERs surviving family has information and evidence providing probable cause to charge and arrest one KELLY ANNE MCCAULEY for 1st Degree Capital Murder.   In August of 2017, KELLY ANNE MCCAULEY and other persons yet unknown, in the County of Palm Beach, and against the statute, peace, and dignity of the State of Florida, did unlawfully from a premeditated design to effect the death of a human being, and caused the death of a human being, NIA LEE ANKNER, through the unlawful distribution of opium or any compound, derivative or preparation of opium and/or fentanyl, opium or any compound, derivative or perpetration of opium, and/or fentanyl, and which was the proximate cause of the death of NIA LEE ANKNER , did kill and murder, NIA LEE ANKNER, contrary to Florida Statue 782.04(1)(a)1, 782.04(1)(a)2, and 782.04(1)(a)3. (CAPITAL FELONY).  "Dear Governor Ron DeSantis,  I and my family pray you are well and happy; and, we thank God you are Floridas 46th Chief Executive.  My name is Charles E. Ankner. I (and my family) seek your Offices review of the information herein related to the homicide of my biological niece, Nia Lee Ankner (Decedent); with an end goal of a competent homicide investigation being performed by an authorized Florida criminal investigative entity outside of Palm Beach County.  With your being a former U.S. Navy JAG Officer, and my being a USAF Veteran and certified long experienced paralegal; Ill strive to be accurate and brief in my presentation, and yet be comprehensive.  Quite frankly Governor, we pray the information herein will make your blood boil; and, motivate you to action.  In August of 2017, the Decedent had met a former coworker-acquaintance, one Kelly Anne McCauley, for a Saturday afternoon pool swim at another persons residence near the Town of Palm Beach. Neither made it to the pool; and the Decedent was brain-dead from an opiate overdose within two-hours of meeting that day with McCauley. McCauley also delayed calling 911 for twenty-minutes while instead calling her newly estranged boyfriend. By the time McCauley did call 911, eighty-percent of the Decedents brain was dead.   Admittedly, the Decedent also had a blood alcohol level of 0.15 in her system at the time of her brain-death. The combination of an opiate supplied by McCauley and ethanol caused the Decedent to stop breathing in the presence of McCauley while she purposefully delayed summoning help. In fact, besides after a twenty-minute in calling 911; McCauley did nothing to render help to the Decedent (rescue-breathing, flag down other cars for help, going into the Office of the Condo parking lot where they were at). McCauley, beyond a reasonable doubt, after supplying a fatal illicit opiate to the Decedent actually and proximately caused her death; and McCauley also for twenty minutes stood-by and let the Decedent suffocate to death.   Kelly McCauley has a long criminal record in Palm Beach County, including for but not limited to: illicit controlled substance use and possession, illicit drug paraphernalia use and possession, solicitation of prostitution, felony armed robbery, felony battery, felony grand theft, and destroying, tampering with, and concealing evidence. In my review of her criminal record; McCauley has always pled-out and never served more than a few months in the Palm Beach County Jail.  Tragically, McCauley is an all too common Palm Beach County catch and release felon. Even more tragic; McCauley was arrested only four-months before murdering the Decedent by Palm Beach County Florida Highway Patrol, for illegal possession of Xanax; with the driver of the car she was in unconscious and the car against the center barrier of Interstate-95. McCauley has lost her driving privileges due to several DUIs.  The Decedent had no criminal nor arrest record.  The motivation for PBPD Officers to resist, soft-peddle, or obstruct any and all related criminal investigations is that instead of concentrating on McCauley related to the Decedents condition and ultimate death; the PBPD exclusively concentrated on collecting evidence against the Decedent for DUI. In other words, PBPD Detective Lawrence Mennetti and Sgt. Scott Duquette screwed the pooch by not processing the scene and detaining McCauley pursuant to Florida Statute. Thereafter, Detective Mennetti performed what believe to be a half-stepped sham investigation in the incident and concluded no crime was committed in our jurisdiction..  Just a draft. How am I doing?   https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/palm-beach-county-opiate-massacre-reality-over-charles-ankner-cp/

yes I love border Lies https://www.facebook.com/georgehtakei/videos/vb.205344452828349/568194156980132/?type=2&theater
yes WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yes Walls can easily be overcome. Very stupid. Dig under. Use a ladder and go over it.  Its just so stupid.
no Well said, Michael.
no We can safely live w/o walls in Germany. We've teared them down in 1989. We don't need an arsenal of automatic firearms in every household.......and we have a community which cares for refugees in solid living conditions. That's where the difference is to be lead by a government without everyday lies
no Mary Zaggy so??? Did anyone say he was?
yes Sandra Nastasi Gaston what invasion?
no Id much rather my next door neighbor slice my sons throat.  Such a stupid post!
no Hal Bannasch  beware of the bull when your inside the wall
yes U.S. Law Enforcement Failed to See the Threat of White Nationalism. Now They Dont Know How to Stop It.  For two decades, domestic counterterrorism strategy has ignored the rising danger of far-right extremism. In the atmosphere of willful indifference, a virulent movement has grown and metastasized.  https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/03/magazine/FBI-charlottesville-white-nationalism-far-right.html
yes Lynn Limauro Floyd  sorry to another broken heart
no Trump doesn't care about the people killed by American citizens who shouldn't have had a gun, those who die because they can't afford their medicine, the veterans who commit suicide. He cries crocodile tears over a few select dead people who support his talking points.
no Build that wall...an enforce it!!!!

no President Trump, I highly doubt you will see this. When is the government going to crack down on employers who hire illegal immigrants? My social security number was stolen in 2005. I have filed police reports and have reported to the FBI in regards to undocumented workers using my name and social. The government has zero interest in protecting our identities. I was told that much from the lazy POSs who run identity theft.GOV. I just got a letter from the IRS today to verify my identity and it may now take up to 4-6 weeks more for my refund to be released when my return was accepted on January 29, 2019. I am so sick of Washingtons state liberal agenda. Someone who steals and the company who assists them should be prosecuted. Im so sick of having to prove who I am every single time I deal with a government agency. How is this wall going to keep anyone safe if the Feds can not even put the hurt down on those who are killing, stealing and assisting? Should be mandatory that every employer use E-Verify. Theft is theft and those stealing and knowingly hire individuals with stolen American names and social security numbers should be locked in the same jail cell.
yes now if it was a demovrat president no one would say anything if he wanted a wall  they would all agree but since its a republician pres its a different story
no Build the wall build the Wall
no Shane Crabb Funny people only agree once something happens to their family
yes https://mediaassets.abcactionnews.com/photo/2018/02/16/wptv-parkland-victims-tease_1518799799536_78153451_ver1.0_640_480.jpg
yes Matt McNamee Nic Harcus
no Stacey Britton listening to boots on the ground and fighting to give them what they need.
no I agree.
yes Walls work.
yes my heart go out to you but how did the Illegal immigrants get in the country I bet it was at the point of entrance
yes Except for the fact that, you know, a wall would of prevented it....
no The Las Vegas mass killer was an illegal immigrant? The Sandy Hooks mass killer was an illegal immigrant? Crazy and mentally ill people are everywhere amongst us. And at the top of the US government but it doesn't justify the fake demand for that wall
yes Point is we don't want to add to the criminal element already here! Come here legally  -  PERIOD!!!!!
no Every death of an American by an illegal immigrant is on the hands of the Democrats.  The truly sad part is that they don't care.
no Impeach.
no The politicians in DC are insulated from this.  If Nancy Pelosi or Chuch Schumer child were killed by an illegal.  I wonder what they would think them?
no if it was your highest priority you would address internal gun violence.  you are a blowhard and a dimwit.  if it wasn't for daddy's money you would starve.
yes Do you think we're STUPID, Trump?!! We ALL know that you inly ean your second attempt at becoming POTUS on the wall only AFTER your FIRST attempt at running on Obama's birth certificate failed MISERABLY!!!! You don't care about who's here legally or not, or even who was born here or not, you are just doing all you can to prevent/stop the possibility of any more people of color running for POTUS!!!!!
yes Rafael Garcia Hector David Murguia Gastelum
no Oh Lord
no Paul Packer  yep mentally ill! Problem is they are hard to find! So what the hell you expect the government to do?
no Stop killings.
no Pig  trump will naver make the wall he said mexico  will pay for it.
yes I will Help with the Wall tell me where and when
no Because safety it's  comment sence why we make our border wall
yes Sorry for your loss however government statistics show more people are killed by the general population than by undocumented immigrants
no Build the wall to hell with the democrats
yes https://www.westernjournal.com/ct/obamas-national-emergencies-went-double-digits-still-effect/ congress does not care about the people who elected them. They did not question the crap obama called national emergencies
no Marlin J Reid
no Legal citizens are shooting up schools, workplaces, country music concerts, movie theaters, shopping malls. But that is a-ok by Trump. Not a word about the shooting last week.
yes its so heart breaking for all these senseless killings i never wish evil on someone but maybe if nancy pelosis grand daughter got butchered  and killed horribly maybe shed grasp the reality of the situation ..it surely proves mr trump cares about us and it truly proves the left could care less  about us...the left is americas greatest threat to losing our independence and freedoms  and lives   im 100%  for that wall and maybe send all traitors on the other side of that wall because they dont belong on this side of it
yes If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
yes Yes    BUILD THE WALL
yes Leftist love the blood of innocents being spilled. If they're not brutally killing babies they're exposing us to unnecessary violence and risk.  BUILD THE WALL!
yes Trevor Valescu Bc be likes to see autists flip their lid the moment he does something they dont like.
yes Yesterday, an illegal was driving recklessly and killed a guy changing his tire on the side of the road. We are a sanctuary state so the illegal will likely walk free.
no Is that why you signed the bill that doubled the H1 visas and advocated for the highest level of legal immigration, so more can come steal American jobs. As long as they do it legally tho right? Smh turned out to be just another cuckservative
yes Though we have many steps still to be taken and we are thankful for the many steps that have been taken these past two years, the wall is the next step toward America's hope for survival as the Republic for which it stands. Thank you, President Trump. May God continue to bless you and all of us Americans as we strive to continue on our journey toward ONE NATION UNDER GOD INDIVISIBLE WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.
yes The dums arent going to support the wall until it hits home for them
no Uh I'm sure 1000x more daughters are killed by legal citizens than are killed by illegal immigrants.
no One stole hole usa
yes How about all the children killed on schools?  It is always horrible when a child is killed...but we also have home grown terrorists.
no God family guns & Trump  Order Tshirt here : https://viralstyle.com/laivanhoa01121991/god-family-guns-and-trump
yes One of the easiest answers is to make sure only citizens can get any government benefits and no illegal will ever be a citizen.
no Have you not seen the economic numbers bro? The middle class and every facet of America is improving.
yes And what are you going to do to protect American families from getting shot by a crazy American gun lover?
no Just put that dude's forehead on the border. No one can climb that thing.
no And enforce all the laws that Democrats would like to do away with.
no Sad to see this man has lost his lovely daughter. However, this is still not a national emergency.
yes Wall
yes Build The Wall Mandatory E-verify Pass RAISE NumbersUSA.com
no Build the wall, demo. Are the only ones who don't want a wall,that want the vote,s
no Shady Ghaly you must live in a state that has really high taxes.
no Who's going to build a wall to protect all these innocent kids who are being killed at schools or a wall to protect all the innocent people at there work place or a wall to protect all the innocent people who goes to the movies or nite clubs? Because it WASNT AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT who killed them!! IT WAS A LEGAL US AMERICAN who killed them innocent lives!!
no IM SO SORRY FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAS LOST THEIR LOVE ONES IN THE HANDS OF A CRIMINALS.  BUT, WE CANNOT BUILD A WALL AROUND ALL THE AMERICANS CITIZENS WHO COMMIT A CRIME AND KILLED OUR LOVE ONES TOO, SO, A WALL, IS NOT THE ANSWER TO THIS PROBLEM.
yes People on government assistance support a wall the taxpayers have to pay for.
yes How will you continue to blame immigrants for everything after the wall?
yes we know we need it...that's why we voted for you...be the dictator they think you are and get it done and then step down..you're the only one who cares about us
yes Build the wall ! Impeach pelosi ! Pray for the Father and his passed daughter.
yes Pax Americana
no Jennifer Smith "moran"?  You're the moron.
no Yes we sure do
no Oh yes ... God Bless
yes Keep after it Mr. President, you are our hero.  Build a lot of wall.
no NO CRISIS NOTHING TO SEE HERE.  sacr..
yes Americans face consequences,  illegals do not.  They get deported only to run right back.  And....how many children are trafficked across that border every year?
yes Aurora, Parkland, Newtown, Charleston, Las Vegas, Columbine, Pittsburgh Synagogue, Sutherland, Aurora, etc etc etc etc etc etc et etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc incidents of mass murder...  THiSis the National Emergency...not the border
yes George E Simpkins Jr  its call news.
yes Until we support Americans I'm not worried about immigrants having more resources than me. The wall will save us $100 billion plus a year supporting immigrants on welfare. I'm good  #WallsFixEverything
no Wow
no Build the Wall!!!!! Hurry
no Sorry for ur lost sir!!
no Matt Justice
no It have TO be horrible but people get kill every day for no reason white man kill wife and kids son kill girlfriend brother his parent's grandmother son kill his family mother father brother even the dog  now this people are AMERICA citizens what do we do with them !!!!! Think
yes I have a friend whose grandson was just struck while riding his bike by an illegal driver who was drunk.  He survived, but has broken bones.  He is young, and most probably will have problems for the rest of his life. I lost my sissy to murder in 2009. The only thing that would have made the grief more unbearable, would be if she had been murdered by someone who wasn't even suppose to be in the country!  They are not sending their finest to America, and there are terrorists coming over that border too!  WE NEED TO BE SECURE!
yes Richard Rouse  So dumb
no Kris Kline Give sources..
no Build the cotton pickin thing at any cost.
yes A white man with a shitty haircut killed my brother. Guess we gotta ban trump too. Just to be safe.
yes "Against that backdrop, it was Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood) and former state Senate leader Kevin de Len who first began to chart the states course in confronting Washington, releasing a joint statement the day after the 2016 presidential election declaring California the new keeper of the nations future.  If CA is indicative of the "nations future" the USA is doomed. President Trump is astute to this snd trying to stop it.   newsom is a weak, naive, puppet for the "anchor baby politicians in CA, who are favoring ILLEGALS over US CITIZENS. I hope the Feds cut off $$ to CA, it's the only hope to stop the insanity.   http://enewspaper.latimes.com/infinity/article_share.aspx?guid=97518f04-32d5-446a-b4fe-54e87a09a237
yes You see it all most everyday were illegal kills ,rape children, rape women, and kill law enforcers.
no Finally, after decades of empty promises, a President with a backbone that will build the wall. God put Trump in the White House We are with you-God speed #Trump2020 
yes If families or mothers are called angel families & angel mothers of those killed by illegal aliens. What are the parents/families/mothers of those killed by American citizens referred to as? If ICE & Border patrol would do their jobs & if American citizens would stop using drugs & if companies would stop hiring illegals (like Trump) we wouldnt have a problem. Five year olds killed at Sandy Hook & Vegas concert massacre & Parkland. What are these families called? SOL???
yes Of course, nobody on THIS side of the wall will kill anyone, right?
yes I would vote against a border wall. Only if all politicians tear down the walls / fences they live behind. Along with doing away with all of their security / armed body guards. Let's see which happens first.
yes Carol Zuback Alexander ,trump wants to grab you by the pussy. Well, maybe not you
no US Bombs killed 9,781 civilian people in Iraq to date. Where does the wall go again?
yes PRES. DONALD TRUMP
no 85% of kids killed by guns in the world die here in the USA. But that's no crisis...
yes Build that wall! An illegal killed my 11 year old nephew also.
yes Dont wait until its your loved one!
yes As for Mexuco not paying it...oh they will.Now they have to take care of the people that live there because they cant get here.The funny thing is they didnt want the caravans going thru either and lol the people in Mexico were protesting the fact they were invaded.Aint that a kicker
yes And another illegal killed a girl 27yrs of age
yes You are the EMERGENCY. Putins puppet.
no I don't think he wants to memorialize the death of his daughter by the deaths of thousands of immigrants at the hands of CIA backed meddling south of the borders.  You only hear about the fear mongering about MS13...Trump forgets to tell you how the caravans started. He forgets to mention intel has it that when he invades Venezuela there will be more caravans.  Just like he promised you tax breaks but only gave it to the 1%.  He's right when he said the people are stupid enough to believe him.
yes Mass shootings occurred the other day and you still do nothing
yes www.craigher-shop.atcraigher-shop.at
yes Don't worry you will do it to yourselves what's been done by immigrants, dishonest Americans who are thinking everyone is after them like the revelation 2,9 and 3,9 you will come to worship song of Solomon 1.5,6
yes Illegal immigrant saved the life of two police officers in Houston pulling them out of a burning squad car.
no What else can i say rather than to thank Doctor  who God used to reunite my marriage. Each day of my life, i ask God to bless Dr. momo for he has made my life complete by bringing back my husband to me and for this reason, i made a vow to my self that i will testify on the internet to let the world know that Dr. Iyamu is a God on Earth. My husband and i had a fight for three days which led to our divorce. On this faithful day, i came across a testimony of how Dr. Iyamu helped a lady in getting back her lover. So, i contacted him and explained to him and he told me that my days of sorrows are over that my husband will come back to me within 12 to 16 hours.. Could you believe it, my husband came home begging that he needs me back. I will recommend anyone in need of help to reach him on his Email:( doctormomo112@gmail.com ) or you can WhatsApp +13478678744
yes Long live president DONALD TRUMP.  If you love America  vote  for TRUMP 2020 the best president of USA..
yes I'm more than disappointed in the GOP, especially Rand Paul! Stop playing fair with them! They're not fair with you or us! Start naming names and exposing them every time they vote against you! Tell it all! You're entirely too kind, sir.

no I pray that all you folks that support these idiots that are fighting Trump on The Wall never have to feel the horror of losing a child or any family member to violence or drugs brought here by these illegals, because if you did you would feel different!!!
yes How many illegal immigrants committed mass murder or even murder as compared to home grown American men?  Lets start by throwing you out!
yes It won't hurt to do the wall that's for sure ,  wall will work among other security measures .  While its true you can't blame all crimes on Illegals people should come in legally. Every country in the world has that expectation , no one will let you cross over illegally
yes WHAT ABOUT THE BIGGER PROBLEM THE GUN MASS MURDERS.
yes And of the 5 Americans gunned down yesterday..?
no You're a plonker, Donald.
yes Why do Democrats idolize and protect illegal alien killers?
no One of the smartest leaders in history besides Kim Jong Un
no Kathy Finley Hayden and that is an issue to deal with.  That does not mean we can ignore other problems.
no Key word, illegal
yes The BIBLE is PrezTrump's favorite book-- Luk 6:30  Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.  Luk 6:31  And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.  Luk 6:32  For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.  Luk 6:33  And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.  Luk 6:34  And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.  Luk 6:35  But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.  Luk 6:36  Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.  Luk 6:37  Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:  Luk 6:38  Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.
yes Senator Lindsay Graham is now talking about a "coup" by the FBI as well as others !     Yet with a straight face, he's now calling for a hearing, because he's so shocked to hear about all of this ?!   Perhaps its time to remind him ,that he along with the other 7 members of the Gang of 8 were told about  these investigations into Trump and his campaign , PRIOR to his election! Yet, not Graham nor any of the other 3 Republican senators ,or the 4 Democrat senators, with NO OBJECTIONS from ANY of them!!   (Information from  New book by Andrew McCabe) &   PRIOR to the Comey firing!  The Gang of Eight (in 2016) consisted of the following four Democratic and four Republican senators  Sen. Michael Bennet, D-CO  Sen. Dick Durbin, D-IL  Sen. Jeff Flake, R-AZ  Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-SC  Sen. John McCain, R-AZ  Sen. Robert Menendez, D-NJ  Sen. Marco Rubio, R-FL  Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-NY  Is it really any wonder that McCain, knowing this, as well as what Trump was saying about finer examples of Americans then himself, .that McCain didn't want TRUMP at his funeral?!
yes Well said to hear and see for sure but bad news from TEXAS MAGA country.  El Paso has filed a law suit against Trump  I thought there was a HUGE Rally ?  well yes they were bused in true  Gov't has taken acres of land from an old couple to put up a fence they don't want.  What is going on is the Texas Romance over ??
yes Ahmad Mahmoud Ouch! That hurt! Smh
no One angel family does not a crisis make!!!!  Trump declares national emergency...  Nobodys done the job that weve done on the border,  said Donny as he declares a national emergency today........the slowest emergency in history.  And with the lawsuits that will ensue, his wall will not be funded or built until after the next election...if ever.  THE WORLDS SLOWEST EMERGENCY!!!!!  Donny lied directly to Americans about his border crisis.  Our Liar-in-Chief said that all the data that refutes his crisis designation is lies.  Got that?  Our president told the American people that THE FACTS ARE LIES...this is what all wannabe dictators say.  This egomaniac is THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!  Donny doesnt seem terribly concerned about this crisis.  He plans to travel to Florida mere hours after declaring the emergency from the White House. A president, in times of strife, would typically stay in the nations capital to oversee the crisis. Donny plans to do so from the comfort of his weekend getaway.  In reality, Donny is preparing the country for a fake war as he plans to enjoy a mini vacation. The only national emergency in America right now is one of leadership!!
yes Too bad it wasnt one of theirs.
no Sorry for your loss, but also sorry you blame an entire group of people. Fact: illegals, and especially Hispanics, who we are really talking about, commit less crimes (per person) than our citizens. Fact: no one with knowledge of the situation, like the Republican congressman whose area is 2/3 of the entire border, thinks that a wall is going to work. What is working and improving constantly is technology and manpower to monitor the gates(where almost all drugs and illegals enter), and drones to cover the expanse, sea and air, where the rest of the drugs enter.  The wall was a failed campaign promise by a man with zero knowledge of the actual problem. The group to blame for you senseless loss are ALL drunk drivers.
no No question!  Let's get it done!!
yes Terrible
yes Fucking liar! You are using the personal tradgity of others for political gain. That is all you are doing. There have been thousands of Americans and continue to be every day who are gunned down before their lives ever begin and you speak out when on that? Never!  Again, you are simply using the personal suffering of American families for your personal political gains and you are a slime ball and a disgusting fake slime ball at that!
no Terrorising China won't
no My mom was killed in car accident by a rich kid who was white in 2002.  There are lot of people of different races who are bad.  Trump never mentions other shootings like aurora shooting.  So don't say wall is good it is bad and people crossing the border are lower than they were in 2000.
no Photo of the victims of the Oklahoma Bomber, killed by a homegrown terrorist.    https://scfop3.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bf877da9cc2bde14d3f4f10e4d2e038f.jpgscfop3.orgscfop3.org
yes One of sister's best friends was killed by an illegal immigrant.  There were 3 illegals in the car.  The driver never even slowed down at the stop sign on a side highway and was speeding.  He hit her while she was driving the speed limit of 65.  She was life watched but didn't survive long.  The 3 men weren't even injured.  They had no insurance and actually tried to hire an attorney to sue the husband of the woman he killed.  They got out of jail somehow and fled back to Mexico.  I always wonder how long it took them to cross back into the states and how many other crimes they've committed since then.
no Illegal immigrants have been a problem for decades.  The National Parks Service and the Border Patrol have been focused on the issue for decades.  It's time to fix this long time problem.
yes The Border Patrol is inept. They need to be fired......
yes They haven't only killed but raped pillaged and plundered their way across America. Sure there are some decent ones. But when a child of illegal parents tell me this is their country and it doesn't belong to me or any American my blood boils. That they have the right to be here. Its their country, just taking it back from us. How would you feel. Shut the border down and put sanctions on mexico they will pay for the wall to be built. No trade in or out. No one in or out, No money going to their banks and confiscate those dollars. That would more than pay for the wall. in 2017 they sent 56 billion back to Mexico. Don't you think its time we got some of our tax dollars back?
yes MAGA WALL
no What about the illegal immigrant that shot all those people yesterday and ... oh ... this is awkward.  Fun fact: you are far more likely to be murdered by a Trump supporter than by an undocumented immigrant.
yes IF NO WALL NOTHING WILL MATTER!
yes After living near the border and knowing people who worked for border patrol it would be wiser to bring the military home and put them on the border and get rid of the bad border patrol  !  He would win on two fronts bringing military home and saving money because they are home and can be near families and it would be better then the wall.  They should sell all majuana  to place selling it legally to raise money for wall and anyone bringing hard drugs should face a firing squad that will stop drugs and he would be re-elected.
yes DJ Trump and MC Pence!
no yup
no Guns kill far more than illegals.
no You would do the whole world a favor, including America, if you just legalized everything and bankrupted the cartels
yes Keep wall up
no I can see why you arent a politician
yes Agree 100%, Most Americans Are Truly Sorry For Your Loss, I Back Our President And The Wall Is Critical For The Safety And Security Of All Americans. Im An American Hispanic Deplorable And Wear The Label Proudly 
yes Sandra Nelson Ask the Chinese: Or the French. Trump wants to ignore the stats saying illegal immigration has been declining for two years, cause he just wants his wall. He's a freakin' xenophobe and frankly when he's gone THEN we can start being great again
no Get it Mr. Trump
yes I'm sure if a family member of theirs was raped or tortured or murdered they would be singing a different tune! They're only concern is for their own agenda! They do not care about the American people one iota! It sickens me that innocent lives are destroyed by the illegal actions of these illegal immigrants! I am so sorry to anyone who has been affected by this travesty of justice.
yes Trump2020!
yes I  REALLY  PRAY PRESIDENT  TRUMP GETS THIS  MESSAGE.  IN DELAWARE WHERE I LIVE,  TWO  WEEKS  AGO  THERE WAS  AN  INCIDENT  TO WHERE  AND  ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WAS INVOLVED  AND  THE  DELAWARE  STATE  POLICE WAS  INVOLVED,  AS  ONE  OF THE  OFFICERS  ARRIVED I  TOLD HIM  THE  GUY  IN  THERE IS  ILLEGAL  IMMIGRANT  AND THIS  OFFICERS  EXACTS  WORDS WERE   THATS  A  PROBLEM FOR  IMMIGRATION  NOT  US.  NOW  WHY  ISNT  LAW  INFORCEMENT  DOING MORE? PLUS  I HAVE A  NAME  OF  ANOTHER  ILLEGAL  IMMIGRANT WHICH  WAS INVOLVED  IN  DOMENSTIC ABUSED  CASE  AND  THIS PERSON  WENT  TO  A  DELAWARE  FAMILY  COURT  UNDER  AND ILLEGAL  NAME, SSI ETC  BEING  USED  AND  THE  JUDGE WAS INFORMED  OF THIS PERSON  BEING  ILLEGAL,  WELL  GUESS  WHAT,  NO  OTHER  QUESTIONS WERE  ASKED AND  NOTHING WAS DONE. I FEEL AS THOUGHOUR  PRESIDENT AND  US AMERICANS  WHO ARE  DOING  OUR  BEST  OF  FIGHTING  IMMIGRATION ARE GETTING  NO  HELP  OR  SUPPORT FROM EVEN OUROWN LAWS, POLICE, COURTS  AND/OR  JUDGES.  PRESIDENT  TRUMP  WHY  ARE WE  NOT  GETTING  THE  HELP  WE NEED?
yes Bahahahaha one fucking killing and you get this?  How about the MILLIONS of lives trump has ruined?  Buncha sheep who cant think for themselves.  Believe whatever the clown says and forget how to create your own thoughts.
yes Charles Landry this is not proof of need for a wall. Illegal immigration happens primarily through Visa overstays and the other issues we have with border security are also largely through ports of entry. This is intended to bolster unthinking response by people who have poor critical thinking skills. It is transparent fear mongering.
no Build the wall and start hanging democrats from it
yes I am so sorry for your loss, that illegal would have gotten Italian justice right away no time for American justice today these people get off with a slap on the hand when they commit heinous crimes and it's unacceptable, build the damn wall already.
no Who exactly??? Because stats don't support a barrier wall.
yes Hop Sing
yes Walls are stupid, they dont work. Almost all crime is committed by American citizens. How about gun control if you care about our family? What's that? You cant hear me over the sound of counting the 30 million dollars NRA gave you?
no OLIVER NEWTRON BOMB PREDATOR WHITE SMOKIN LOL ARNIE NO PIGS HEART DRAGON
yes This man's story is tragic.  But securing our borders, making sure that criminals are punished and can't get back in does not translate into a physical wall.  4th century solution to a 21st century problem.
no 962 American women were murdered by their partners in 2016. Can we put a wall around men in America?
no BULLDOZE THE WALL!
no And yet, we had another homegrown shooter recently.
no Make sure theres  electric wire at the top rats and undesirable always seem to mitigate onto the good. Build The wall !  God bless Trump !
yes WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?????
yes A white guy killed my family member with a gun.   All i got was thoughts and prayers
yes Wrong
no President Trump will have the law on his side when he uses the power of his office to secure the U.S. border with Mexico.  Fortunately, both the Constitution and the Congress have placed the authority to do so firmly with the President of the United State.   Executive action may be taken where Congresss intention is unclear, and actions like the one President Trump may be preparing to take now, where Congress has already delegated the authority to act. Since Congress has already delegated the authority to act, and with funding, this is where presidential power is at its zenith, carrying almost the full undivided executive power of the U.S. government.  When the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate. In these circumstances, and in these only, may he be said to personify the federal sovereignty. If his act is held unconstitutional under these circumstances, it usually means that the Federal Government, as an undivided whole, lacks power.  The main unresolved question is simply how the President can use existing appropriations to carry out those responsibilities without new, specific bequests from Congress beyond the $1.375 billion in this latest bill.  The method is a declaration of a national emergency.  The 2006 Secure Fence Act, for example, commands the executive branch to take all actions...necessary and appropriate to achieve and maintain operational control over the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States, specifically including physical barriers. This is beyond mere implied intent of congress    Then there is the The Immigration and Nationality Act which grants the President the authority to suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.This again implies the intent of congress.  So even without the most recent Bill passed allowing funding for border physical barriers, the previous Acts already gave the executive branch clear authority to take action on border security and barriers.   Congress can not micro manage how the POTUS and his staff carries out their duties. Thats why the executive branch is seperate. Otherwise we would just let Pelosi run the country.  In this case, the emergency powers Congress has already delegated to the President are perfectly tailored to allow him to solve the border crisis. A declaration of national emergency authorizes the President, without regard to any other provision of law, to tap into funds already appropriated for military construction and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers civil works program.  Until Congress passes a new law or resolution  which would require a two-thirds majority in both houses if President Trump were to issue a veto  the legislative branch has already given the President ample authority to declare a state of emergency on the southern border and take action.
no Libtards don't care about your problems or what happened to you. They just want chaos and death to Americans period.
no Common sense Thank you President, you haters better get your head out of your asses .
yes All of us who support you will support you again in 2020 and all of us are for the wall, but wall that is made superior quality, astonishing.
yes Amazing the arrogant, ignorant people that are against the wall are so evil, I can not believe they keep thier positions.

yes Rosemary Patterson no more free handouts to the red states!  The red states are the most dependent on government assistance!

yes You only want a wall for your own selfishness
yes You all remind me of going to a dog park. All sniffing each others butts.
no Statistics show that both legal & illegal immigrants commit less crimes than native born Americans.
yes After the last mass school shooting, Democrats and the media were screaming for gun control because if it would save one life, it's worth it right? Well, if we could keep one illegal immigrant out to prevent the killing of one person, isn't it worth building the wall? In their mind, Mandy is not worth it. They don't care about Americans. Just keeping their power and votes they get from uneducated people who like all the free stuff they offer.
yes And electrify it.
yes Congratulations President, Trump for your fight to keep law and order in the Americas !!
no Immigrants can use ladders!
yes You are the best  President in the world
yes Spinning breaking the law as moral and any means to stop it as immoral is the liberal radical platform. . for votes. It's all about votes.
no How about a news feed where anyone who lost a loved one or had any criminal activity against them by an illegal start posting ...   we need a long run of reports to convince the everyday Americans!
yes An illegal  boy ,Kill my husband , certain people dont get it until God forbid it happens to them loose a person in your. Family .the pain never stop hurting never wish on no one  build  the wall 
yes So just emmigrants commit crimes  low blow #antiwall
yes You're a jackass.
no And what good will it do when they are stealing elections and plotting our nations downfall? We have less than two years and you have already lost much support because the real pedophiles are still in office or enjoying retirement. Let's not even get started on interventionism and helping globalists seat their puppet in Venezuela or B. Barr.
